Real_Use_3216,"It’s no different than undergrad. School is school.Their mentor ship is assigning you someone from another practice or maybe even another town to converse with. The “owners” of those clinics may mentor you in person also.You just take a job knowing you will make mistakes it’s part of it. But it’s only a mistake if you do not learn from it.  It’s called practice for a reason. A lot of people make this job out to be something it’s not. Just go to work. Practice, learn, and do your best.The field is changing and will change for the worse I’m afraid.Do your best. You will make mistakes. Learn from them and move on with life. That’s the point of it I think. Learn and grow.I was offered something similar. Essentially in my mind this is what these offers boil down to with these corporates. You are “5%” owner but perform 100% of owner duties day in and day out. Need to hire someone, inventory needs ordered, staffing disputes, angry clients, practicing medicine? You will be in charge of all of this basically running the practice 100%. And only taking home “5%” of the profit. While your corporate partners keep the other 95%.  I ultimately decided not to go into “owner ship” with these corporates.  Especially since they pay good associates so well.One of my classmates failed the first time. Did not study for the second one and passed no problem. It’s a silly test that doesn’t really gauge how you will be as a veterinarian.No matter what the schools say, be well rounded etc, they really only care about gpa. A 3.2 is low you need to boost it up.Loving animals is not a reason to become a veterinarian.Rough seas make good sailors. It’s all part of learning. Other than perfecting your knots I’d recommend strengthening your hands. Pull ups etc help in a big way.I’m not sure I’ve met a practice owner who I would describe as a “happy person”Whenever you decide it’s time, then it’s time.I earn production on everything I touch from preventatives to vaccines to surgery’s etc. it’s a great way to be paid. The harder you work, the more you see, the more you make.Focus on practicing good medicine and surgery AND being efficient. The production money will come if you do that. Hard no5am CrossFit.

shinytoyguns1,"I have a serious problem with everyone here that says they came in on their days off and spent 24x7 learning as a new grad. This is an unhealthy behavior. Just because this is something once commonly done, doesn't mean this is something you should propagate onto the next generation of vets. This really needs to stop. People cannot be expected to live to work and be well rounded healthy individuals. 

This practice has 6 days a week to figure out when they can provide mentorship and they are failing with over 100 hours at their disposal to teach.If you're only getting one day a week off, there are 6 other days to dedicate to learning, advancement, and improvement. I think it's awful of the practice to not respect this boundary. Besides with one stupid day when else are you going to get all you other life things done like laundry, shopping, and mental decompression. This pay your dues mentality is what's wrong with this job.Post said they worked 4 days then did an entire weekend on-call solo where they worked both days. That's 6 days.Non traditional, different field completely. Had the bare minimum shadow hours at time of application. It was COVID lockdown times but I think there were enough animal hours and varied experiences that another free hundred hours would not have made a difference.I would say it's not about how many times you apply but what you do with the time in between applications.Go to the cheapest school. You'll potentially be going out of state for vet school and that's really expensive. I went to two no nothing undergrads and got in based on other things. Prestige of undergrad usually just means classes that are unnecessarily harder or more competition for no reason. As long as you take your science labs at a 4-year, that's what matters most besides keeping your gpa up.My experience isn't exactly a gap year experience but it does track with this thread in terms of stigma. I had to take a medical leave of absence after the birth of my son. The pregnancy almost killed me and I couldn't return. It gave me a full year with my baby I would have missed out on otherwise. Falling back a full year ended up not being bad at all. I get along with my new classmates much better and I have reprioritized what really matters in vet school. People think getting held back a year is like the worst thing ever and not only is it pretty common, it really was the best thing for me.They have not made a final decision but you have made a good impression. I wouldn't say you got the job just yet but I'd be optimistic about your chances.If you've told clinics that you are interested in working at you've taken it, a simple statement like you'll be taking it again in the spring will suffice. I know people that were hired on before passing. I know one vet that had to take it 4 times and no one treats her any different than any other doctor. All new prospective employers don't need to know that you took it at all.Note to self for future.....buy more vodka in 1.5 school years. Ty kind sir I will not forget this.","Other.

Disneyfreak77,"I did surgery through my pregnancy. Totally safe as long as all equipment is up to date and functional. 
But if you’re not comfortable, talk with your doctor and your boss and see if a compromise can be made..Reasons I didn’t bother to specialize. It was much less stressful to go straight into general practice with fixed hours and a competitive salary than going for an exhausting underpaid internship. Where I did my clinical rotations, the internship salary was like 32,000 a year. With our outrageous student loans, no one could live on that. It’s ridiculous.

I’ve always thought since I was in vet school that the system is broken, but I don’t think it’ll ever be fixed.Fellow Rossie here 

I hated fourth year clinics. I never thought about quitting because frankly it just wasn’t an option. I was up to my eyes in debt from school and needed to finish so I can get that job and start making real money.

But man I hated clinics. They work you to the bone. I found it draining just as a single person living alone. I can’t imagine having gone through it with a whole family, especially young kids. 

I definitely thought there was a stigma against Rossies too. We def weren’t treated the same as the in state students.

But it was worth it to stick it out. Now I work as a GP 3 days a week, no on call hours, 2-4 weeks of PTO, paid CE and licensing, and lots of support. Oh yeah, a 6 figure salary doesn’t hurt either. 

My advice to you is to power through. Once you get the degree and the license, there are so many doors open to you. You can take a low stress job like at-home euth or GP or just do spay:neuter clinics or whatever you want. Just think of the end goal. You can do this!","Medical Doctor.

Feral80s_kid,"There’s so many avenues! 
You could work in a rehabilitation practice, or a holistic practice, for example.Ask around as far as what type/amount of support team you’ll have also! If they have good, experienced Vet Techs, they will be of great help to you!Think of it this way, these situations are learning experiences. It’s far better to make these mistakes in a supervised situation where you have a safety net and other professionals that will catch them (before they can seriously impact a patient’s health) 
I taught in a vet tech program for many years. And when we’re in lab situations with live animals, I would tell them, “This is your safe space to make mistakes. Make these rookie mistakes here while you’re supervised, so you don’t make them in the real world”  

Take that pressure to be “perfect” off of yourself and see if that helps with the mental health issue! 

We’re pulling for you!“Then told that I…” Delve into your employee handbook and see if this is actually a requirement, and what exactly IS required. If it’s not in there, then they can ask you politely if you’d work overnights, but you’re not obligated to. If the handbook states that you need to complete “X” to move into exotics, and you’ve completed “X” then hold them to it. It’s THEIR rules, after all. Ask around in the exotics dept. if they HAD to complete a year in overnights. If not, they are holding you to a different standard and you could actually have basis for a lawsuit. 
Employers are allowed to treat employees like poo, but they have to treat EVERY employee equally like poo (or else they are discriminating)
Sounds like you’ve gained a lot of valuable (and portable) experience at their insistence and on their dime. If they insist on holding you to it, politely decline and take your skills elsewhere.

kindaBigBetch,"Experience and learning from your colleagues/classmates will  help! No one is able to know 100% and your learning doesn't stop once you graduate. If you don't know or fully understand something right this moment, you still have the potential to learn it later on (this isn't a race to the graduation line). I'm sure you've heard plenty of not comparing yourself to others, but for real, focus on how you can feel confident with what you know. Your program should lay enough groundwork for you but if there's areas you think your knowledge is lacking, take those thoughts and channel it into ways to bridge your perceived knowledge gaps rather than disparage yourself.

Reviewing earlier semesters could be a good starting point to see where your basic knowledge could use some brushing up. Online resources like Merck's Manual, Clinician's Brief, DVM360 (that also has a YouTube channel), VIN/Veterinary Partner, eclinpath.com are fairly accessible and can help you explore things more thoroughly. Even consider webinars or if you can attend a conference with lectures on areas you want to know more about. 

It can become a vicious cycle of constantly measuring yourself with others and I think coming to terms with the fact there will be always be others who know more and less than you can be difficult; especially in an academically competitive, professional programs. Try and frame this more about wanting to improve for yourself rather than feeling like you need to 'catch up' to others and I think you'll have a healthier approach to learning and practicing as a future doctor.

Zestyclose_Bass6602,"Current Mizzou student who absolutely loves the program!

Perks: 2+2 meaning 2 years didactics then 2 years clinics. The extra clinical experience was extremely helpful for navle prep. However this does mean more condensed course load at the start and you have shorter summers. 

Not many clinicians that I don’t love. The vast majority are fantastic teachers and very kind. Of course there’s always a few exceptions. 

Lots of elective time and off blocks in clinics that makes it easy to plan externships at other hospitals and feel out places you might want to work at. I definitely think this is more than most schools. From those I’ve talked to some only get one to two weeks off campus but we have roughly 17 weeks of time off (do what you want externships or just chill, go on vacation) and 10 weeks of elective time all of which can be arranged to be off campus if you want. 

Oh and in state tuition after 1 year if you’re out of state was a big plus. It’s pretty much guaranteed as long as you meet specific requirements like earning $2,000 in the first year and staying in Missouri during your first summer (you’re allowed 14 days out of state during the summer months)

scythematter,"No. I had a great time in vet schoolNope . Me and the other two vets at my clinic are constantly busy-10 hour day with no lunch busy. And have been consistently for yearsYes. I have 2-3 days off a week and every other weekend. I hike, forage, go on car trips with our car club, knit and get tattooed regularly.You could also consider investment finance in the veterinary industry. Lots of opportunities there. Look up Fritz WoodsYou’re never going to learn and improve if you don’t put the work in-and this means spending time on your day off learning. I’ve been out 17 years and STILL jump at an opportunity to shadow my boss (of 17 years). And he does the same with me.Sure. But in the real world splenectomies, fractures and foreign objects don’t come in on your schedule. Don’t complain that you haven’t done one of those procedures then decline an opportunity to do one or assist in one. 
I have a similar situation with an individual I mentor-she complains she wishes that she had more skills and experience. However she either makes an excuse last minute to not come in or completely ghosts me when I offer her opportunities to do so….and i stopped asking her to come along/observe. I’m not putting time into a person if they are not willing to put time into themselves. Growth takes work and commitment. OP by all means tell your boss no when he offers to help you and teach (bc that is what he is doing)  but also expect him to also put less into your relationshipIt may also be time to find a new bossI’ve been a vet for 18 years-have yet to do a convenience euthanasia🤷🏼‍♀️That’s not what they’re sayings-this myth comes from individuals who have NEVER suffered or watched a loved one suffer, then die a slow painful death from cancer. Same goes for watching a pet go thru it. These individuals assume incorrectly that euthanasia is murder and it’s ALWAYS for convenience. I’ve watched my mother die of cancer. It changed me. I’ve lost multiple friends and family die from cancer. In the end it was ugly and painful. They lived in misery. Our job as a vet is to prevent suffering and that includes advising owners when it’s time to euthanize a pet that is suffering and has no chance of recovery. Contrary to popular belief the majority of animals (including humans) don’t have peaceful deaths.Never lie to a child about death. You don’t have to be detailed about it, but it’s unfair to them to lie. I always ask them if they understand what is happening and why, as well as if they have any questions. I tell them what I’m doing and why. Children are not stupid and are usually very perceptive in situations like this. Lying to them sets up unreal expectations later in life (like all animals die in their sleep, ect). When parents ask what they should tell their kids, I tell them that to say something like “spot is very sick and it’s time to let Spot go to heaven so she doesn’t have to hurt anymore, but Spot will be in our hearts for our whole life-we will carry her memory with us always”.No. They are interviewing others and deciding who they’ll hire. They will call you next week with an answerAs a vet of 18 years-sometimes that thing is hard to findYes. But some days it’d be nice to be a Starbucks barista. lol

I get paid well, take vacations 4x per year, my work family is great. My clients are overall fantastic. Many of my closest friends started as clients. And I’m at that age where I (and my boss) have no issue telling asshole clients to kick rocks. 🤷🏼‍♀️.We live in the south-opening day of hunting season (deer) is practically a holiday. Almost everyone at my clinic hunts-deer, turkey, hogs.Circumferential them mod millers or transfix-I call it my sleeper knot-so I can sleep at night and not worry. At least when I did spays…Midline, USAImagine being blackmailed (sued) bc your patient had an allergic reaction to an antibiotic. Cause that’s me right now. Very frustratingIt sounds like you’re getting shuffled around to fill empty spots/staffing shortagesI’ve got full sleeves AND give out my artists card to clients all the time. I’m in a semi rural conservative areaI’ve been a vet 17 years and never had a scrotal hematoma-I close the SQ with pds starting deep then mid then pick a piece of tissue midline (thin superficial tissue over penis ) and the deep mid and superficial on other side. Repeat in continuous way then close securely and do intradermal. I was taught this by Dr. Gary Ellison and have yet to have a problem-looks beautiful and is compressive in nature-no room for blood to collect. This is how I teach all my baby vets to close neuters","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

SuddenHedgehog,"It’s not uncommon for the techs to call the doctors by their first name in the back where I work. We were told at the beginning by one doctor that they didn’t care as long as in front of clients and visiting specialists, we say Dr Last Name. If it’s something that bothers you, tell the hospital manager and they should include it in a staff meeting. But it won’t ingratiate you to the techs.

As far as nit picking, I do just want to say that a lot of techs only know what they know by experience. So when you do a treatment plan or something that isn’t aligned with their experience, they get nervous. They don’t know that their actions are the right thing to do in every circumstance, they just know it’s what they were asked to do. I think that’s why some techs get rude with newer doctors. Once they see your patients are coming back healthy and happy, once they see you catch a few cool weird things, the respect will build up.Me asking questions has definitely saved us a few times, either cuz it was communicated wrong or it was the wrong thing.As someone who just got accepted to vet school, thank you. I needed to hear that lolAdvice I got was to leave your first few practices until you find one you like! You’ve got much more to explore before calling it quits.
Also, someone once told me a poison helpline would have a good work life balance and less stress. Not sure how difficult it is to get one of those jobs.Treating Vestibular cases. The symptoms are so scary, and people think they’re walking about without their baby, but then we treat them a lil while and voila, nbd.

Also love a good Addisons case. Seeing them come to after some dex and NaCl is awesomeAs a technician, I would never speak a doctor that way and as a supervisor, I would write up anyone who talked to a doctor like that. Jeez.The card is the best part

Otterwut,"I think your position is not an uncommon one. I've seen it many times in real life and seen it on this subreddit even more. I've been working in vet med for 15 years and have worked every position in the hospital at some point. I currently offer my relief services to 5 hospitals and have worked at nearly 20 in my time ranging from small single doctor GP clinics to university ECC. All this to say that, in my experience, this happens to even boarded specialists at any and all levels.

 I've worked with brilliant technicians who I would trust over some doctors and whose advice is absolutely golden. If you have one of those in your clinic then be a sponge and learn all you can from them. Their experience is invaluable and a good tech is a life and license saver. You will make mistakes and they will help you catch them. 

Unfortunately, a substantial amount of the techs/assistants you're working with will not be these people. A large amount of the work force for nurses are on the job trained and have only worked at maybe 1-2 hospitals for a few years. They don't know what they don't know, and I can say this because I went through that gauntlet myself. The more I've learned the quicker I am to pause and think about why someone may have done something they did. There's a good chance the people giving you trouble are the ones who fall in this category. It boils my blood to see how pervasive it is to have nurses who don't even understand why decisions are being made criticize doctors for them. There are multiple boarded specialists I've seen get shit on by nurses who when pressed for more details about exactly what they did wrong could either only provide wrong information, are lacking SIGNIFICANT context clues or base knowledge to even understand what they're judging, or just don't have anything worth while and just like the drama. The people who lack this knowledge are the quickest to judge and those who know the most tend to be more patient and understanding. This has been true for pretty much every single one of my 18 clinics I've worked at. 

My best advice is to see where this advice is coming from. If it's from a trusted source who means well then absolutely forget your ego and absorb anything you can. If it's from the clinic drama queen with the over inflated ego then just ignore it and move on. You have too many more important things to do than pay those type of people even a minute of your dayUnless youre refusing on calls (which is only a very small percentage of surgeons) then expect to work \~40-50 hours completely excluding your on-call time. Its what made me stop pursuing surgery as a specialty. I looked around at every surgeon at all the hospitals I worked at and realized not a single one had a work/life balance I would be happy withVery classic case of them thinking they know way more than they do. They quite literally don't know enough to even differentiate what makes a good vs bad vet. You have a toxic coworker problem not a you problemDepends on what your definition of worth it is. It's a large investment upfront and requires the ability to constantly be learning and growing. There's a ton of responsibility and half your job is basically client communication. Being a good doctor is only half the job because of this unfortunate fact. Debt load is high but so can the salaries be. I do relief, can make anywhere from 200-400k depending how hard I want to work, set my own hours, get to do something I love and live exactly the type of life I want. For me it's absolutely worth it but for many people it's absolutely not. If I had to do GP I'd absolutely quit and change fields. As with anything it's a bit what you make of itI work in SoFlo. The work isn't as reliable as COVID times but for me it's still there. Location dependent for sure. I tend to work at 24h specialty centers and most of them I just called in and asked to be put in contact with whoever could tell me if they needed any additional relief assistance. Pretty much everyone has been happy to talkI get it on my own! I'm child free and in good health so it's only like $360 for me so would be pretty minimal savings if I signed on somewhere compared to the freedom and tax deductions having an S-Corp allows meDefinitely one perk of being in my situation. VCA actually has really good health care if you are looking for a placeYea I think it's like 34 hours for full time there? Could be off +/- 2. Unfortunately I'm not sure what insurance they have though. I did briefly get into negotiations with them but ended up staying on my ownI dont necessarily think you need an internship with your level of experience but definitely need to be working at a place with good mentorship for a while. I wouldnt be rushing into overnights alone, for instance. You likely could handle the majority of things but things can get complicated quickly in ER and not having to have someone to bounce something off of ""hey this sounds reasonable right?"" can put a big burden on you if youre not prepared for itSounds like youre working at an absolute dumpster fire of a hospital. Get out ASAP and completely forget anything those garbage vets taught you.

Shot_Ad_1594,"I think it is; I spent the majority of my summer of clinical year traveling to all the clinics I was interested in pursuing an internship at. I think the same applies to potential first job places that you are interested in. I used it as a fun time to roadtrip, see family, and go new places. Your school may have additional scholarships to fund your travel as well ( our SAVMA chapter has travel grants). 

The payoff was that I made a good impression at the hospitals I externed at and was able to get a rotating internship offer outside of the match and saved money and stress during VIRMP season.Hi! I’m a current veterinary student. I worked at a Petsmart grooming salon for about a year to get animal handling experience and some client communication as well. I then used that experience to apply for vet assistant jobs! Another option would be doggie daycare facilities for a similar type of experience. 

Kennel assistant jobs typically do not require prior veterinary experience though and especially if you are hardworking and interested in veterinary medicine I don’t see why you wouldn’t be able to get an assistant job.Sure! Started with petsmart, then worked front desk at the vet school teaching hospital (really nice student job opportunity while in undergrad).

QuietNightER,"Great stuff here. I think we are headed toward a reckoning at some point. From the AVMA state of the profession the number of graduates electing to do internships has been dropping since 2012 and 2023 saw the lowest number since 2004. Eventually we may not have enough specialists practicing to support the training of new specialists.

Another big problem is the 'screw you, got mine' mentality. Whenever I bring up challenges of veterinary students or interns/residents to the state VMA or at conferences people basically laugh and dismiss complaints. Last time I looked at the AVMA officer positions the requirements were basically be an older generation veterinarian as you needed so many years of AVMA membership to even qualify. Those people don't care about new veterinarians.

I'm not sure about every specialty but at least with ECC I can take a corporate job and get paid just as much and often more than a specialist. At some point the 4+ years of fast food wages doesn't make the end result worth it.I would try reaching out to faculty at whatever university you went to and see if you can get in contact with their radiologist for suggestions (I did this for cardio a few years back). I have the same Thrall book and its the only radiology one I have so I can't add much there.

[https://www.veterinaryradiology.net/](https://www.veterinaryradiology.net/) hasn't updated in awhile but they used to have cases pretty regularly. I am pretty sure all of their images come from [http://mirc.veterinaryradiology.net/query](http://mirc.veterinaryradiology.net/query) although the previous website would be better for testing yourself.

Antech used to have a pretty big radiology CE section, but I havent seen anything about it since the candy company bought them. Looks like its still on their website though [https://info.antechimagingservices.com/education/ais-academy/](https://info.antechimagingservices.com/education/ais-academy/)University of Minnesota has an entire dissection walkthrough with pictures (http://vanat.cvm.umn.edu/carnLabs/). If you were really wanted to get a hands on view though you might try reaching out to either a tech school or vet school admin or course coordinator and ask to audit the lab portion of the course. Probably no one has asked that before and they may be skeptical so I would share some of your work when you do this.

As far as books are concerned we used Guide to the Dissection of the Dog by Lahunta and I thought it was great. For large animal we used the Clinical Dissection Guide for Large Animals by Constantinescu but I preferred Pasquini's Anatomy of Domestic Animals or Budras' bovine and horse anatomy books.Just to level some expectations you might have, there is a lot of bureaucracy in university hospitals and it's not unlike corporate practice in many regards as your hospital ultimately answers to someone from main campus. For example we don't carry oral bup for cats because then we can charge them for multiple bup ampoules instead. This is probably location dependent much like corporate practices, and I've only worked at one university so take that with a grain of salt.

From what I have seen my university cares little about past experience. We get a lot of fresh grads which may be in part due to a local veterinary technician school and the university itself offering a veterinary technologist program. You may find you are underutilized as students will be given many tasks that technicians might usually get. It is an amazing place to learn though and also a great place to work on a VTS. If you know what department/specialty you want to work with I could give more information.

From your perspective you can easily spin the change from specialty/ER to GP to university specialty/ER as you wanted to try something new with GP and realized your passion was with whatever specialty you prefer.I've enjoyed my time; there are a lot of great learning experiences. If you are applying to a public university the salary information is public so you can find out what others are making to give you a basis on what they pay.

I had a similar experience to your friend trying to work on my VTS at Bluepearl. It's a lot easier at the university hospital for a few reasons, it's easy to reach out to colleagues, its a university so most doctors there love to teach, and generally management was more supportive if I wanted to do whatever procedure for my case log. Staff level depends on the department, a lot of the specialties rely on their students so may only have a few technicians, others have many technicians but they're relegated to grunt work and treatments. I don't think they have a problem filling positions as they pay several dollars more than surrounding hospitals.

Our ICU is very boring for technicians as they basically come in just for monitoring/treatments. All of the fun stuff is done at whatever department they transfer from.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

bostoncemetery,"You can always work as a data analyst in the veterinary space too! Veterinary corporations are definitely looking for folks who have your skill set and also understand the mission of what we do. 

And a lot of them will also pay for you to go to tech school as well!Yes! I’m actually a student in that program at Purdue! It’s excellent. I work in veterinary corporate. My work doesn’t pay for it, but it’s such a great program.Pet insurance/wellness plan information is always good too! Set them up to be good clients for life!Is that weird? I’ve worked with MANY veterinarians who are hunters themselves. I don’t think that’s strange. There’s a lot of crossover there. 

You know that a lot of veterinary medicine actually revolves around food production, right?I've been a rep for pet insurance, JustFoodForDogs, and pet cremation services. 

Ultimately, what you're being paid for as a sales rep is to be ""annoying"". It's actually called ""persistence"", but it sure reads as ""annoying"" sometimes. 

Incentives can be great, but depending on the industry you'll be selling for, could potentially be illegal. It definitely was for insurance. The biggest thing is to truly believe in the product you're selling. If you do that and you genuinely believe that it'll improve life in the clinic for the team, tell them that!

Far-Minimum-1524,"I'm definitely planning on leaving. I have considered making a complaint about the manager and assistant manager to corporate as honestly the way they treat the staff is mortifying.

Because of their behaviour they have really poor staff retention of kennel assistants and receptionists (who are all usually very young, 18-22 year olds), most of them don't last more than a month or two and they find jobs at other vets.


They targeted me a lot when I first started but stopped after a few weeks. I have pretty thick skin so I didn't give them an emotional reaction and I would challenge them when they were being unreasonable.

They really want to become the employer of choice for vets and vet staff and are spending a lot of time and effort to move towards that goal.Yep.  The mentor program is one of the big ways they want to differentiate themselves.  I mentored a new grad over the past year and it went really well.  When hiring a new grad we picked someone that was going to be in charge of their mentorship (me).  I then went to MVPs mentor training course which was really helpful in talking about training and communication styles, managing goals and expectations etc.  MVP gave us time once a week (had us block off appointments) so that we could meet outside the hospital and discuss how things were going, talk about cases, goals, any changes we wanted to make and give feedback to each other on how things were going.  I had oversight and guidance from vets at the home office and my mentee sent them reviews on how I was doing as a mentor.  

We also had a pretty structured way on how we started her off with appointments to give time for mentoring and learning and didn't start increasing appointment numbers until she was ready to take in more.

Luest_Lu,"Have you worked at a vet hospital before? You should work as a vet assistant or tech for at least a year, ideally in more than one hospital to get a real sense of whether you will genuinely enjoy the field enough to put yourself through tremendous debt that will take a very long time to pay off. Vets have very long days, the emotional toll is large. Whether you are dealing with euthanasias, difficult clients, or difficult cases. There is a reason there is so much suicide in vet med. My colleague has been out of vet school for over 10 years and still have over $200,000 in debt. My friend that graduated 2 years ago has over $300,000 in debt. I am more fortunate because my parents helped pay for some of my schooling so I am currently debt free and I still occasionally question if I want to still be a vet at times. If it's your dream to be a vet and you have experienced working at a vet hospital and still have the same dream, go for it!

Regular-Relative-152,"I think she should apply to even more schools and take postgraduate courses relating to biology/animal sciences to get As. These courses can ""update"" her old GPA and she can use the grades as evidence she can handle the rigorous academia of vet med during interviews.

It really sucks she was admitted to Sydney twice but couldn't make it work :( I had to move across the world to attend vet school. It's been fucking hard but, imo, that's the price I pay to follow the dream.

How has she done in interviews? Maybe she could ask for more feedback? Good luck.\^Yeah I second KittyKat's theory. I'm sure if she was able to land an interview, she'd nail it considering her prior experience and work ethic. I'm 30 and Ive always felt like my age/maturity was more of an advantage than a hindrance at this point. I'm really rooting for your partner! Maybe she could plan for a move to Sydney ahead of time and pursue a 6th cycle :) Wishing yall the best.Vaccination is the #1 disease-preventing activity veterinarians oversee. If you think any of the patients need treatment outside of the scope of your clinic, have that convo w/ the owner and  document the recommendation in your records to cover your ass. And/or decline their request for vaccines as needed. I think, at the end of the day, documenting that you recommended further bloodwork, diagnostics, preventatives, etc. is what is gonna save your ass if the owner wants to try and pin anything on you.Mandala scrubs have soft, thick, quality fabric - but I've noticed that dog/cat hair really sticks to them! The darker colors show SO much hair. But it's a trade off because I love the sturdy material, the way they stretch, and the price point. Just get that lint roller ready fasho.

I've tried uniform advantage also. I thought they shrunk a bit in the dryer and the colors faded quickly. But while they were new, but I liked the flattering fit and buttery fabric so much they were a staple in my rotation. 

Cherokee infinity was the most polyester-feeling of these three brands imo. They were also the least clingy and most...flowy? Idk if that makes sense. I liked them when working on hot days and thought they held up well despite being thinner.

I'm on the shorter side, size M if that makes a difference idk.

When you live in a rather low income community, a lot of animals go without basic vet care due to cost. There are the shitty few that abuse the help, but not usually. Also, the Vets don't handle money factors here.. they just perform medicine :)

TheNicestRedditor,"So at this point if we haven’t heard from Florida/Colorado/Wisconsin are the chances pretty low they’re interested?I think everyone should reach out to their states’ Department of Agriculture, Trade and Consumer Protection to file a complaint./r/hailcorporateI agree… I’m essentially a glorified data engineer and if this was only impacting a few exam reports this would have been resolved already.  This is clearly a massive systemic issue and with ~8,500 candidates I don’t see how they can resolve it today unless they’ve got a large number of resources they can assign to it.I wonder if the people that saw theirs is still valid… maybe they got someone else’s results too 😅 I’d feel even worse if I saw I passed and then ended up having the wrong results lolThis is not just a privacy issue but a licensing issue.  The DATCP handles all licensing for veterinarians.  File with both if you can!I’d be very surprised if something like that would cause such a systemic issue and if so that would be a MAJOR security breach.  I would hope that would be readily identifiable to the DBA…

My guess is something happened along the line of ICVAID matching to test ID, which makes me feel like even the people that saw their results might not have the correct information even if their name and ID matched on the report.

I just read for the Nov 1-Dec 16 session there were only 6,500 candidates… I’d bet they have a few people going through each report manually to match everything up.  I just don’t see how they can resolve this in a day or two… or how candidates can even trust this is accurate.

As others have stated delaying results can have significant impact to these candidates careers.  

Dr Heather Case needs to be HEAVILY questioned about this.  There’s a number of high level DVMs that sit on the BOD for ICVA, and the fact that they’re all at a conference together and have not made a formal statement is troubling.What’s your GPA and class rank?Gonna be very competitive as others have said, many will have done research and externships as well...  solid GPA and rank though.

LdnFN,"I don’t know how often they update these tests but they’re great topic questions to look up every question. So if you didn’t do that the first time around, make a note of each question and look up and be familiar with the topic.  I’d incorporate that into your study study schedule.I’d check out student doctor forum. I don’t know if anyone uses that anymore but I used it back in the day and it had everything. One way to help figure out what’s going on is to look at if she’s getting interviews. If you’re getting interviews then you’re competitive enough to get in. If not then you need to figure out what metrics they’re using to determine the cutoff for interviews and improve that. If she’s getting interviews and no offers then you have to look at coaching for interviewing. Find out what questions they will likely ask and formulate answers to them and practice prior to the interviews. The final thing to do is to figure out what you’d do if you wouldn’t go to vet school.Most drugs developed for humans have been trialed in animals.","Other.

DangleDingo,"Our clinic has a veterinarian that’s been practicing for roughly the same amount of time you have, and had worked here previously — I’d never speak to her that way. I trust her 100% with my pets, she’d be honest if she wasn’t comfortable doing something — which sounds like you’d be forward like that as well. 

As support staff, assistants and technicians are meant to build their veterinarian up, to cheer them on when they need it. Every vet will have different styles, and just because you may be more cautious or unsure of certain situations with sick patients doesn’t mean you aren’t good at what you do. If you take longer in rooms, it’s nothing to feel bad about. Our clinic has multiple vets in a day, and I know what to expect when our “slower” doctors enter a room.

G000dawgs,"I do not have any suggestions for what you’re asking for. I’m still working in private practice but hope I can help somewhat. 

There are a few threads in these subreddits about nonclinical vet jobs. I believe you can look up government jobs through the AVMA website. People have also mentioned working for food and pharmaceutical companies, but I do not know how available those jobs are in your area. 

Based on what you wrote, I hope you find any new job asap. Even if it’s in a completely different field. Or just working at a different veterinary clinic. It doesn’t have to be a job that you’ll have to stay at for life. Just get something now that you’re not miserable at. Take care of yourself. And if you haven’t heard of [NOMV](https://www.nomv.org) check their site out. 

I have personally worked at a job that I dreaded going to. It was for different reasons than you mentioned. But I too was actively looking at ways to leave clinical practice while working there. I used what I hated at that practice to find a position at a practice that was the polar opposite. It was healing for me. 

It is expected for a veterinarian, that is new to a practice, will not generate much revenue their first year. Especially if they’re a new grad. I haven’t worked in a rural area, but I imagine the revenue working there is lower than HCOL urban areas. It is expected that as you get used to a clinic and build your clientele, that your revenue will increase. 

It does not sound like you have good mentorship where you are at. I find having a good mentor is crucial for when you’re starting out. I did an internship my first year with 100% supervision and it helped immensely because I could go through my cases with someone experienced. There are practices out there where doctors will provide mentorship. Maybe interview at other jobs that are hiring and ask if they have the capability for this. If they say they do, make sure to do a few working interviews so you can make sure you’re able to get the support you need. 

This is a field that you’re expected to grow in. A newer vet is not going to have the experience or expertise that a seasoned vet has. You’re not a bad vet, you’re just new and it doesn’t sound like you have help. I am constantly trying to learn and improve. Helps me be a better vet and to keep me from getting bored. You’re going to have to get more help in the beginning. I was on VIN CONSTANTLY my first few years out and I still use it on a regular basis ten years out. Keep studying every night. If a case was challenging, research into it more when you have time later. If your clinic uses ANTECH/IDEXX, call and talk to the Internal Medicine specialists at the lab to help you with the bloodwork you submitted. 

I hope you find something that works for you!!!! Good luck!!I seriously question your intelligence if you think not accepting $55k in today’s economy is due to a poor work ethic. The cost of living went up and so did the salaries that were offered to keep a vet at your practice. $55k is no longer enough to provide for the living expenses for most vets, especially those with student loans or living in HCOL areas. For $55k, I would rather take on a lower stress 9-5 job that didn’t require all the work and tuition costs to become a vet. I have a fantastic work ethic, and have an advanced degree in a field that is hard to get into. I believe vets should make way more than we do. Do physicians have poor work ethic too because they demand way higher pay than vets?","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

Few-Depth-3039,"Hello, ex Guelph student that had a clear shot into Dvm program and didn’t even end up applying. I originally wanted to be a vet to help animals, kinda not the biggest fan of people but will work with animals happily. Got a job for the experience and worked there for my whole undergrad. Could not wait to quit. By the end, I really couldn’t stand vet med. was just looking for a job where people aren’t exploited and everything is about the love of animals- it’s not. I went home daily depressed over how many bad owners there are or that people are paying crazy amounts for medications for their pet. The pharma industry along with terrible people ruined the industry for me. It’s super hard work, and while it’s rewarding if you like being mentally stimulated all the time, but it’s not rewarding to your pockets. Vets aren’t rich, school is very expensive, and none of the vet staff are paid fairly for the work they do. It’s really an industry of people who love animals but need to deal with a whole lot of roadblocks to show that love. One client that never left my head was a lady with a kitten with a life threatening disease, not incurable but not 100% effective and very expensive. Screw you pharma patent holders!! She didn’t have the money, called every single day to tell us her kitten was dying and it’s our fault for not helping her and we are kitten murderers. She had options- pet care loan with no interest, give kitten up to someone who can take care of it, family/friends, anything? Because nothing was not an option, unfortunately it was the one she made. Pets are belongings by law, so nothing we could do. If we paid out of pocket for every person who came in unable to afford care then there would be no business or pet care. People who can’t afford their pets need to stop! I remember a client wanting us to put her 6 year old dog healthy sweet dog down because they were expecting a baby and couldn’t find them a new home. Tired of hearing people lose their cats outside when that’s not even legal in Ontario and die so stupid fast to car, coyote or kidnapping. And are invasive species?? I never cared for the money, but this career had one hell of an impact on my mental health. Please work at a clinic during school while doing another degree you also have interest in would be my biggest advice. I got my job really easily by expressing my interest in animal care studies- hand your resume in in person. Even though it wasn’t for me, if you have thick skin and can handle seeing and not being able to do anything then go for it. You do end up helping a lot of animals and people :)I wanted to add that there isn’t a vet I’ve met that regrets it. You’ll bail before you get there if this isn’t for you. If you can deal with all the cons, the pros really are worth it. Just don’t go into it thinking you’ll be doing what you love forever, took me a very long time to realize there isn’t a job on this planet that’s entirely good and just. You’ll still end up working for someone, taking advantage of people for others benefit, just trying to get by. Work for a clinic with high reviews, I swear it means they’ll mentor you better and generally a practice really suffers when the team isn’t great. Family practices may spend more time and effort one on one with you. Seriously if you can, do this. I hold such high esteem for vets and what they do, because I found it impossible for me. The confidence and growing I did while working at a clinic was incredible and beyond worth it. I wish every pet owner had to be an assistant for a day and appreciate it 😂It is!! Also I have found that most people who are willing to take their pets to the vet at least care! You are entirely right, most of my friends actually became nurses and ones a doctor and they suffer from the same type of compassion exhaustion. It really is just a difficult field, not just in terms of studies. I don’t think anyone knows if they can handle it until they do.","Veterinarian.

balkantraveller,"Try an externship with other pathologists. They're usually smart, interesting, not super neurotic, and eager to teach, all of which I love. 

If you enjoy path but are still primarily interested in wildlife, you could have a well-paying private industry path job fund some amount of time doing wildlife vet work. Because a lot of path is remote, this gives you flexibility re: living near wildlife medicine/rehab centers. 

If all dead trumps hands-on wildlife medicine, you could try to quasi-specialize (i.e., become the go-to person) in exotic and zoo species path in an academic setting. Depending on how non-traditional you are and your appetite for further education/not making money for awhile, you could do a relevant PhD actually honing in on some wildlife/zoo/exotic niche, and the PhD is beneficial if you're interested in academic jobs. 

My point is that path is needed, versatile, and well-compensated, and that could afford you options and flexibility that are hard to arrange in most areas of vet med.Having a case study published after only three semesters of vet school seems pretty far-fetched unless someone comes in: 1) with some relevant experience (definitely happens, but uncommon) and 2) knowing they want to do path from the get-go. 

You do, however, need to build relationships with the pathologists and begin to gain experience in the field. Even if all of the paid necropsy, histo, and diagnostic lab positions are filled, figure out what you need to do to shadow and then begin to get research experience. You might want to start talking to people at your school about summer work now in case the external summer program doesn't pan out. 

I wouldn't say you're behind if you start shadowing/working/doing research this semester. Yes, there are people who know they want to do path in their first year, but most don't really figure it out until you get more exposure to the field in your second year.Amazing! I haven't seen vet med scribes in real life, but I'd heard rumors they were out there. If you're comfortable sharing, which company do you work for? Are you the only one, or are there others at your hospital?Ethical wool, bee colonies (can be rented out as pollinators in addition to the honey), or possibly ethical down, though this last option is connected to meat farming (ethical down doesn't allow for live plucking, but you could argue that pushing the needle by investing in ethical down promotes better welfare for these animals) may be reasonable options.20 hrs/wk would be a lot, though maybe you could average to that by working more over the summer and holidays. It would depend on your post-graduation goals, too. If you are interested in GP or another path you can do without additional training, you won't have the same expectation for research involvement, shadowing in your area of interest, etc., during your pre-clinical years. The pressure around grades (even at P/F schools) will also be lower if you're planning on pursuing GP. If you're interested in residency training, however, then research, clinical exposure, and networking are absolutely essential, and they can easily take up 10+ hrs/wk.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

unbuhhlievable,"Do not let people gaslight you into thinking you’re being unreasonable and unteachable. It’s one thing to willfully ignore advice from your techs due to pride and quite another to have techs speak to you rudely and treat you poorly. I think anyone with any semblance of emotional intelligence knows the difference between someone trying to help you (“I’ve seen another doc use this dose instead of this”, “maybe try this technique I’ve seen work well before”) vs belittling you (“I could have done it better/faster”, “they don’t know wtf they’re doing”)
I definitely experienced this in my first job out - an internship where the interns were treated like shit-under-your-shoe by senior docs and this behavior trickled down to some of the techs who felt the need to put us in our place as interns. Of course this doesn’t apply to all techs. In fact a vast majority were wonderful and I was happy to work with them and listen to their many stories and pieces of valuable advice. Unfortunately there’s just some people you will probably never be friends with. They likely feel insecure about their own knowledge and put others down to feel better about their skill level. You might have to just learn how to tolerate them enough to work with them. Or move jobs. I’m at another position where I get along well with ALL our techs and there is mutual respect and open communication. Made me realize that I never had a problem listening to advice/instructions coming from a tech, just didn’t like being treated like crap.

Yeah no, I confirm that to be protected, under french law, you have to have the above-mentioned details in your logs, or it's worth nothing as proof, just 'good enough' to assume you MAY be innocent, and it's up to whether or not the judge likes your face and had their coffee in the morning.

\>The government is pretty strict about these things and can shut off your internet after about 3 infractions

Yup, even though they are ""kinda"" slow. Hadopi went through so many changes, and was such a wonky system that even if I 'technically' had a fair amount of reasons to receive notices from them (and did), I never receive 2 in a short enough period that the first was still valid and counting in the X/3 counter.

&#x200B;

\>I also can not assume that the Mysterium whitelisted traffic is benign.

Exactly part of my point. The reason to run a dVPN is to not rely on ISP's or centralized VPN provider's willingness to not screw us over our data, by monitoring or selling it.

Running a D-VPN node, decentralized VPN node, for this exact reason, why should we, and how could we then rely on a 'centralized' committee/deciding entity to validate what is Ok or not to run through our connections, and how could ""validation"" ever **prevent** 'validated parties' to miss-behave, and how said centralized validation body would ever care to or be able to plea for the node runner's innocence against the infractions committed by their validated partners.Okay, great, multiple people, but still the case of one single country and jurisdiction, and still solely copyright issues.

And yes I know there is whitelisting, which basically excludes non-mysterium approved traffic, which basically excludes private users and randos all together, which basically defeats the reason I'm running a node at all, which is to give wider and less censored internet access to people, individuals, not just entities and organizations.Same, I think I had around 30 sessions from Benin, and my previous biggest client (\~24h/450GB) was from a Japanese IP.It seems they like to ping for uptime/latency, or that Netherland has a bigger community of dVPN clients.for just 2 weeks of running this node, if it keeps going at this rate every week a big client like that, I will fucking offset the powerdraw of my whole rack just with mysterium.French residential IP, I don't mind answering, I have enough old comments in french speaking of stuff happening in France that I'm already country-doxed.https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/comment/hxaexc4/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/comment/hxaexc4/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3  THIS, is the reason I run a node.

As nothing but a tinkerer, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/) is a post I made a while back when I started running a node, and [some](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/comment/hw2bwil/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) of the 'extra steps' I took and considered.

I would advocate Mysterium nodes (or any front-facing thing period) to never be ran natively, which I why I went ahead from the start with the ""unsupported"" configuration of running it on a sudoer user in its own dedicated unprivileged LXC container, and doing some fairly extended firewalling from the host (proxmox).

To be honest I would prefer Mysterium nodes to be distributed in this kind of form, as a turnkey LXC package for example. Little overhead, good perfs, and great for isolation/segregation. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/i05wele/  Well, I defo did joined the cause, and discussed both the pros and the cons and some concerns with the community:

* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/), facing a configuration issue in an LXC container due to the host's kernel type, fixing it, and discussing the security issues such mishap can cause and how to safe-guard around it.
* [Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/), sharing my amusement about my first big client on the Mysterium network, answering questions asked by other members about my configuration and how I made sure nothing can reach to my internal network, even if the proper default Mysterium node configuration shouldn't allow it.

Either way, in the meantime, people like me will keep logging and metering their node for the reasons given in this post.

I admit I just had not noticed u/peter-sovietsquirrel was part of the team, I was just focused on answering every incoming observation and opinion the best I could.

I understand about your position, sadly I doubt it would suffice in France to be out of troubles.

If it can indeed let the node-runner deny responsibility of the activity he was taken to court for, it could still lead to fines and sanctions as running a somewhat critical service without proper -*and mandatory by law\*\*(see refs)*\- traceability, allowing bad actors to stay out of reach.

In the example in Germany, the guy was contacted by Right holders for copyright issues.

In France, you're directly facing Hadopi (now the [Arcom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regulatory_Authority_for_Audiovisual_and_Digital_Communication)). Their ""notices"" are warnings you can't rebut fully without going to court, and at the third in a given time period, your uplink is shut down and cops knock at your door.

Unless you're running a website with a mail address to be contacted on concerning copyright on the same IP, there is no ""amicable step"" of just talking the Right holders out beforehand.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind though I was **NOT** raising really concerns about relatively mundane stuff like torrenting or using an other country's netflix geo-locked catalogue (even if you can still end up with sanctions like fines);

But **WAY MORE** sensitive crimes, like cyber attacks or 'child media', for which French authorities, like the [ANSSI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agence_nationale_de_la_s%C3%A9curit%C3%A9_des_syst%C3%A8mes_d%27information), would descend hard on you for being the roadblock in their investigation that made the actual criminals unreachable, and possibly charge you same as an accomplice.

&#x200B;

Concerning your no-log policy you want to abide by, **I hear you and won't push it further**, though I see it a bit as a marketing buzz-word in the VPN world which is only a matter of context.

I like transparency and control, hence why I'm much into the vision of web3.0, /hence why I would have wished node runners to have options to define AND transparently disclose their own policies about logging for every dVPN-client to see in their client interface.

All I can do now is hope that you or maybe an other network will consider it and implement it properly.

I'll still be hanging out in the community, and participating by running my node though with very custom filtering rules inside and outside the LXC container to avoid abuse.

**I take the pledge** to not stir up the topic of logging outside of [this thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/) as to not disturb the community by starting useless debates, though I would be happy to discuss it again if the question is raised officially one day.

(as such, I also added an edit to the thread.)

Running a native node to which randos will connect to isn't really the best thing either if anything goes wrong.

I would say, for sake of simplicity, your best shot would be to first run an unprivileged LXC container, and install a small debian based image in it, make sure it can connect to the internet, AND gets its own IP on the local network (for sake of easy port-forwarding).

It would let you have a proper install that doesn't affect your host's configuration, and that you have absolute control over if needed.

Then follow the standard Linux CLI install.

When it comes to resources, my own full OS LXC container on proxmox, with the node running, and while the session is active, doesn't use more than 2.5gigs of storage space, and half of its assigned 128mb of ram. A bit storage heavy, but overall light to run.

If you wanna add a layer of security, possibly go into IPtables on your chromeOS/gentoo host and isolate it from the IPrange of your network, minus node's webui (port 4449), and minus gateway communications, but still blocking sensitive stuff like the gateway's webui and ports like 22/445/512.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Important note: If you already have a node running, having a second node on the same IP doesn't make any positive change, might even penalize you. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/svyahz/help_setting_node_up_on_chromebook/hxjjgmg/  Thought little more tip:

You should give 3gigs of storage space total to the LXC container.

Using a lean debian 11 image, the node install script would fail with a 2gig virtual drive, because while unpacking you go over that amount.

&#x200B;

If you encounter issues, or want more details about how I went about with my setup, you can find a long read about it on a previous post of mine where I encountered some miss-configurations during installation (and some weird behavior that really wasn't how things should go), how I did some firewall configuration ect [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/), or see [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/comment/hw8j91c/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) when with someone I went about firewall configuration for a docker install (which I haven't done myself, but wanted to know how I would go about doing it).

Keep in mind though, I'm not an expert, my word is as good as anyone else's, don't be afraid to do some of your own complementary research! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/svyahz/help_setting_node_up_on_chromebook/hxky47g/  Same, I think I had around 30 sessions from Benin, and my previous biggest client (\~24h/450GB) was from a Japanese IP. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxahqi5/  It seems they like to ping for uptime/latency, or that Netherland has a bigger community of dVPN clients. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxaho3y/  for just 2 weeks of running this node, if it keeps going at this rate every week a big client like that, I will fucking offset the powerdraw of my whole rack just with mysterium. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hx9htfa/  French residential IP, I don't mind answering, I have enough old comments in french speaking of stuff happening in France that I'm already country-doxed. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxaexc4/  https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/comment/hxaexc4/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/suacdz/a_new_big_client_who_decided_to_download_the/hxd6my2/  Hey hi, I followed your issue on their repo. Their actually-intended default configuration looks to be fine. Not the best, but clearly mindful.

I would guess what caused this behavior on my setup is somehow wireguard or myst didn't configured itself properly, or had issues interacting, fluke knows why, in my LXC container, even though the only modifications done to have the mysterium install script work was to spoof it to generic linux headers, fill in missing packets and add some gpg repo keys manually.

Something, between this or a quirk in the default debian11--container-image provided by proxmox might have borked something.

I solved the issue on my end, but I'll keep the firewall good-behavior cage around the container just for peace of mind and added layer of security.

So it might be specific to this kind of installation, but **if it can bork like** ***that*** **and this easily**, adding a way to review and modify the wireguard and firewall config (what parameters are to be applied to ephemeral wireguard interfaces) directly from the webui would allow plug&play-expecting beginners/neophytes to be warned about, troubleshoot and fix such issues, especially since not everyone would go from a clean install or strictly supported and tested distro/config.

Maybe a mindful feature to implement in the near future?

&#x200B;

Thank you u/Steccas for taking the time out of your day to file an issue and do the follow up on it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvon472/  Excuuuuse me chucklenut, even that's lot of word for ""TLDR+RTFM"", jimmies rustled it seems.

I expressly follow the native linux install guide, aka the **fucking manual**. I haven't touched how Mysterium configures wireguard by default.

(and I don't want to because I want that node to be 'set&forget', I don't want to do maintenance when whatever I would have done would have it break later if the myst-devs change something)

Had to just tweak the linux headers install process and patch in the missing packets (using snapshots to launch the install, get errored out, snapshot rollback, pre-install packets, not get errored out at the same step, rinse and repeat)

I'm just here venting the fact that the default install (aka, by the book) looks to have a concerning oversight in its configuration. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hveo6p9/  *\[ -using docker can let someone achieve even host isolation \]*

Such as LXC unpriviledged container too in my case. I commend mysterium's guide to at least advise beginners to create a sudoer user instead of running the node as root, but I was more worried about beginners/neophytes who would run their node bare-metal, like on a raspPi, or on an old spare laptop/computer... possibly with a slew of vulnerabilities, or worse even, with other services running on that same box that could badly interact and/or be exploited, **plus** the fact that in this case you can't firewall it *from outside* like a container without a proper firewall box plugged to it, where user-friendly market end users are more-often-than-not using their ISP's holly router as sole 'smart' network equipment. 

*\[Also, I think that better work to prevent bad traffic FROM the node can be taken.\]*

Yes indeed, for the proxmox firewall-ing of the container, I denied it all interaction (egress and ingress) with the full IP range used by hosts on the network(minus gateway), along with sensitive gateway ports like its webui for example, or ports that would allow to gather information on the maker/software of the gateway.

Exception made of needed things such as the node's webui, still reachable by a few select hosts.

Technically, the node's container could even be rooted that who ever is in it still couldn't touch the Lan.

Imo, and that's a very personal view on it, given **the stakes of running a wide open vpn node to a residential network**, Mysterium nodes should be advised to be used **only** in containerized form (docker/lxc/lxd) since they're aiming at and talking to a mainly beginner audience.  
\+ Docker or LXD(using snap) should let it run just fine on a raspPi, and without some of the risks.  
Distributing it as a ready-to-run container would also avoid any chance of fluke-miss-configuration upon installation.

\--------------

Concerning your contribution plans, DNS filtering yes yes, would be very welcomed, and god yes monitoring. Saw in the issue thread you were thinking of graphana integration as a possibility, that would be great!

Whenever you create your repo and push something you consider satisfactory or need people to beta-test, don't hesitate to ping me if you want me to add it to an edit at the top of the post for everyone to benefit from it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvoyhzr/  As you say, I know you're supposed to, at least for peace of mind.

But instead of just brut-blocking shit like a creature of habit keyboard facepalmer, I wanted to know what Mysterium's out-of-the-box experience was, and its behavior on an *almost typical residential network*. Observe the enemy.

Since this Dapp advertises itself as an user-friendly/**beginner-friendly** secure VPN, I took on myself to actually test its claims by following the install guide and **not** doing any extra *smart stuff* about it (aside from Proxmox-LXC image specific patching ups)

I allowed myself to see how Mysterium behaves out of the box in a controlled environment with solely already fairly hardened hosts on the network, all the hosts on that network have restrictive firewalls, SSL certificates with my own local CA, SSH keys, ect, and critical shit like IPMI interfaces or proxmox's datacenter access is segregated to an other network all together.

But the network I tested this on is managed by a residential off-the-shelf-from-my-ISP router with fairly standard config and features to the average consumer's.

And I came back to report on what I saw? To give a heads up to 'neophyte/beginner' node runners who may just have followed a tutorial to install it on a spare laptop or RaspPI they had lying around?

That maaaay be why my post is flaired as an alert, not a question. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hveszrn/  Mhm.

Basically if it was something that you know you have to do SOME config to selfhost, like a nginx+certbot reverseproxy&certification setup, it's assumed that you're gonna have to trust in the tutorial of whoever blogposter or content creator you learn from, and you know from the start that it will be a little journey and have to have security in mind.

But Mysterium presents itself as a set&forget for both node and client, and competing in the same space as centralized VPNs... not exactly the same ""targets"" obviously, the more curious-tinkerer ones, but ultimately its communication is leveled to speak to end users.

And I mean 'end-users', little to no skill/knowledge requirement announced.

And thus, the Node runner guide is roughly the same length as the DVPN user guide, in appearance thus ""as simple and straightforward"".

That's how it's 'marketed', by the Mysterium team as well as every content creator I saw talking about it.

Encouraging whoever will give them an ear to set up a node on a raspberrypi by just flashing and heading straight to the webui, no further configuration, or else to do it on a spare computer, spin up a fresh install of ubuntu or debian, install myst, jump to webui, no further configuration.

The section in which the guide actually talks about firewall and NAT is solely about troubleshooting an offline node... aka, tell you to punch holes, but not really anything about plugging up holes.

&#x200B;

I wouldn't say ""Mysterium bad"", because it's indeed the node runner's responsibility to secure their network, and to not install shit on it they can't control.

But share fault, because you wouldn't advertise a sport car as a ""beginner friendly"" car to a new driver on probation license, and *omit* to tell them it's delivered with ABS toggled off. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvh8m4r/  *\[How did you block the webui? A rule using the container ip/subnet itself? What about the container localhost?\]*  
*\[Wich rules did you use? You have some suggestions?\]*  


Concerning the webui specifically, I actually limited from the outside-container firewall's ingress to the 4449 container port with as sources specific network IPs, dropping every other source.  
I will admit I took no action to protect the node's webui from dVPNclients connecting to the node (which shouldn't be needed if the node's config is applied properly), but I'm not too worried about it:

* webui's password is 50+ characters long, and not reused anywhere else, as well is the root password of the unpriviledged LXC container, and as well is the sudoer user password.
* I'm not running a decentralized VPN node for profit, but by conviction. Nothing they could do in the webui could damage my network, worse case scenario they steal my MYSTT, which I don't care about.

&#x200B;

When it comes to the other firewall's rules, I did my firewalling specific to my setup, and I re-iterate, I'm not a security expert or an expert anything, my *suggestions* I would be more curious to see how much you'll roast my firewalling more than anything!

Second, keep in mind I did all that as a container's firewall, configured from the host, which is applied to the virtual NIC from the host perspective.  
Leaving the source IP blank on firewall egress on that NIC means it catches all potential IPs the node may use.

\-**Egress** \- default Output policy : **Accept**.

Let's start: first a few destination ports this node should never have to contact, who ever is using that through a VPN is clearly trying to poke around, **Reject** on all:

* 514 in udp (remote syslog)
* 445 in tcp (active directory and samba shares, previously also netbios on old windows versions)
* 135 tcp&udp (MS RPC)
* 137-139 tcp&udp (Netbios IP legacy)
* 161-162 udp (SNMP)
* I technically should (you should) block IRC ports (6660-6669 tcp) because a lot of botnet use them, but since I run my node per conviction of help to stop speech/info censorship, I want IRC chats to be reachable through it.

Then **Reject** egress by macro HTTPS and HTTP destined to the precise IPs (CIDR32) of all my subnet's gateways, to protect their web interfaces.

Then **Reject** all egress to an IPset that represents all the static IPs of all server hosts on the on all the subnets (by CIDR32)(multiple proxmox nodes, an unraid NAS) (redundant with the rule bellow, but eh, peace of mind for a moron)

Then an IPset that take each of my subnets IP ranges (CIDR24), minus the ones of the gateways (CIDR24), and **Reject** all egress to them.

\----------------  
Then we need to talk a bit of why my network is structured like shit:  
I'm on fiber (2Gbps down, 600mbps up)  
My ISP (which is the most stable in my location, hence why I'm with them) doesn't deliver a modem and a router. The router has an onboard integrated modem.  
Not an SFP+ slot, not a coax, not anything, I legit have single mode fiber cable between a wallplate and my internet box.  
If I wanted to use my own equipment, I would be a proprietary firmware ONT SFP+ hacking journey that, even successful, could fail any day without notice whenever my ISP change something on their side.  
Also, that shitty box doesn't support ANYTHING. No link aggregation/DACP/trunk, not multiple subnets, not ip ranges superior to /24, not VLANs, and ONLY has 4 1gbps ports.  
So I just threw together a small OPNsense box that manages 4 subnets (including the IPMI management one and the one dedicated to hosts administration like the ssh and webuis of proxmox and unraid), but the 'main' subnet is directly onto the ISP router... because my OPNsense box is a very low power salvage, and would struggle too much with the kind of throughput I have.

Hence why the last egress rules are very specific to my setup and dedicated to ""patch"" issues with that shitty router/gateway I'm stuck with, and not really relevant to list here, but if you're curious, here's a nice [example](https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2018-20377/) from one of the previous models from my ISP, hence my lack of trust.  
By default you can think about putting a **Reject** on all egress that would have gateways as destination on ports like 21 22 and 23 for example.  
Still, it's 'setup specific'! (I don't feel comfy sharing these to be honest, to not expose if I overlooked something important that could then be exploited!)  
\-------------

If I didn't had a brain-derp, it should allow the node wide access to the world wide web on most ports, minus ones that are in the non-sense category, while excluding all my subnets' hosts from being reachable, still worse case scenario allows to 'sense' my gateways but not know what maker/type they are.

&#x200B;

**Ingress** \- default Input policy: **Drop**

Then using an Alias that represent the ONLY allowed IP of the node on my network (thus excluding potential 'spawns' which would then default to drop all ingress), I defined these rules to that Alias:

**Accept** ingress on 4449 (webui) and 22 (SSH) from an IPset of specific (CIDR32) local ips

**Drop** a little list of outright all sources ingress, for peace of mind: 20,21,22,23,67,68,69,79,98,110,111,113,119, all sources. I'm almost sure I did a mistake in there, but so far people connecting to the node don't seem to have been to distraught about it, since I had clients with hour long sessions.

**Reject** on all port the IPset of all my subnets' on /24CIDRs minus the gateways (cleaner than drop for local network, that same rule is the default on all my hosts and their containers/VM, to reduce propagation risks from a compromised host to an other)

**Reject** a macro HTTPS/HTTP/LDAP ingress, because I don't want people to use it as a webhost (I'm selfhosting some stuff myself, that doesn't seem to be a good idea), denying LDAP is to avoid being used as a proxy for log4j exploits that use LDAP, but there is probably a lot more I could/should block

**Accept** on the ranges 10000:25560,25570:60000, to let clients connect to the node through the widest range of ports it uses and listens to.   
Only left a little space in the middle because I have friend's MC servers running.

That's about it, minus a few rules to no-log some stuff like the ISP router doing some multicast to 224.0.0.0/24,its-subnet/24, and pinging the shit out of everything.

To anyone reading, it's not advice, and I probably made a terrible mistake somewhere, don't copy, ask for an actual security expert, which I'm not.

&#x200B;

*\[In my case, I'm not going to run nodes in a home network/home lab environment, I'm not comfortable with that.\]*

Understandable!

*\[I'm running them hosting/vps etc.\]*

I considered it. Though often hosting/vps IPs are blocked by a lot of services (including streaming plateforms), but also are very susceptible to being blocked and/or monitored by countries/organizations which intend to censor and do speech/opposition repression, which kinda would defeat the point of why I run a node!

*\[I'm planning to use SWAG\]*

I already use SWAG to frontface some stuff to a cloudflare proxy, but I plan on switching to traefik for that too, which I already use internally for SSL for stuff that isn't publicly 'presented'.  
You could add a layer of auth (+ with 2fauth on top) using Authelia eventually.


[1/2] ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hw2bwil/  [2/2]

*\[For this in planning to: \[...\]\]*

That's indeed a whole stack! What could be a solution would be to produce a shell script that, in a standard LXC (or even baremetal) bog standard debian, would pull all the mysterium pihole suricata etc needed sources and automatize most of the config, only asking to input the parameters needed (like the static IP, subnetIPrange/CIDR, and gateway(s) to use for the stack on the actual local network) in order to make it as secure as it should be and as beginner friendly as it advertises itself to be.

As you saw, my setup is waaaaaay simpler than that, probably also way less informed, but in a situation were I don't care about the node's 'internal' security that much, more about it not touching anything in my turf and not being used 'too' maliciously.

&#x200B;

*\[In any case I thank you for the insights, the suggestions you're giving and for volunteering to help with the repo.\]*

My *'insights'* are more just remarks/conceptions of someone who has widespread but sparse understanding/knowledge, with a lot of holes.  
I saw stuff that seemed (almost instinctively) problematic, and while I can conceptualize solutions, building a whole stack (let alone automating it) that would both be completely securely tight AND plug&play is kinda beyond my skills.   
I see myself further in the category of code tinkerer than actual coder, more a security enthusiast and not at all an expert.

I will indeed check out the repo, probably try it myself, report on it, eventually point out issues if I see some, but I probably won't have a complete solution to anything!

Though as I said, as soon as you're comfortable enough with your repo, I'll link it at the top of the post in an edit, so more eyes are on it, and probably some from people who are more knowledgeable and crafty than myself!  


  
*\[Looking forward to read your opinions.\]*

Yup, well, indeed it was more opinions than solutions or even insights from my part.

Looking forward to see you roast my firewall rules ;) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hw2bzaz/  *\[To be honest you did a great job, I'd just add blocking of malformed IP packets and rate limits for SYN and ICMP packets.\]*

Showing how much I'm not an expert, I actually never tried to do that with Proxmox's firewall, I'll have to try that!

*\[Regarding traefik, I think it is way better to stand with nginx, and especially swag that has fail2ban integrated.\]*

Fair! I just found traefik a bit easier to play with, but that's entierely personal. It's more flexible when it comes to adding removing services on the fly, doesn't need reloads or rebuilds. Hence my choice for internal SSL!

I think it's just that failtoban looses a bit of its importance when I'm hiding with cloudflare's proxy, caching and filtering.  


*\[On the VPS vs ISP: I honestly think that they are still monitored in any case.\]*

Yeah ISPs are monitored like VPS are, but residential addresses are not as blocked as datacenter IPs from a country to an other, or by platforms that geoblock.

My node is thus still available to a wider audience, with access to a wider array of services than if it was running on a VPS I think.

Also I'm kinda serving my own ends by running a node, because my internet usage from my ISP's point of view becomes an indecipherable mess of a wide array of profiles and languages mixed together, basically stopping them from building a profile.

In that way, 'being a VPN' can protect your identity almost as much as using one.

&#x200B;

*\[wich DNS will be used by the VPN client\]*

I'm puzzled about it too.

But I would assume they are using the DNS they are configured with on their machine, since I haven't seen (or else missed it) custom DNS options in the VPN's code ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hwehrap/  1. no. I'm running mine in an LXC debian container with as available resources 10% of a single core of a 9th gen processor, and 128mb of ram. A session just finished at this moment after 23h58 with \~445GB transfered, and the node didn't even touched half its resources. It's not resource intensive at all.
2. yes. you will be better placed to have clients who will send/receive lots of data. 1GB earns you almost as much as 200hours of session. Ping can also matter to some clients.
3. Not on the same IP, I doubt it.
4. Yes. But better use IPs from different regions of the world than your neighbor's or grandma's, who ultimately have ""the same internet"" as you, same geo-locks/laws/censorships. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sojaqr/best_way_to_maximise_network_node_earnings/hw9hjua/  Not. They are most likely either watching ultra HD, or torrenting.

We passed the 100GB bar at the moment. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw5jr93/  **After** this amount of traffic? Well, the session is still going. 16th hour.

The node is indeed residential, but in a virtualized environment, with a firewall applying to it from outside its container.  
If you're curious about security, I had a [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/) where I had a configuration issue outside the box and quite a bit of discussion in the comments.

And since I'm not on whitelist, be conscious I may be taking a bit of a risk.

&#x200B;

Other than that, we are at 275GB on this session at the moment I'm writing, the container still doesn't use more resources, still at 62MiB of used memory. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw7pqfi/  I can't give you a straight answer, the previous ""long session"" I had was a 19hours long from Japan who transferred \~750mB, and I had a dozen of ""short sessions"" who did about 100 to 500mB.  
Key points:

\- I'm on a 2Gbps down 600mbps up connection

\- I have low ping

\- My node's self-test indicates it is 'Full cone', so I am as reachable as possible (while with docker container I could only achieve Symmetric Nat restricted cone, surely due to how my network and hosts are structured)

\- Clearly allocated resources don't matter. Allocated 10% of a single core of a 9th gen processor and 128mb of ram of RAM to the debian LXC container, the average use of these both was under half the total allocation for the whole 23h58 session, and the few CPU spikes weren't above 80-90%... so 8-9% of a 9th 35WTDP cpu.

&#x200B;

So I don't know how I attracted them, but I guess what made them stay was stability, throughput and ping? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hweiqdt/  Well, running myst bare metal is indeed more risky than running it in a container if anything goes wrong or miss-configured.

I will give you under what 'advices' I can, keep in mind I'm not a security expert, just a tinkerer, and I'm not above making mistakes when giving advices either, it's to give you a 'guideline' idea!

Taking a raspberry Pi as an example, given how little resources the node uses, it's a bit of a waste of a Pi to just run the node on it.

So the idea would be to have the Mysterium node running in docker and segregated from your other docker containers that you then could run on your PI, and also segregated from your network.

* Without going too deep into it, here's what my recommendations would be for a rasp-pi node:
* install bog-standard raspbian
* install docker
* go for a docker container installation of myst instead of bare metal.

It being in docker means you can also more easily set up firewall rules for the container outside of the container, which means that if anything goes wrong **within** the Mysterium container, in all logic it shouldn't be able to bypass your firewall rules or touch your host so long it's an unprivileged container.

The bare minimum rules to protect your network would be the following, assuming your IP range is 192.168.0.0/24 (aka 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.0.255, and your gateway(router) is 192.168.0.1):

Create a network bridge in docker that will let the container have its own IP:

    $docker network create -d macvlan --subnet 192.168.0.0/24 --ip-range 192.168.0.128/31 --gateway 192.168.0.1 -o parent=eth0 br0docker

(I leave it the possibility to take ip 192.168.0.128 or 192.168.0.129 to avoid possible conflicts, but you can reduce it to one with /32, or expend the range)

&#x200B;

Create an IPset that represents your local network, minus your gateway:

    $ipset create lan-gw hash:net comment
    $ipset add lan-gw 192.168.0.0/24 comment ""lan IP range""
    $ipset add lan-gw 192.168.0.1/32 nomatch comment ""gateway""

And one that represent the IPs your node may have:

    $ipset create mystip hash:net comment
    $ipset add mystip 192.168.0.128/31 comment ""mystip""

And one of the IPs on your lan that you want to allow accessing the node's webui:

    $ipset create mystwebui hash:net
    $ipset add mystwebui 192.168.0.24/32

In the example above, only the computer on your lan using the  192.168.1.24 will be able to reach the node's webui. You can add more if needed.

The following firewall rules would be a ""minimal"" security setup imo, to protect your other devices on the network and your router from the node, while still allowing it full connectivity over the dVPN ports, and a select webui access from your chosen device:

    $iptables -I INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -m set --match-set lan-gw src -p tcp --dport 4449 -j ACCEPT
    $iptables -A INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -m set --match-set lan-gw src -j REJECT
    $iptables -A INPUT -m set --match-set mystip dst -p udp --match multiport --dports 10000:25560,25570:60000 -j ACCEPT
    $iptables -I OUTPUT -m set --match-set mystip src -m set --match-set lan-gw dst -j DROP
    $iptables -I OUTPUT -m set --match-set mystip src -d 192.168.0.1 -p tcp --match multiport --dports 22,80,443 -j DROP 
    $iptables --policy INPUT DROP
    $/sbin/iptables-save > /etc/iptables/rules.v4

(I know -i ethX and other stuff could be used, but just trying to keep it setup-agnostic and simple, all setup change modifications would only require changes in IPset)

I advise you to read a bit about iptables and how docker can modify them, it's a headache but a necessary one.

Make sure your node always starts in docker with the following extra parameter so it gets its own IP, seperate from your Pi host, on your network for ease of portforwarding:

    $docker run --network br0docker .....

As for CLI into the container, use the docker CLI for that from your raspberryPI.

&#x200B;

I haven't done it myself so I can't tell you it's all good to go, but that would be my take on it in my head if I went to do it, if it can be of any help as a starting point.

(I run an LXC container on Proxmox instead, and even then my setup isn't perfect I'm sure). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw8j91c/  I repeat: I'm not a security expert nor anything, just a tinkerer. I might be wrong about some stuff, I may have made mistakes I'm not seeing.

Really the reason I made this answer it's less about giving you instructions to follow, more like giving you the idea/understanding of what we're trying to achieve to secure it, and the steps I imagine I would have to take to make it happen, using only tools that are well documented and recognized.

Again, I don't have a RaspPi atm, I haven't tried it on docker either.

I went for an LXC container so I could test the bare-metal native install in a containerized environment to have more control over it, reduce risks and monitor it, which achieves in essence the same concept of container+outer firewall.

Really the better advice if any that I can give you is to look and ask around, either here or on linux dedicated reddits about IPtables/IPset and Docker, and be curious to dive in documentation/tutorials made by people more knowledgeable and skilled than I am! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw8xmrz/  Well, two things:

1. you must have created the IPsets corresponding first. Ipset is a 'companion package' to iptables, be sure it's installed!
2. it's `--match-set` , two times  `-` , not `—match-set` ;)
3. wait, I fucked up some synthax, gimme a moment to edit -- edited, might not be above still having left an error in, but I just had a brain-blank about how to declare source and destination properly with match-sets. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hw98pkx/","Medical Doctor.

But these are balanced out by blocks with more leisurely schedules like Ancillary or Shelter Med. 

There are three big tips I have that can dictate how your 4th year will go:
1.) Be as efficient and proactive as you can during the day. If you can do this you can usually still leave each day at a decent time even on harder blocks.
2.) Be a helpful block mate and don’t dodge hard cases. Your classmates will notice this and will help you in return.
3.) Approach every situation with a positive growth mindset.

Maybe try working on your handling techniques as well if you’re frequently getting bit or scratched. Keep yourself safe and your patients unafraid! I’m a big fan of Fear Free methods. Half right. For a vaccinated person: They do 2 boosters if you’re bit by an animal with rabies or if it’s status is unknown. The immunoglobulin is not recommended for a vaccinated person and is unnecessary and potentially harmful. Honestly, seconding this. The medical terminology class I took back when I was still in high school carried me way farther than I would have expected. It’s the foundation of understanding anything in vet school. Plus, you look a lot better as a vet tech/assistant when you can spell and appropriately use med terms lol.I wasn’t able to find an actual job, but I also didn’t try because I knew it was just for a short time (one summer) and I was already working. I literally just called a private vet clinic and asked if I could come shadow for the summer. I essentially “worked” as a VA but for free (free labor for them lol) and shadowed the vet. Bonus is that they would’ve hired me on as a VA if I hadn’t gotten into vet school. I’d probably try calling instead of emailing, especially if you’re contacting smaller clinics. It just seems to get better responses. ","Veterinarian or Veterinary Assistant. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian or Veterinary Assistant"" because it discusses veter",Veterinarian

SnoopThereItIs88,"As a tech, I would NEVER speak to a vet like that or anyone in general. How awful. And how awful to treat a new tech like that too. What miserable people. 


I would absolutely be bringing that up to their immediate supervisor or practice manager. That's so inappropriate and rude. They're the ones who should be finding new jobs, not you. If we ever spoke to someone like that, it would be a one way road to a write up, pending suspension or worse if they're repeat offenders. 


As a side note: saying you ""don't do emergencies"" is room for growth. When I worked GP if one of our vets said that, they wouldn't be welcomed back because that's part of your job. I wouldn't give them any more ammo to be assholes.Seconding this option! We don't have the ability to install a scavenger. So we bought 3M half face respirators, with either the pink or gray cartridges. The pink covers more than the gray (organic vapors only). No, we have those. I meant the out of building units. We USED to have one of those but swapped buildings and no longer do.


Edit: I work in research, we have chambers we use and the f/air doesn't catch that gas. Even when I worked GP, we still used masks with the canisters. Lol, thanks for the concern, but no. We have what we're supposed to have. I'm just lamenting the loss of our cool unit. 


We wear masks and use the canisters. Osha may not have a limit on how much iso I breathe in, but my poor little ovaries do. So I choose to sound like Darth Vader's little sister.Research vets literally do everything from high tech sx to monitoring IACUC protocols and behavioral programs. I've worked with so many who do different things, it's really dependent on where you're employed. Never have we ever said that research vets aren't real DVMs because you are. Some of our studies have been approved or rejected based off y'alls decision. 


One of my favorite things one of my vets showed me was how to do a csf draw in a small animal (research, not GP). Another one told a shit PI to pack sand for trying to weasel a bullshit procedure through without an IACUC approval. 


Y'all have a lot of talent and power. Don't let anyone tear you down. Research and some specialized hospitals. I make a living wage in research that I could never have in general practice. During COVID, I almost cleared 90k working in a high containment facility. Without that hazard pay, I make close to 70k. 

I don't have my tech degree, but I have 13+ years of experience in various vet med industries. I have degrees, just not job related ones, haha.Sure! I work primarily in vaccine research as a vet tech. We perform many similar procedures as GP techs do- blood draws, anesthesia monitoring, health support, etc. and some of us perform actual study procedures. 

There are many different employers for research vet med. Some people choose to go Army and work in the military, others are contractors for the military/gov/academia, and the rest of us work for private companies called Contract Research Organizations. 

I started as an animal caretaker and moved up to my vet tech position. 

The Laboratory Animal Technician certificate is what I found to be the best if you're already a vet tech. It covers AVMA rules, standards of care via APHIS/USDA/etc. and also covers a lot of what would be considered exotic med (because we work with non-traditional animals a lot).

GP drained my patience, but I love vet med, so I went research. I've gotten to work with a lot of different species and learn a ton of different procedures (like a survival CSF draw on something smaller than a cat).

Edit: word.You're welcome!I make ""ugly things"" that stand out. I attach a zip tie to markers with the room label or write in bold letters on the thermometers where they live. At least then if they get poached, you can return them to their proper living quarters.You know that ""DVM"" stands for Doctor of Veterinary MEDICINE, right? 

Capability does not equate motivation. You can be capable of studying and achieving a degree, but if you're not motivated, you're just making yourself miserable.

Embarrassed_Exit9831,"Thanks! It should be about an 8 hour surgery day. 
Yes the 501c3 is in the works. 
I’m doubtful we’ll be able to hire a full-time veterinarian. There are neighboring counties that are all incredibly short staffed that are not able to hire DVM’s or tech. They also pay less than the rates I’ve stated above, but I still want to be competitive since I’ll be recruiting from the surrounding cities (5-6 hours away)
I’m hoping that it will be possible to get full time staff once we are established.Yes that’s definitely a concern. The point is that it’s unlikely we’ll be able to hire a full time Vet- so if we can staff it with relief/ contract vets it might be more successful. Most of the human medical clinics in the area do that because there are so few providers.
I have 4 DVM’s who are interested in working here on a rotating basis. It’s a very desirable area to visit, close to a national monument and national parks, it’s becoming a more popular tourist destination so that’s why I’m hoping the travel stipend and the lodging for the weekend would be an incentive. I’m also planning to offer a night or two on the shoulders of the clinic days so they can stay longer and actually enjoy the area and not just be working. Do you have any feedback on the per diem rates that I stated above?Thanks! 
I plan to verify income based on the most recent paystub. It’s a seasonal tourist community so people’s incomes fluctuate a lot. 
We’ll have at least one DVM who will approve all the SOP’s and one CVT on the board of directors. I’ll be the only full time staff member initially with a part time administrative assistant. We’ll be in charge of ordering, inventory, record keeping, maintenance etc. The plan would be to hire another full time CVT after the first year. Our focus will be S/N wellness, vaccines. I’ll also collaborate with the DVM’s in neighboring communities for referrals for any illnesses or serious accidents. I’m hoping some of the revenue can go into an Angel fund that can support people in getting their pet to a regular vet for those types of things. It’s a small community, lot of people here can’t afford to drive that far, may not even have a car that can make it over a mountain pass, etc.Yeah I’m concerned about not being able to generate enough revenue from services to cover a full-time vet. I’m planning on doing a survey to gather data on household income, how many pets per household, and affordability of services. My tentative plan for pricing is to offer free or 5 dollar vaccines for the lowest income bracket. If we do it that way there’s a good chance we can get grants to cover the vaccine cost to the clinic. $for staffing is my biggest hurdle right now. According to county data the average household makes between 40k-60k per year but it’s hard to predict what the average person can afford because there’s a huge wealth gap.That’s how I’d like to start our clinic too. Similar to what I’ve done in HVSN with very basic wellness services. I’ve been told by friends that in this part of the country the average rate for a relief DVM is 85-100 an hour. That’s why I was thinking $750 for an 8 hour day. It’ll be easier to budget for set per diem rates rather than pay per hour. But I think it’s possible to bump it to $850 per day, the travel stipend will be coming from different funding. (We’re applying for a lot of different grants, plus hoping to get a decent amount of private donations, and in-kind donations for equipment and supplies at least for the first year) then figuring out if we can sustain it just off of donations for services.Also a concern I have (like you mentioned) is getting experienced DVMs who have the ability to do a high volume of surgeries per day. It seems like the organizations I’ve worked for who do HVSN don’t have a hard time recruiting vets at lower rates but that’s been mostly on reservation areas.","Veterinarian.

galactose,"Shit happens and things die even when you do everything right. 

When I was in my first year of vet school, one of my professors said “things will die, no matter what you do. And things will also survive no matter what you do. Try not to take yourself so seriously “, and that statement has helped me a lot.

Being responsible for the death of a pet isn’t a matter of “if”, it’s a matter of “when”. You just need to take comfort in knowing that you did your best, and that you will help more animals than you hurt in the long run. I lost a pet under anesthetic a few weeks ago, and it was completely unexpected. I felt really sad afterwards, but then I moved on so that I could be in a good place to help other pets. You can’t carry that shit around with you or it will literally kill you. It wasn’t the first time and it won’t be the last, unfortunately. 
Strong and healthy coping mechanisms are a must in this profession.I’m an SGU 2015 grad. I had a wonderful vet school experience in Grenada but definitely think it’s not for everyone. 

Quality of education was excellent, lots more surgical experience than my mainland trained colleagues after graduation, and no issues with licensing or “island school stigma” after finishing.

It takes someone very passionate about what they do to be successful in those settings and if you don’t pay them a living wage, then I would probably cut and run too.
Same thing with faculty - academic wages are typically miles behind private practice with an ever increasing workload bw clinics, research, teaching, department management - so people end up forced into positions that take up more time and effort, and some days there’s just not enough in the tank to trickle down to your house officers let alone students. And with the relative exodus into private sector it gets worse and worse…. Not to mention the RED TAPE of an academic institution…..Yes you can - surgeon here - you are going to have a challenging time on hospital surgery rotations like ortho/ soft tissue which will not be able to accommodate your table height, since it will be faculty behind the wheel most of the time.

DisheveledDr,"I didn’t go to Purdue but experienced similar things at my school. I was just thinking this morning how it has taken me since graduating (May 2023) to actually feel normal again. Downtime no longer stresses me out. I’m finally relaxing on days off. But it took too long to stop the habits and toxic feelings I had from school.

On another note, this morning is a rainy lazy day in the clinic and I am busy sewing catnip bags to give away to clients and making a presentation on how to read ear cytology for our new assistants while some of my favorite clients pop in just to say hi and I wish the me of two years ago crying in the school bathroom after a bad day on surgery or after I failed the NAVLE could see me now. It gets SO MUCH BETTER.1) for me it was almost impossible without having the body in front of me
2) don’t stress too much now. Try to take an anatomy or biology class that allows dissection and work on it a bit then (my zoology class had more dissection than anatomy) but you will also most likely spend your first year of vet school drowning in anatomy too, no need to know it all (or even most) right now.
3) anatomy coloring books can be helpful to some people. I’m artistic so I hand drew things in different colored pens and that worked better for me - too easy to zone out while coloring.I had at least five offers when graduating (class of 2023) and I honestly didn’t look. I was offered a position everywhere I visited/did externships and I already knew a lot of people in the field from my four years as a tech who also extended offers. I started receiving offers in my first year and had a few classmates that had signed by second year (I waited till the end of fourth to decide).

FairEmphasis,"This is my biggest sticking point for corporate medicine. My boss wants to have a video chat once weekly that I just say I’m too busy for half the time and I barely have to interact. Meanwhile, the privately owned practice I worked in previously had the owner entering the exam room to question doctors in front of clients all the time and then would want to be joking around afterward. Are ya kidding?  

The non-veterinarian behind a desk in a different state setting my expected patients/surgeries per day is annoying, but the day to day is so much better. It’s maybe more soulless, but until I feel like opening my own, it’s either corporate or relief for me.I guess a question I’d ask is, why can’t you afford a $120k salary on the east coast in a HCOL area? A doctor working ~40hr in a HCOL should be making plenty to warrant their salary unless you don’t have enough appointments to facilitate that? In which case you’re not ready for another doctor anyway.If I’d have to put money down, I’d have to bet that it was either someone in SA community practice or someone in ECC that made the posture comment?If it makes you feel any better, almost every vet I’ve spoken with has this experience no matter the school they went to. And I went to Purdue and didn’t think the experience was as bad as described. It’s absolute dog shit, almost every rotation has a few bad eggs with some have nearly all, but that’s also life a lot of the time. I found it easier to bond with the residents (regardless of age) who would then make the grading a hell of a lot easier. I never got any criticism that wasn’t legit or that I at least could look at and say, “well yeah, I’m still learning”. 

Just be prepared to be labeled a Rossie by the students until “proven otherwise”. People can be hypercritical until they realize every cohort has their strong and weak students; as long as you’re not a bum, you’ll kill it. Don’t fret the next two months.As far as I’ve read, recent studies show no association with FISS with the current Imrab rabies vaccine. I have the same concern in the back of my mind with it, but evidence based medicine is the standard.Hey, as a more recent grad, I’ll share my experience. We had the same people come to us saying the same things about not making production your first year. 

I worked at a busy (not kinda busy, not very busy, just normal busy) 4 Doctor GP practice and worked about 40hr/wk. Decent split between wellness and sick visits, solid number of surgeries, etc. I didn’t make production my first month due to doing all sorts of admin stuff, occasional shadowing in the first two weeks, etc. I made production every other month from then onward. 

It truly will depend on where you end up working - if you’re in a MCOL city and above, you’ll absolutely make production. I have a few friends from school that did have some negative accrual, but they worked in more LCOL areas (think middle of the country). 

As much as money is important, I wouldn’t stress too much about the production aspect. Ask for 20% because it’s standard and be done with it. Negotiate for the highest salary you can and remember that you’re in charge - there’s a vet shortage that gives you *much* more negotiation power. Being a new grad lowers that obviously. However what you should push for in terms of salary varies widely on where you live. Out of school in a MCOL I got $100,000/yr in salary. 

Also try to get any sign on bonus you can and push for it to be for only ONE year. Definitely not 3.Spays are the worst surgery no matter how deep into the profession you are. I still very much hate them to this day. You should not feel incompetent. 

We also all make mistakes. Just today I diagnosed atresia ani on the kitten’s SECOND visit to me. I think back about how I should’ve been paying attention to the fact there was no rectum (the patient had a rectovaginal fistula so I initially thought the vagina was the rectum and wasn’t thinking to look at a vagina at all - always do a full PE). It sucks but I learned. 

I struggled hard for the first few months/year(s) in separating my work from my life outside of work. It’s a good idea to set time aside like you’ve said for continued learning outside of the pressure of appointments but also remember you’re more than a veterinarian and *should* be more than a veterinarian. You will grow even faster if you’re mentally well rested. Find ways to disconnect. It won’t always be perfect, I can still have a weekend ruined by overthinking on cases. But I’m so much less anxious when I’m not thinking about it at all. 

You’ve got classic imposter syndrome to a degree like everyone else who just graduated. And to some extent, there IS a ton of stuff you don’t know. But you made it through vet school which means I know you’re more than capable of picking things up quick. Keep caring for your patients as much as you can and good luck to you!","Veterinarian.

Accomplished_Coat231,"You can either take the shadowing route described by the previous poster, apply as an assistant if you do see a job open up that doesn't require experience (sometimes places like Banfield will train someone from square one), or do what I did and volunteer at an animal shelter to build up some animal experience to list on your application.Oh, or most clinics will hire kennel assistants without experience. Then at least you'd be getting paid. Once you prove yourself to be a good employee, you can see about transferring to the assistant position.They're going to want to see evidence that you are reliable (show up on time? not call out for frivolous reasons?), have good common sense, and plan to stick around for a while. They're not going to want to invest time training someone then have them quit a week or two later once they learn that kennels are noisy and there's lots of poop to clean up.

To prepare, think of a few examples of times in the past where you've demonstrated responsibility, stuck with something despite periods of difficulty, or shown good observational skills that helped prevent a problem.

Finally, there's Storj. You will need a large hard drive, like at least 2 terabytes, to make anything substantial, but essentially you're renting your drives and getting paid to help host a decentralized cloud storage service. More info on that here, which should include a Pi setup guide: https://www.storj.io/node ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11zmvfy/what_other_similarfun_projects_do_you_run/jddebhk/  Glad to help and thank you too! If I remember right on Honeygain, Pawns and Bitping, I did something special to each that's a little different from their Pi instructions.

-Pawns works on Pi specifically by having Docker installed on it (they have an ARM variant of the container) I'd have to check what I changed on the Docker command, but I made it start detached I think.

-Bitping doesn't need Docker, but since I was doing it on a headless Pi, I installed Screen first, then started a new Screen session via SSH before executing the command to start the Bitping node. This lets you disconnect while it keeps running.

-Honeygain will work on Pis if you run it with an Android image on an SD card. Install Vysor and you can remote access it, allowing you to run headless and still see the Android GUI.

-EarnApp is a one time setup and doesn't need any additional work. It can run simultaneously alongside the others or Docker!

If I had to guess regarding your previous storage node, it might have been Filecoin? That was the similar project I knew about at least.

Also, all of these projects also have Windows, Linux and regular Docker variants if that's more your thing! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11zmvfy/what_other_similarfun_projects_do_you_run/jdgbqoc/  Weird that there might have been another storage project like these two, but you're probably right that it's gone by now.  


I didn't include Filecoin because personally, I haven't tried it myself to confirm whether it's a project where you'll ever see a return like the others. It's definitely a legitimate project, but it has much higher barriers to entry than Storj does for node contributors. Filecoin's [node setup site](https://sp.filecoin.io/) says that you're required to provide a minimum of 10 terabytes, while Storj will let you start with as little as 500 gigs.  


Another one that I forgot was Chia, but it's not a cloud storage project like the other two. This one also requires huge storage drives, but rather than renting them out, Chia uses them as ""plots,"" which I think is their version of mining. It can apparently be destructive to drives and I couldn't even get it working when I tried it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11zmvfy/what_other_similarfun_projects_do_you_run/jdskgy6/  There is a Raspberry Pi 3 clone (actually slightly more powerful than it, somewhere in between a 3 and a 4) called Le Potato. It mirrors the Rpi 3 schematic, so you can use Pi cases on it or put it in a Pi cluster rack, and I think it supports similar variants of Linux.

TekelTroubadour,"First off, I am sorry that you’re dealing with this sort of treatment at work. I’m sure it is very frustrating and will eventually lead to resentment and more negativity about your work environment. 

I can share my experience as someone who worked in the veterinary industry for over a decade. I worked at a couple of small animal practices, then large animal, and, eventually, emergency medicine during college to even out my resume for a potential vet school application. All of these clinics taught me different things, but the emergency clinic probably expanded my knowledge and experience the most due to the nature of the things being treated and fast paced environment. Ironically, the ER was also the final piece of the puzzle that led me to realize attending vet school would not be in my best interest long term. 

I should note that during my time in undergrad, I saw many of my piers (from shared classes and major) get accepted to vet school, attend, and eventually graduate and practice. So, I am aware of their experiences as new grads, and a lot of their initial success as vets depended on where they were hired. There is a vast scale of the perceived respect given to new grads that varies from a vet going back to work at a clinic they may have previously been employed at where they are known/their work ethic is understood, versus, say, someone going into large animal medicine without any experience working with farm animals until vet school. There is a certain period of time that will vary among both individual practices and specialty in which the new grad is expected to show a certain amount of reverence towards the other doctors (and even experienced techs) because they are still considered to be in a learning phase of how to transition from student to practicing doctor. 

This is not to say that you shouldn’t be respected in your own right for your accomplishments as well as knowledge and experience. As many others have pointed out, the tech refusing to use your doctor prefix is in the wrong, and you should address this with them directly or through management channels. 

Unfortunately, there can be stigmas in the industry related to age and gender. Despite being a female dominated field, there can be misogyny even among women with the misconception that a female doctor has to work harder to gain the same respect that a male counterpart (equal in every way) gets by default. This disparity can also be seen in a young new grad that is working with techs that may be older or have more time spent in the industry. This could be something at play with the tech that won’t refer to you as “Doctor —“. This doesn’t excuse their behavior, but it can be difficult for some people to use titles of authority with people that are younger than them.Continued…

When I graduated college, I took a job at a clinic that I had previously worked for while I was interviewing for other positions/career paths. I experienced two new graduate veterinary hires during that time that were very different, and their experiences as new grad hires differed too. One hire was very close to my age at the time (maybe mid-late twenties to early thirties), but she did not have very much practical experience. She even shared that she had taken an additional externship after graduation to get more hands on experience practicing medicine before feeling comfortable applying for a traditional job. There were clients that didn’t want to see her because of her age, and there were clients that didn’t care and ended up exclusively requesting her because they liked her personality and how she explained things. Originally, she only worked when another vet would be there too, but eventually the schedule didn’t always allow this, so she was scheduled with at least two experienced techs. Sometimes I was one of those techs, and, when working with her, it was clear that she second guessed herself a lot and only felt comfortable talking to clients after consulting her books or other resources. There were a few emergency type cases that came through during this time which I felt confident in diagnosing from seeing the same things in ER practice, and so I suggested she start with a certain diagnostic test or initial stabilization techniques. In this case, she did not like suggestions coming from someone who did not have a DVM, and we ended up losing a patient due to time lost from her consulting resources. This caused me and a few other techs to lose respect for this doctor because it was clear she did not value us. We all stayed respectful and continued to offer help and suggestions to her, but ultimately she left the position because she felt the work environment was hostile, though none of us ever tried to do anything but assist. 

The other new graduate was older and had gone back to school after an initial career and raising her family. She had some of the same issues of needing to double check her work, but the clients all assumed she had been in the field for some time due to her age. She accepted a lot more help from technicians and other doctors, and seemed to have a stronger start to her career.

No one should be questioning whether you are “worthy” of your doctor title, but to say that there won’t be some sort of questioning of your abilities for a while would be misleading. You aren’t incompetent, and admitting you still have things to learn shows that your ego isn’t too big, so it sounds like your best bet would be addressing things you dislike as they occur—either in the moment or later in the day/week if the time/place isn’t appropriate. You could demonstrate how you were taught to do something, while asking the techs if they have a better technique or suggestion for you, regardless if you’ll use it or not. Sometimes, “killing them with kindness” can be a useful approach since it seems like you’re only having an issue with half of the techs. Things do tend to improve with time, but acknowledging you’re in a “proving ground” time period will help with rationalizing things. Many people go into vet med because they love animals and that doesn’t always translate to being very good with people. You should definitely bring your concerns to management if things continue excessively or get worse. Reemphasize that you are learning, but the constant nit-picking/questioning of you has become detrimental to performing your job smoothly is one way of phrasing things.

Thanks to any that read all the way through! All of my piers that attended vet school and experienced similar new grad inferiority complexes are doing well and practicing successfully now. Most would admit there was a “hazing” like period where they had to prove worth to certain technicians, doctors, or staff, but this usually didn’t extend to the owner/vet that hired them. Toxic practice managers that don’t take concerns or complaints seriously, offer practical solutions, or that won’t go to bat for their workers will always be red flags. Bad managers are almost always a sign that a particular clinic/hospital won’t be a good fit, and having a good fit while you’re learning the ropes is super important! Yes, being able to pay your bills is important too, but don’t feel bad for trying to find a new job if it becomes clear the clinic you’re at will not be a good fit for long. Remember that all clinics can have bad actors, and the industry can be incredible cliquish, but you are worthy of respect and the doctor title that you earned! Best of luck in your endeavors and new career!I find the seasoned techs are much more eager to help teach what they have learned, especially when asked questions, than having their experience taken for granted—which can happen when working with vets of any and all experience levels! They are also more likely to recognize where you may not have certain experience versus just thinking you know nothing. Try not to project that everyone is thinking or feeling the same way because of the actions of a few techs. The confidence will definitely come with plenty of practice too! Consulting the books when you want to be sure is not a bad thing, and if you’re concerned about a client’s opinion you can always suggest that you just came across an updated journal or study on the topic at hand and that you’d like to double check that y’all are proceeding with the best treatment/diagnosis/understanding/etc. Most owners would rather you double check and reassure them than proceed without the confidence (that will come).","Other.

Hangry_Torbie,"Absolutely not. Might be an unpopular opinion but the sooner you are a vet, the sooner you can start paying off student loans. One of my friends from undergrad went straight to SGU and absolutely loved it. Her mom was also an alumni of the medical school there so she knew she wanted to go there. Plus I see your point of not having to deal with all of the rejection and whatnot from 10 or so US schools. I like that at the island schools you do your clinical year at a US school versus the newer schools like LMU, LIU, and Western you have to make a clinical year schedule entirely of private practices and such.Good to know!If they make another snarky comment, say “are you trying to be helpful or hurtful?” But follow what everyone else has said. You don’t deserve to be treated like you are.All I know is that the one radiologist we have at my vet school makes more money than our Dean, so it’s definitely a great paying job once you get board certifiedThere’s always public service loan forgiveness for loans. Since you seem passionate about a low cost spay and neuter clinic that would help with loans after 10 yearsYou know this actually makes me wonder about the Banfield mentor I had this summer for the student job program. She had a meeting with the area chief vet and came out clearly obvious she had been crying and then I think the next day or so she said she was going to change to one day a week in September. Then not terribly long after I had gone back to school it seemed like she got a new job at the shelter up the street based off facebook. I wonder if she there was something up with her performance metrics. She graduated in Jan 2021I found “Becoming a Millennial Veterinarian” by Ashley Grey very nice. I got it as a gift from an older classmate. It’s on amazon for $25[from a NAVLE prep FB group](https://www.vinted.co.uk/items/4002549496-navle-disease-template-digital-copy?fbclid=IwAR1xywsi6r5QTRhVoqaotaqzLggPgqiNPiodvN0GMFDdLSXs1LB1lUmxyFI_aem_AdS2vFZLppqcJrO1kt39Iym3EeqrhD9mnfljBwM13FFyxBrIDke2ofd_3VrZyraQddo) These study notes were shared for purchase on a Facebook group I’m a part of. They’re about $24. When I was trying to get to the page to link this for you I was confused by the pop-up to select country but if you just click the X instead of choosing it will get you to the study guides[etsy study pages](https://vetmedexplained.etsy.com) this is a different set also on that group. Was trying to find it earlier and finally saw it this time 

Ok when you click the other link, click on view sold item. It says the item was sold so you might have to message the seller to be able to get the guidesGreat! If you think they were worth it come April, can you send me a message (if you remember, no worries if not)? I don’t take the NAVLE until Nov/Dec for the first time

Edit: grammar fixWooo! Thanks for all of the great info!!! I won’t be taking the NAVLE until the upcoming Nov-Dec window, but I was just curious about the accommodations and how far advance should I be beginning to do the paperwork, forms, documentation or whatever to make sure I get the extra time when I sit for the exam?Thanks so much! I had briefly looked into it before but it is a lot more than I expected so I’ll definitely begin working on that packet as early as I canI plan on applying for a shelter medicine internship for right outside of school mostly because I am worried I might not find good mentorship easily right off the bat in a shelter. You can create a VIRMP account and look at the different programs right now since the application window is open for another couple months.SAVMA symposium was super fun because of the networking and the wetlab I did there was my first exposure to teeth extraction which was fun to learn and gave me an advantage when our class did them next semester.

When it comes to making friends, don’t spread yourself too thin trying to get to know everyone super well, but find a good circle without drama and who you can count on for school and *some* personal stuff.

Try to find ways to get surgical experience early on. I did my first canine neuter with RAVS and it was really cool experience. My first cat neuter experience came from a club. I didn’t get much spay experience beyond a little bit during my RAVS trip but I wished I had sought to work with more vets during breaks who would’ve let me do parts of the surgery instead of watching.

But also definitely just be excited about learning in general, there’s so many cool opportunities to do so during vet school!","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it discusses various aspects of veterinary practice, including",Veterinarian

Celuthien39,"I'm knee-deep in research about the profession myself and what I've found some other people say:

* Familiarise yourself with medical terminology (specifically Greek and Latin prefixes and suffixes)
* Having a working understanding of Math and Physical Sciences (Physics and Chemistry)
* Familiarise yourself with animal anatomy

There are a couple channels on Youtube I've really been enjoying, namely [YourVetAmanda](https://www.youtube.com/@yourvetamanda) and [May Yean](https://www.youtube.com/@MayYean).

But as ShowsTeeth has said, it's very difficult to get into vet school without prior exposure.

I tried logging onto my works wifi today under mysterium VPN (just in case) lol but they changed the password, if I can, it would be good to put nodes in factory. My job has 4 different wifi signals in the building lol I can do a LOT with just one ip address (mysterium being one thing, others to add too).

Due to me having so many internet scrapers, as soon as I turn on mysterium DVPN, they all shut down (selling my un-used internet bandwidth, I'm optimizing that set up for a few weeks now... its all working and banking well.. and like everything else you can set up various nodes in various locations/ip addresses to scrape internet to sell lol even with using raspberry pies, they can be used to sell internet connections too. Very discreet..... It's like mining all on its own, they even pay out in a variety of crypto or just PayPal if you like. I have 9 of those things between my main laptop and daily driver cellphone.

dinkiedinkie,"I can't offer much advice on how to get into vet school as it has already changed a bit since I graduated 6-7 yrs ago.  I will say from what I've gathered from the pre-vet and vet students I've mentored over the past few years, schools have gotten increasingly more strict about GPA cutoffs. When I was applying, Davis (my undergrad alma mater) was already implementing automatic cutoffs for students whose GPAs were less than 3.5.  It was the first school to reject me and it felt almost instantaneous :(

I got into Western (Pomona) on my first try at age 23 and at the time, they were fairly non-traditional and were very much more interested in admitting students with a variety of experiences. Age discrimination was definitely not a thing, my classmates' ages ranged from 21 to 48. I can safely say that my GPA was not the deciding factor for my admittance, they were way more interested in my research experience and I'm confident that was why they accepted me. My GPA when I applied was only 3.3.  This was in 2013 though and I know Western has only gotten more strict about their GPA reqs as well and prefer students with a minimum of 3.5 now.","Veterinarian.

HatExpensive2537,"This is a fine workaround until it can get fixed. We don't know what end is leaking. If the female end is leaking (and they don't need this drop) they could disconnect the drop entirely. But this is fine, you see all kinds of crazy things the are cobbled together in Vet med.How would that happen? The flowmeter takes it from 50psi (or whatever the Central system is set at) down to 0-4L/min. The only thing this will do if it came undone is to blow out oxygen from the quick connect fitting, thus wasting oxygen. Unless the anesthesia machine itself had a leak in the high pressure system, and the pop off was closed, and no one did a pressure test, and no one was watching the patient... this would not cause barotrauma.

Altruistic_Usual5364,"Hi I’m studying to be a vet but was an intensive care paramedic prior to starting this adventure. All I can really say is when I was a practicing paramedic, aside from “CPR” I was close to nothing without my tools. In rendering first aid at an accident, the list of things I can do with my bare hands include keeping the airway open, keeping their head immobilized to protect C-spine until an ambulance and/or firetruck arrived, and worst case scenario (aside from CPR of course), putting pressure on a deadly bleed. Other than that, the medicine that you’ve learned and know is pretty unhelpful as you’re not trained in the dynamics of vehicular accidents. I’ve had human doctors and nurses that are downright scary to have on scene because they think a car accident runs like the trauma room in a nice clean hospital, so don’t be that guy/gal. Stick to the basics, call 911, and sometimes the best medicine is just talking to someone while waiting for emergency services to roll up. Hope this advice makes sense 👍","Other.

BatInternational1548,"I am a certified hospice and palliative care veterinarian and it is a wonderful field where we can do so much good for pets and their families. It does require a certain type of person, especially in regard to communication skills but also some technical skills as most solo practitioners in this space work without technicians and on very sick pets that may not have good circulation. Feel free to DM me if you have specific questions.This is a common misconception. Hospice care just means your treatment goals change from pursuing a cure to pursuing comfort and quality of life - whatever that means for the specific pet and the family (usually aggressive symptom management but also home modifications and other things). Hospice care guidelines state it is our duty as veterinarians to provide this service when it is warranted or refer to someone who can.I guess I would also add, don't worry too much about specializing at this point. If you get into vet school you'll be exposed to lots of different avenues and your interests may change. If you still want to do it at that point, you can customize your internships to get experience and confirm it's what you want to do.That's fair. It's a subset of end of life patients so having a hospice service does usually mean you're also euthanizing once it gets to that point.","Veterinarian.

kansasmanansas,"I would argue that newer vets might be really great for your practice because they will gain technical skills and work up cases thoroughly a lot faster than they might in a practice that refers a lot out.I’m a leftie and initially I found the leftie instruments to be a lot more comfortable. Now, however, I do some shifts at a shelter and do upwards of 20 surgeries a day. There’s no way I can expect leftie instruments there, and I’ve gotten so used to standard instruments that it doesn’t make a difference  any more. One thing I’ve noticed is that as long as the scissors are sharp, they work fine. Once they dull, they are impossible to use as a leftie. Good luck to you!","Veterinarian.

BlushingBeetles,"my favorite part of new vets is when they ask our opinion! especially in multidoctor GP scenarios, we may have seen the patient/situation more than you in practice, and that’s okay! 

for instance everyone knows hyperthyroid cats have increased hunger, but i have almost never been wrong when i say that “ravenous = hyperthyroid cat”. when i told my vet she added it to her sick cat screening questions to determine if t4 was suggested or very necessary (low income area where $50 makes a difference).My fellow VAs would LOVE a big chore chart with stickers. I think it’s up to the vibe of the place though. You could always assign tasks to individuals based on what staff prefer doing (i love to clean microscope!!). People tend to take more pride in their work when they know they will receive credit and be rewarded for it!I’m embarrassed how often i base things off of chatgpt, I built my entire “i know we’re running late but please shut the fuck up” interaction off of it","Veterinarian.

Waamb,"Many places have unspoken rules. Maybe they are still getting to know you. Maybe there is silly background stuff that has nothing to do with you. Maybe when they get bit, they don’t report it, so they are avoiding paperwork by preventing you from getting bit. Detective it out or just frankly talk with a supervisor. 

It sounds like much more gabapentin needs to flow through your shelter though 😆. I know vaccines have to get in and intake needs to be done but a bowl of wet food and 100 mg of gaba will cut those scratches and bites in half.I used to help with the great ape heart project and the zoo vets frequently used human cardiologists and ultrasongraphers. Anatomically, apes are basically humans.That practice shouldn’t take new vets if the whole staff isn’t on board. If you like the place, I would talk to the practice owner. They just got you through your first 8 months, so that investment in your learning is paying off now. If staff don’t improve, then walk. They can get another new grad until they learn what it means to take on a new doctor. You also know their true nature, so you might also just want to get a new job. There are so many places that would want a vet at your level of development, plus you can start fresh with a new team.I don’t know what life stage you are in but research would allow that. You would need to go back for a PhD or MPH and getting those jobs requires diligence. 

You could also start looking at different industry sectors and see if an additional bachelors would help you. With an MBA or computer programming degree on top of a DVM, you might have cool options. 

Basically as a vet, you signed up to work with people and no matter what you do, there will be work teams though. So, you might also want to work on what is happening with those people and see if you need to set better boundaries or something similar.I agree with many people here. I almost avoided medicine after school as well, but lost research funds and then went into private practice. Now I do both research and clinical medicine. Having the medicine in practice enriches the other.  You’ve spent all this time and energy learning medicine, give yourself a year and get out if that doesn’t work, there will always be a need for home euthanasias waiting for you. I think you’ll be grateful for what you learn.Life is too short and your debt too great to hate this job. Start looking for a different place especially before the class of 2024 gets in the pool. 

If you hate the new one just as much, there are a lot of niche fields to look at especially once you have 2 yrs of experience. You could go into industry repping products, spay/neuter clinics, shelter med, home euthanasias, relief work (makes a lot of $$ in big cities), etc. 

Don’t settle.Also, I just want to put out there that getting sued is very difficult in the vet field. As a pet owner, I hate it but as a practitioner, it is comforting. The burden of proof to litigate falls mostly on the owner and is very difficult to bring through court. And unfortunately even though I think my 6 yo dog is worth $50million, the court will only value him at his market worth, so I’d be lucky to get $500 for him.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

cappy267,"it’s USAJobs.gov ***** not usajobs.com but i think it redirects there if you type it in.I would be interested in either starting a non-profit or working for one instead of a typical for profit clinic. I know it would be extremely hard work and maybe unrealistic but that’s my motivation right now. 

Do you have a suggestion on how to work at a clinic without being a technician? Most i’ve seen around me ask for technicians or veterinarians. I could maybe look for customer service roles but I’m not sure that would help me learn what actually goes on.

Edit: not sure why this is getting down voted. Anyone want to clue me in?I have been helping run a shelter diversion program through my local animal shelter as a volunteer and dedicating A LOT of hours to that. it’s definitely helpful and I also have volunteered at the shelter doing dog walking and enrichment and kennel clean out work. As well as fostering at rescues.

My city as well as i’m sure many other cities are in a major crisis with dog (and cat, but mostly dog) over population and it’s insane. It feels like the shelter and the diversion program is doing a lot and as much as it can and it just gets worse and worse. Honestly my dream would be to be a veterinary who gets grants to do free spay/neuter surgeries possibly from a mobile clinic and literally go street to street and do the surgeries right then and there. 

I know that sounds crazy and maybe unattainable but all the other work i’ve been doing feels so hopeless if the problem just keeps getting worse. A couple of the programs offer very limited free spay/neuter spots that go very fast and even then some people either aren’t willing or have no means of transportation. Then months later they’re calling saying they have 14 puppies they can’t care for and surrender :(. It’s just such an overwhelming problem and I feel like if i’m able to do a second job with that type of accreditation for free or get grants to pay me then maybe I can help. 

The above is just one example out of many that leads to this idea I’m just trying to help as much as I can. So many people can’t afford the vet care and end up with unwanted litters or if I could even just help educate and offer low cost options then more people might take it instead of producing so many more animals we don’t need. I don’t blame veterinarians for the prices they charge they deserve high pay as well as their staff but if i’m willing to help provide another option I want to.

I also think we need laws passed to help the problem but all I can do in that regard is vote and advocate for change.cool i’ll definitely look in to it! I saw Purdue offers an online part time technician program where you can do clinical hours at a local vet and never have to go to their campus. I might do that at some point so I can work my current job while getting this education and experience. I would love to try and work for a place that would cover the costs for me!i think i worded that poorly i was meaning that i would have to at least become a tech or veterinarian to help out. That having neither of those hasn’t been very helpful in comparison to what I could do if I had the license for either of them. Many of the volunteer opportunities near me ask for a tech or veterinary for certain events and I obviously am not qualified to help if I am not either of those things. 

I have spent time in a shelter clinic but only as a volunteer. I wouldn’t know how else I could spend time in one without becoming a tech or maybe a front desk admin person but that would require taking a day job when i already have one.

Edited to add: I know techs definitely do a lot and are valuable! Any experience i’ve had, the vet techs actually do more at the practice and do a lot of hard labor and it seems like an extremely difficult and under appreciated job. Wanted to make that clear! I just meant i have to at least do some kind of license to make more of a difference.I don’t think i’m passionate about rescue per se as being the only focus. I’ve found some rescue organizations near me demonize the city shelter for their euthanasia rate when it’s true that we can’t save them all. I’m passionate about trying to fix the root cause of the overpopulation problem that creates the need for rescues to exist. I love rescues and the very important work that they do. But I want to be part of the solution and TNR and spay/neuter dogs at a low cost BEFORE rescues get called to take in 13 “unexpected” puppies and 5 bottle baby kittens found in the street. And the 30 adult dogs that were found running stray unaltered in 1 day alone. 

I know there are root causes beyond that like education and local laws that could be passed to help. But if I don’t have control over policies in my city except for my vote, then I want to try and do something that I can have control over.Cool! Did you take pre reqs for vet school or did you become a vet tech first then become a vet? I like my data analysis career but feel like I want to make a bigger impact on the world and see my work actually make a difference.that’s kind of where i’m at. Great money but so burnt out already and I want to do something more meaningful.Yes lots of great points. My main motivation is to prevent and reduce overpopulation. My city shelter euthanizes dogs because of how bad it is and I fully support their decisions to euthanize for the sake of the dogs and they go insane in their kennels for long periods of time and deteriorate fast. I would support them even if they had to euthanize at a higher rate than they currently do because it’s so bad and is unfortunately necessary. I would definitely support euthanasia if the animal would suffer otherwise. 

The organization I currently support covers emergency care in cases like you mentioned where the owner can’t afford it but of course we can’t help everyone. I want to prevent all of the unwanted dogs and not have such a huge stray dog problem with a shelter that is at capacity 24/7 so they are unable to help. And the vast majority of their intakes are all unaltered. So really my focus would be solely spay/neuter and less about the other medical treatment. 

However everyone makes good points where maybe I could assist organizations with grant writing and data analytics to increase their ability to provide low cost options. I just find some organizations like that cannot get the actual veterinarian or technician to work there because of low pay and many other factors. 

I’m just trying to find ways I can help the crisis as best as I can.I’ve definitely seen the toxicity in volunteer work so far and through my friends stories who are techs. It’s just hard to actually get that experience without sinking money into being a tech first it feels like that’s the only way. Unless anywhere ever needs like unlicensed assistance that can’t really do much work outside of what i’ve already done as a volunteer. But i’ll keep trying to get more involved.I make good money now and already paid off all my student loans from my other two degrees. That’s why I might do the part time tech school program to continue working my other job and just pay out of pocket. Then do part time shelter work as a tech and evaluate from there if I want to drop more money on being a veterinarian that could do something like that. 

I agree that is how the low cost programs work. I actually have done grant writing to get grants for the non profit I volunteer for and we pay for vet care for those who can’t afford it and those grants pay the salary for the director which is, yep you guessed it, a low salary. My masters degree had a focus on nonprofit financials so I have experience there. I fully understand it wouldn’t be a money maker or easy to live on if I did that full time.

That’s why it might just be a pipe dream. But I think maybe becoming a tech would be a good first step to see if the long term goal might be able to happen. Thanks for the info and hard questions! A lot to think about and consider!Nice! I hope it’s going well for you! I think i’m going to go that route because I could get some experience to see if I would want to invest more into schooling to become a vet. By veterinarian corporate do you mean one of the bigger name clinics but you work for their corporate headquarters instead of a in clinic job directly?ok i can look for that. I’ve done kennel cleaning at the local shelter as well as helping move animals to the medical room and transporting when needed. I’ll keep looking for more experience before deciding if I want to put money towards schooling to be either a technician or veterinarian.that’s a good point. I do love the advances in vet medical research that have been life saving. For example in 2021 I treated my family cat for FIP and saved his life. I would love to support the continued research on that and get the right things done to make it a legal practice. But I wouldn’t love performing the actual medical procedures myself except for the fact that I know it’s helping the animal or making a difference. 
I will continue to explore options to get more involved but as I mentioned in another comment I want to help be a solution to the over population problem that is causing burn out in the city shelter and rescues.

Please note you must first enable your wallet under the Polygon Network and then import custom token MYST from the Polygon Network in order to see the received tokens in your balance.​﻿​﻿Below is a guide on how to do so:​﻿  
Link Metamask to the Polygon network   
Link MetaMask to the Polygon Network​﻿  
Open MetaMask console and switch the connected blockchain (network) by clicking on the tab saying Ethereum Mainnet, we need to add the Polygon network.  
Scroll down until you find Custom RPC.  
Enter in the Polygon Mainnet settings as follows:  
Network Name: Polygon Mainnet  
New RPC URL: https://polygon-rpc.com/  
Chain ID: 137  
Currency Symbol (optional): MATIC  
Block Explorer URL (optional): https://polygonscan.com/​﻿  
You have now connected to the Polygon mainnet with your Metamask Wallet! You can now interact with Polygon tokens like $MYST while connected to Polygon. Note that transactions on the Polygon network requires its native token MATIC which will be used as gas fee. You can get MATIC tokens in any DEX available in the Ethereum Mainnet (such as at @Uniswap) and then bridge the tokens to Polygon.  
   
   
Adding MYST token to MetaMask on the Polygon Mainnet   
﻿To add MYST token to your MetaMask, go to the main MetaMask account page. Click on the assets tab, where you’ll see Add Token at the bottom.  
﻿After you click Add Token, navigate to the Custom Token tab and manually enter the MYST token details. Copy the Token Contract Address (please find below) and paste that onto the Custom Token tab on MetaMask.

If you have more than 1 public IP address then sure go ahead otherwise there isn't a benefit to the network or the consumers.Currently there is 1 node from Lebanon.If each node has its own public IP address then it will be fine.It is currently being worked on that's why it looks as it does just now.Buy however much you want from an exchange https://www.mexc.com/exchange/MYST_USDTPolygon fees had escalated due to external factors. With the latest node update you can choose when to settle so that you can choose when to settle and avoid transaction fees.Don't withdraw such a small amount. The latest node version allows you when to withdraw.
Currently Polygon free have shot up due to NFT gaming so most of that went to pay network fees.That amount of MYST would last a long time for some 😎You can find a list of where to purchase here, [https://mysterium.network/token/](https://mysterium.network/token/) but as has been mentioned by [/u/JimnyJones](https://www.reddit.com/user/JimnyJones) HitBTC is currently probably the best one to use.Mysterium Network begins its official token migration today, 31st August 2020. This will be a 1:1 token migration, so no new tokens will be created. Legacy tokens will not be supported in the network, so you will need to migrate your tokens before topping up in-app.

[http://bit.ly/MYST-migration-starts](http://bit.ly/MYST-migration-starts)

TL;DR:

💰1:1 Migration - no new tokens created

📑Manual migration for tokens on decentralised exchanges and ethereum wallets

🚀We're working with HitBTC to automagically migrate your tokens. Hold tight for more information

Staking 1000MYST will allow you to earn up to 10DAI per day. Staking 500MYST will allow you to earn 5DAI per day. So the amount you staking is proportional to the limit of DAI you can earn per day. 

You can read up more on the future of Tokenomics 2.0 at the link below.
https://www.mysterium.network/post/introducing-myst-tokenomics-2-0-powered-by-the-iq-protocolThere  is Whitelisting where all the traffic is know to Mysterium and all clients have gone through KYC.  
Your own nodeUI already provides you with logs of time, date and duration.

A node runner from Germany had been contacted from a copyright holder about data they had transferred. They were able to respond with the data from the NodeUI and that resolved their situation.There has been more than one person in Germany who was contacted by a rights holder and in all cases using the logs they already have none of the cases went any further.

Torrenting or anything else, none of the data exists on your system.

You know there is Whitelisting and that will solve the above issue, it's up to you on what you choose.Mysterium gives privacy not anonymity.
All countries have different laws and that why there is Whitelisting of nodes available.
https://docs.mysterium.network/resources/faq/#how-does-mysterium-network-use-whitelisting-to-protect-usersThis is quite dependant on your countries laws. When a consumer agrees to use the service they do so on the agreement that they only use it for legal purposes.
If a consumer should do anything illegal then they are the ones committing an offence, not the node.

This is also why whitelisting of nodes exist so this would not be an issue.This is quite dependant on your countries laws. When a consumer agrees to use the service they do so on the agreement that they only use it for legal purposes.

So that is the separation gap node runner never know the wallet address of consumers and vise versa.

If you wish be a consumers and use the Mysterium service. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vm18yl/balance_gone_after_importing_wallet/ie22qsn/  You topped your account for VPN as a consumer. And you have taken that address to use as a node provider.
You haven't provided a service so you haven't earned anything. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vkctz2/imported_my_identity_to_my_docker_container_of/idoln81/  Not sure what you are trying to do but if you are wanting to use Mysterium as a consumer follow one of the guides here 
https://docs.mysterium.network/ 
Under For Users and select whatever system you are using. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vkctz2/imported_my_identity_to_my_docker_container_of/idtey7g/  If you pay $100 to be allowed to even just install the app when you could get a SBC (hardware) and have a lot of money left over instead of paying for privilege.

There is a command flag that you can use that can disable this security feature.

   --firewall.protected.networks value                                

List of comma separated (no spaces) subnets to be protected from access via VPN (default: ""10.0.0.0/8,172.16.0.0/12,192.168.0.0/16,127.0.0.0/8"") ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vadoe5/proxy_127001_to_client_program/ic2pbbt/  What was the -flag you used, it should be:

You can use https://sideshift.ai/ to get MATIC and then https://quickswap.exchange/#/swap to exchange MATIC to MYST on Polygon. 
You can then store them using Metamask.

But you can pay with a variety of different crypto is that is easier for you. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/v6opob/transferring_myst_from_coinbase_wallet_to_vpn/ibmfwjp/  Then the answer is no. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/v5foqb/increase_node_usage/ibdvuuz/  What is there version you have? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uy5m0m/mysterimum_is_super_lagging_recently/ia32q7z/  There are no referral codes. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uxj7rr/i_am_making_a_new_account_can_anyone_share_their/i9y4s1w/  You can't be a conspiritor in something that you don't know.

From the documentation:

`myst-data:/var/lib/mysterium-node`

Note 1: Replace myst-data with the path where you'd like to store the node's configuration and keystore files, e.g.

So if your updating your node just point it to the same directory.

This will be a 1:1 token migration, so no new tokens will be created. Legacy tokens will not be supported in the network, so you will need to migrate your tokens before topping up in-app.

[http://bit.ly/MYST-migration-starts](http://bit.ly/MYST-migration-starts)

TL;DR:

💰1:1 Migration - no new tokens created

📑Manual migration for tokens on decentralised exchanges and ethereum wallets

🚀We're working with HitBTC to automagically migrate your tokens. Hold tight for more information

Staking 1000MYST will allow you to earn up to 10DAI per day. Staking 500MYST will allow you to earn 5DAI per day. So the amount you staking is proportional to the limit of DAI you can earn per day.

When a consumer agrees to use the service they do so on the agreement that they only use it for legal purposes.
If a consumer should do anything illegal then they are the ones committing an offence, not the node.

This is also why whitelisting of nodes exist so this would not be an issue. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/q400jq/risk_of_allowing_illegal_activity_that_makes_you/hfv6kdb/  With the upcoming release on mainnet will original ICO backers see any benefits / acknowledgements? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/gc3zxw/ama_jaro_šatkevic_head_of_product_9_am_est_5th/fpivrm4/  Our latest partnership is with Parsiq and they are a big part of our Tokenomics 2.0 with Matic Network allowing cheaper P2P payments, there is also a partnership with Storj Labs.

This stake will work differently than one described in Tokenomics 2.0.

NOTE: Testnet3 nodes migrated into mainnet will be not required to stake and will be registered for free (Mysterium team will cover blockchain fees required for node registration)  


2. An update should be all that is required. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/qwqzms/changes_with_mainnet_launch/hl4n25n/  Upgrade to version 0.67.1 if that's not your latest version.

Effective-Clock-7333,"San Francisco, CA here! We added another doctor in October (to make 5 FT) and then were horribly slow through the rest of 2023 and into january. We noticed that the beginning and ends of the week would fill so Wednesday when all doctors were working, we were so slow across the board. So we spread doctor schedules out a bit more and trained our front desk to be more intentional about trying to schedule mid week. We are finally picking up. But honestly, i was speaking with the other doctors and despite being so bored some days, i’ve liked the change of pace to allow me more time per appointment and feel more inclined to really work things up. As has been mentioned in other comments, it has helped me slow down, develop my soft skills, spend more time researching weird labwork results, consult with other doctors, etc. 
For the last two months, all of our average invoices have gone up by $100-150. Because we are working things up and taking more time to explain value of diagnostics or do those sedation procedures in real time. 
One of our doctors is leaving at the end of this month, so I think things will spread out more evenly soon. I also think there was a national slowdown that is now improving. 
Hang in there!scribenote user here! It has been such a great resource for me and made my records so much more consistent. I’m at a four doc practice and two of us vets use it. I love it! I also love that it gives a free trial of 100 recordssalary depends a lot on location and specialty. Small animal ER vets generally make the most of everyone. I’m in the bay area, started making 125k as a new grad doing small animal GP. Yes I have loads of student debt but it’s federal, so payback has been delayed with Covid and now payments can’t be more than 10% of the income i take home, so it will never bleed me dry- it’s obviously just very annoying to be giving away over 1k a month in payments. Honestly, i find it all very manageable. I have no family money, i am not independently wealthy, I worked three part time jobs in undergrad and vet school, still graduated with no savings. Two years out, I feel very financially comfortable. I did not join this field for the money, I did it because i love it, but if i sit and think about my debt, it would make me miserable. I pay my loans, I do fun stuff when i’m not working, all is well. But maybe don’t join the field for the money.people who have a soul?omg i am so sorry that happened! you should not be feeling that guilt on top of something so stressful! You are not a fuck up!! You are not a fuck up! You absolutely deserve mentorship and a safe place to learn. Literally what it’s all about. If that on site vet is not comfortable providing that and getting you out of a pinch sometimes, that’s on her and not you. 
Practice is obviously the biggest way to get a feel for tension you need, but also take it SLOW and check yourself over and over. it is not a race!!!! We are typically castrating young and healthy dogs so a couple extra minutes under anesthesia is ok in order to make sure your ties are secure. 
I have been in hairy moments and start moving faster because i’m worried, but that’s usually when i make more and other mistakes. Deep breaths, ask for help, keep learning and growing!I had no financial help from family and basically came from undergrad, so limited savings. I took out max student loans out of necessity and that left me with roughly $900 a month to spend on everything besides rent (not other bills). I worked three jobs in vet school, one was an overnight on-call tech for the radiology department and I was able to keep that all 4 years. It sucked getting up in the middle of the night, sometimes every few hours, but i was able to do it despite my day time schedule. It also was really great experience. In colorado (where I went), students could also apply for food stamps. Which I did by my second year and that also helped me dramatically in my day to day experience. I can’t say how many hours/week I was working because that was hugely based on my school schedule. I liked working for the teaching hospital/vet school because they were extremely understanding about my student responsibilities. Whereas working outside of the college meant less of that. So I recommend looking for that if you can!","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

jnmo253,"Practice Manager here. If any of my staff was treating a DVM (or any other member of staff that way), I’d be pissed and it’d be an immediate write up with a PIP attached. 

As many mentioned, it’s ok to be wary of a new DVM but your team is there to support you and help you learn. I’d bring this issue up with your practice manager and if it doesn’t resolve, I’d find another clinic to work at. There’s no shortage of DVM jobs and so many clinics would treat you better.Handwritten notes and healthy snacks! We also had a client bring in assorted tea, honey, and the Starbucks coffee carafes with assorted creamers and that was a HUGE hit - us vet med folks are always tired.I should add too - things that give a laugh are appreciated as well. We had a client with a little westie that pooped on someone every single appointment, without fail. His owner had vet med themed cookies made with his face, poop emojis, and lab coats and stethoscopes. They were not cheap but we still talk about them years later.My clinic team would lose their minds over this. So thoughtful!People without tattoos and piercings are in the minority at my clinic!

* You will no longer need to stake MYST to run a node, and
* Rewards will be paid in MYST instead of DAI.

The question I have is:

**WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF STAKING MYST?**

In the original model, MYST had value because you needed to stake it to earn rewards on your node. If you didn't have enough MYST, you could borrow it from the delegation pool. Now, in the new model, you can stake MYST, but there is no reason to borrow MYST. ~~And what is the source of interest that you earn by staking? Does this come from the stash of MYST that the mysterium founders have?~~ In my opinion, staking and the delegation pool make no sense in the current model. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wwp5kg/to_enhance_rewards_for_our_community_of_myst/ilpk7ag/  Concerning the origin of the interest paid to stakers, the post says 

>Delegation Pool rewards will be generated from Mysterium’s collected   
network fees (Hermes smart contract fees), and redistributed to those   
who stake in the Delegation Pool

However, I still don't understand the purpose of staking. Stakers offer NO BENEFIT to the mysterium ecosystem. Though I will be happy to receive staking rewards, stakers are simply leaches.

As a node runner, 10% of my earning are taken as fees. A portion of these fees will go to pay stakers, even though stakers don't do anything and are not needed for the system to work. Perhaps this will introduce scarcity of MYST because people will buy MYST just to get a portion of the network fees, but, this is completely artificial. We simply don't need stakers in the revised 2.0 model. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wwp5kg/to_enhance_rewards_for_our_community_of_myst/ilpl4em/  Thanks, I did read the FAQ. The node runner UI also says something similar

>""Safe option: traffic vetted via business contracts and unavailable to the general public. This option potentially will give less reward.""

What I am asking is: What kind of traffic is this? Is there any risk at all that my residential IP will be blocked from places like Amazon, Netflix, etc? Or is the traffic entirely benign with no risk whatsoever? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wuy5hx/what_is_mysterium_verified_partner_traffic/ildbv2z/  I am using pihole on a raspberry pi as a recursive dns resolver. You can install this on the same pihole that is being used for myst. After doing this, you just click on the traffic coming from localhost to see what myst is doing. This is not foolproof, because in the myst client, you have the option of choosing which dns to use. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wuy5hx/what_is_mysterium_verified_partner_traffic/ilkfjcm/  I totally agree with what you are saying about the risk. However, I think that I am asking a very reasonable question that the Mysterium team should be able to answer:

I think he bought all the supplies from a farm store. Then the dog started chewing the area so he (maybe asked for medical advice at that point) and he put a cone around the dog’s neck. Low and  behold his daughter couldn’t keep up with the puppy and they gave him away and the people who took him just assumed he was vaccinated because he was “fixed.” I wonder if they lived within city limits and tried to get him a dog license. If they lived outside of city limits a lot of people in the rural area I grew up in don’t bother to seek veterinary care for “farm animals” unless the animal gets sick although dogs are more likely cared for than cats or other animals.

mostlylighthearted,"I’m intrigued by these comments because I rarely use first names with doctors (my current practice I use their last name). I’m often curious about this topic and even asked a friend whose a human MD and she told me she doesn’t care whether hospital staff use her first name. I’d like to be able to freely use first names without feeling judged, I think it’s a good way to build workplace camaraderie. A couple of the dvms I work with don’t mind it but overall we use last name. 

The weirdest part for me is the doctors will use first names with each other and not the technicians. Like one dr.

Also, try to call or email local clinics and ask if there is any openings or even opportunities to shadow. Shadowing can be a starting point to land a paying job once they get to know you more and you showed the passion. Also, volunteering does not have to be full time if you need another job to support yourself, and most clinics don't take volunteers anyway due to liability issues. Volunteering will likely take place in nonprofits or animal shelters, some may have paying positions such as internships or clinic/office assistant jobs. I got my first VA job when I was in college volunteering for an aniaml shelter (later I received an internship offer at the same facility). I emailed the lead veterinarian for a chance to shadow and I got put to work on the spot lol. I understand finance can be hard at times because you just graduated and have no other source of income. But for veterinary experience, sometimes you have to focus on getting the experience rather than making money as the industry itself does not have high profit margin either.

I did not offer or even suggest I do the Sx, so I would appreciate if you would keep your opinion of my abilities to yourself and allow the senior veterinarians to be the ones to assist me with my improvement.” Or when they made the ‘no offense but you’re not good with any sick animal’, responding “despite you saying no offense, that was offensive and I would appreciate it going foreword that you would reframe from such comments. You are not the one reviewing my performance or guiding me to being a better vet, so your negative comments are unwarranted and unnecessary.” (*honestly that might be more snippy than necessary, but you get my point.)

A lot of people are bitter in this field, make sure that it doesn’t dull your sparkle. We need the good kind vets who will support future baby vets and techs.There is something to be said for confidence and reasonable caution. I also double check my work, I found others mistakes and my own frequently, and for certain things I have others check my work. I was told I was slow, but little to no errors were made. After a lot of criticism and jabs to my confidence, I tried to go faster. I made more mistakes and didn’t catch them until after the fact. All reversible, and avoidable if I would been allowed to double check myself or ask for assistance.

I find if you don’t meet the cocky confidence, making fun/hating on owners, hating/being aggressive with difficult patrons, life-sucks mentality; you are rejected, bullied, made to be miserable.

Among these visits, five consultative site evaluations are slated for proposed veterinary programs vying for accreditation.  
The consultative site visit serves as a crucial step for proposed veterinary colleges, offering them an unofficial report on their readiness to apply for a letter of reasonable assurance. Once deficiencies are addressed, institutions can proceed with a comprehensive site visit to determine eligibility for a letter of reasonable assurance—a pivotal milestone allowing them to begin enrolling students.  
These initiatives underscore the AVMA COE's commitment to fostering excellence in veterinary education and advancing the profession. Among the notable institutions undergoing evaluation is the Rowan University Shreiber School of Veterinary Medicine, with a comprehensive site visit scheduled for April 21-26. The program aims to enroll its inaugural class in fall 2025, pending accreditation.  
Additionally, consultative site visits are slated for prominent institutions such as Clemson University’s proposed College of Veterinary Medicine and Arkansas State University’s proposed College of Veterinary Medicine. These visits, scheduled for May 12-16 and July 7-11, respectively, reflect the growing demand for accredited veterinary programs across the nation.  
Another noteworthy addition to the accreditation pipeline is Chamberlain University's proposed School of Veterinary Medicine in Stockbridge, Georgia. Set for a consultative visit from August 11-15, the program aims to expand access to veterinary medicine education and address future workforce needs in the field.  
Furthermore, the University of Maryland Eastern Shore (UMES) is set to embark on a transformative journey with its proposed veterinary school. Scheduled for a consultative site visit from July 7-11, UMES aims to become the second historically Black college and university (HBCU) to offer a standalone veterinary program, following in the footsteps of Tuskegee University.  
Meanwhile, Rocky Vista University (RVU) has unveiled plans for its proposed College of Veterinary Medicine in Billings, Montana. The program, set for a consultative site visit from July 21-25, represents a significant milestone in RVU's commitment to expanding access to veterinary education.  
Lastly, Hanover College in Indiana is poised to launch a revolutionary hybrid accelerated veterinary program, pending accreditation. Backed by a $5.9 million grant from Indiana, the program seeks to revolutionize veterinary education by offering a blend of online lectures, hands-on laboratory experiences, and distributed clinical education opportunities.How to navigate the ECFG program

HyenaLucky3644,"If you’re open to moving internationally for school, that could also be a potential avenue for you. I was in a similar position (got a BA, didn’t have the pre-reqs for US Vet schools, was miserable in my field), so I did some research on programs that didn’t have those prerequisite course requirements. After weighing my options, I decided to go out on a limb and apply for some international programs at the age of 24, and now I’m in the pre-selection semester at Massey University in New Zealand! 

There are definitely ups and downs to this path. My program is designed for kids coming straight out of HS, with no university experience. This means that a.) a significant portion of my cohort is a lot younger than me (im 25 now!!) and b.) the degree is structured in such a way that if you don’t perform well in the first semester (the pre-selection phase), you won’t advance in the program. This can add a lot of stress to the first semester, especially if you’re uprooting your whole adult life to move countries ( l o l ). The program is also 5 years long, instead of the standard 4 years. 

That being said, I’m really happy I came here. I’ve met several students who are also older (people up in their late 30’s !!) and it seems like we all kind of flock together. The courses are rigorous, but if you’ve done any uni before and understand time management, etc. they’re very doable. The cost of attendance after converting from USD to NZD is lower per year than out of state tuition to US vet schools, but paying for the 5th year of the program means that you’ll probably graduate with about the same amount of debt as an out-of-state US program. 

Right now I feel confident that I’ll be moving forward in the program, but if for whatever reason I’m not selected I would probably be singing a different tune. 

Do lots of research, and don’t be afraid to reach out to uni advisors with whatever questions you
may have about their programs. I also definitely second the advice of getting some hands on vet med experience before you decide anything final. Whatever you decide, good luck !!At least for Massey, you only apply via their internal system! Getting into the pre-selection semester is pretty easy, but moving on in the program is more difficult. There are 2 tests and some interviews you have take during your first semester, on top of a pretty full course load. 

The university won’t tell us how many international students there are applying to get past the pre-selection semester, but they did let us know there are 50 places available for international students. Apparently last year, when there were 39 or so places available, every international student who qualified was offered a seat.","Veterinarian Student.

Dart_Throwing_Monke,"Male, Sac area of california, new grad (under 1 yr out), 130k 20% production (about to be 145k), no mentorship / training program, moderately busy practices (mostly small animal gp but we take some urgent care)

5x 8 hr days

10 days PTO

$1750 CE / yr

This is a cool idea I wish I knew about this sub when I interviewed lolThis is going to be a rant

I was put with one, but she is not pleasant to be around

I don’t ask a lot of questions, sometimes just “across the room” questions like “how do you do your tapering pred dose” or something simple

Maybe a question once every other day about something minute, and she complained to the manager saying that if she has to help me then she wants half of the production

I also never worked in gp before (I have a strictly wildlife only background) so i don’t know if this behavior is normal or not. So I look up everything. Ive looked up leg amputations, cystotomies, foreign bodies, and most things I feel is OK for a GP to do and isn’t super complex

It was annoying but mentally not bad for me. I know that as long as I understand the theory behind what I’m doing and listen to specialists on youtube / few websites who give their insight, itll be alright. Especially parts where they talk about common mistakes they see in GP, I feel that is super valuable too. Usually theres some bit about that in any article

After I told the guy who hired me about that, I work alone now and I much prefer it. Though it would still be nice to have someone else around to get their thoughts on complicated cases. 

Edit: I just remembered that shes the opposite and she is too scared to look things up and now asks me how to do some procedures like digit amputations or legs. I help but for the good of the practice only, otherwise I sure as hell wouldnt want tohttps://youtu.be/JuMtwZ-HBqc?si=KnG90RtnjOFUw6Fg

I watch a lot of vetdojo stuff! Nothing orthopedic like in the video unless I wanna familiarize myself w the procedure for fun but they’re gr8I joke to my techs that I should 🤣Awesome!New grad here 9 months out. Kinda was dropped into a busier practice by myself

I would forget to do some things, like add on meds or maybe some diagnostic… but it has not been a big deal in the end, I’m assuming its likely been the same for you as well

Pretty much as soon as I realized that, it stopped mattering to me. Also I look up a lot of stuff and its not a big deal too, a lot of my seniors did the same. They learned most of their surgeries from youtube and a few sites (like vetfolio, dvm360, cliniciansbrief, etc) and I’m doin the same

I think most new grads are the same so its ok

Id definitely listen to the other comments before mine, but mine are just some thoughts 🤷‍♂️Do you remember which test you took? I took all 3 and my lowest score was most accurate to the real score

And it was the same across my group of friends

The test was NOT the answer option one, so one of the other two…cant remember but it was the same one for all of us that was most accurateProbably depends on the area, urban areas no one cares

BirdLawOnly,"Their treatment towards you in uncalled for, but as an LVT of nearly a decade, I understand not wanting a new grad touching my animal. Don't get me wrong, they could be more delicate. Here is my reasoning:

Those who get accepted into vet school have good book smarts, but the applicable veterinary skills are often no more than kennel attendant and grooming. I have done A LOT of work with 4th year residents coming through my HQHVSN clinic, and they have no technical skills. Can't restrain, can't draw blood, can't place a catheter, can't do much of anything. Sure, that's why you have techs, but you should be able to perform these tasks should you be short. 45min for a routine spay is good starting out, but too long overall, granted I work with doctors who do 100lb spays in 15min, and cat spays in 2min. Basically, we see new grad DVMs as babies- sponges of book knowledge but no ability to put it to use. Again, their treatment towards you is messed up, but the reasoning is there.","Veterinarian.

Unhappy_Passenger_86,"As some one who is also coming from a difficult situation and trying to pursue vet school, I have the greatest amount of empathy for you and your situation. I had my son my sophomore year of college and being practically homeless made it really difficult. I worked full time, took care of my son and just tried to barely survive. My end GPA at my undergrad school was 2.89. so I completely understand that low grades can be hard to come back from. 
I share this because I have gone on to get waitlisted at a vet school and this year I have again gotten interviews and a chance to go. Look at each vet school before you write yourself off and see what their requirements are and how they calculate GPA. I put mine into a Google doc so it was easy to read. I then looked VERY critically at my own academic experience and matched all the classes I had taken and their grades with the prereqs of each school.  A lot of schools (not all) out more weight on last 45 (semester credits, 60 quarter credits) than on overall GPA. If you can show in your last 45-60 credits that you were able to turn your grades around, it makes a really compelling case for you GPA wise. As for the DUI, I would be honest but not overly ""woah is me"" when it comes to discussing it.  They are not robots and the admissions people are generally awesome to talk to. So go into it with a growth mindset. ""I messed up, but here is what I learned and how I am taking steps in the future to keep it from happening again."" 
Diverse experiences and lots of hours will also help your case. If you look at your experience and see you don't have large animal or research, try to find ways to really get as much variety and length of hours as you can. I work in the research field, so my hours there number over 10k, but I had never worked in private practice, so I called every vet practice I could reasonably get to and found one that let me shadow. If you love wildlife, get involved at a wildlife rehab place and show that you really do want to be in that field, or become a zoo volunteer. Your past is only a fraction of who you are. Spend the vet school application showing them who you are now, and take steps to prove you have what it takes. Best of luck to you in your current and future endeavors!

meghanhoe,"1. Do NOT lose sleep to study. Pick a time of day you will be done (I made it earlier and earlier as school went on 😂 but vowed I would never study so late that it would take away from sleep!)

2. Be open to changing your mind about your career. I was very set on internship and residency but realized that GP has a lot to offer too should not be undervalued compared to academia (basically don’t feel like you are not as high achieving because becoming a DVM alone is such a huge accomplishment and a ton of work/knowledge is required for it too). 

3. Have a small circle and do not feel like you need to be around people who cause drama. There is zero extra energy to put up with all of that and I found that the smaller my circle was the more peace I had. 

4. Find other hobbies unrelated to vet med and make time for it every day. Doesn’t matter what it is, you just need complete separation from it to quell the burn out. 

5. Get involved in clubs like HSVMA/other clubs that allow students to practice surgery, hugely helpful before junior surgery starts to have some idea of the common procedures :)

6. Use Notion for studying. Make a table for every class and you can add a date to the table so you know when you last studied that material.

Jazzyhoss,"Are you worried because you’re an Island student coming into Purdue? Most of my island friends did great and had a decent experience. There was some prejudice against island students from staff (more technicians than anyone) but the admin during my year have Island students the same name badges as us Purdue students so it was harder to determine. 

Most rotations are very work-like hours. Internal medicine, surgery, and emergency/critical care rotations have the longest hours, sometimes with night treatments. Learning about other schools now, I’d say Purdue often uses its fourth year vet students as cheap tech labor. On one hand you do get some decent training and exposure to more cases. On the other hand doing eye drops in ECC at 11pm isn’t really what you as a vet will be doing post graduation. So look at the treatment plans of your patients and try and understand the whys. A lot too depends on how helpful your blockmates are and teamwork. My blockmates were always great about pitching in to get things done. 

I really enjoyed my Ancillary rotation. The hours were great and the workload wasn’t over the top and we saw a lot of sad, but interesting cases. My poultry rotation was probably my favorite, but I dont really see chickens anymore. But Dr. Wakenell, the poultry princess was a riot and amazing to work with.

Most ISP offer ""unlimited"" data so unless your node is actively moving data 24/7 (it won't maybe up to 30Gb a coyoem times a day of you lucky) then I'm sure you will be fine.
I think the worst thi g they could do is just end your contact and blacklist you but again unlikely ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/13mz4i6/can_my_isp_see_that_im_operating_a_myst_node_when/jljthsd/  Wow really how do you know you were suffering a DDoS attack?

Your external IP is not revealed to any of the users of the network.

I suspect you probably have relatively slow internet bandwidth and the mysterium node was using it all up leaving you with a slow and unreliable connection.

You can fix this by implementing AQM (active queue management) on your router/gateway. There is lots of info about it if you look here [https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/wiki/What\_can\_I\_do\_about\_Bufferbloat/](https://www.bufferbloat.net/projects/bloat/wiki/What_can_I_do_about_Bufferbloat/) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ydbp1q/how_much_would_i_earn/itzsjrc/  Are you hosting any other services other than mysterium? Because if you are then that may be how you are being targeted.

Or your ISP has given you a crappy router that does not expect to have so many incoming connections.

My node can have over 600 connections in 24 hours and I think thats only counting the connections which actually transfer data. There are probably 1000s of incoming connections every day.

My node has made 200 myst in 17 days and my connection had been rock solid.

But I run OpenWRT as a router and had FQ\_CoDel which will share my bandwidth across all users and keep my ping low ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ydbp1q/how_much_would_i_earn/iu0es9o/  Ah I dont use the VPN myself but I know you will be limtied by the connection speed of the node you connect to.

I actually run my router OS as a virtual machine on Proxmox this allows me to send all myst traffic over a VLAN to the myst node running on the same hardware. This way the traffic never makes it onto my LAN.

I suspect your router is supplied by your ISP and as such not the best.

I think mysterium can make me about £70 a month so maybe investing a bit into your network/router could be worth it? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ydbp1q/how_much_would_i_earn/iu0k73h/  Are you trying to follow this tutorial? https://docs.dappnode.io/get-started/installation/custom-hardware/installation/script/ ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y8lzbi/dappnote/itqiefx/  Yea I don't run a dappnode i just run mysterium on its own but if you have succesfully installed the dappnode then you now need to access it which can be dont via a proxy

or a VPN

Yea I don't run a dappnode i just run mysterium on its own but if you have successfully installed the dappnode then you now need to access it which can be done via a proxy.

&#x200B;

But seriously why not just run mysterium on its own you dont need all the other fluff from dappnode

But seriously why not just run mysterium on its own you don't need all the other fluff from dappnode ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y8lzbi/dappnote/itzrnvi/  what do you mean ""but i dont know where it goes""?

Have you used docker before? what OS are you running docker on? Do you actually have docker installed? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y8lvjw/setup_manually_using_docker_advanced/itqiq84/  I don't use dappnode i just run a mysterium container directly.

However, once your container is installed you will need to navigate to it via a web browser at http://dappnode.local  

But why use dappnode? it's a much more complicated way of doing things. It had a proxy and VPN all built into it. So if your struggling with just a single container I really don't think you need all that added complexity.

I think my node should make approx £70 this month and I can get an additional broadband line for approx £40 per month (looking for something with a 50mbps+ upload).

Of course, then you need two routers and multiple myst nodes. But you virtualise all of this gear so not an issue there really.

I would be worried that the MYST price drops and you cant cash out enough to cover the line rental and then you're making a loss until the price comes up again.

Of course, then you need two routers and multiple myst nodes. But you virtualize all of this gear so not an issue there really. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y3lc4u/zero_earning_on_vps/itqmc3u/  I run proxmox and have an OpenWRT VM for the firewall and a mysterium node running in a container.

I don't route my traffic through the VPN it's just an endpoint for the mysterium network so I can earn some crypto.

I did have to enable IP routing on the host (proxmox) to allow the  myst node to work correctly and have full cone NAT.

&#x200B;

But may I ask why you want to route all your traffic through a VPN? I can understand streaming through it to avoid geo-blocking. But other than that it costs money and complexity to your internet access. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xznret/home_network_vpn_with_spare_pc_as_router_running/irqtj7k/  I use a service called NextDNS so when a user connects to my exit node their DNS queries are resolved by NextDNS. I then have a separate config for all myst traffic in NextDNS and I filter out the nasty stuff that way.

It's not perfect as they could get around it but it adds a layer of security, also from what I understand the mysterium network already has some filters which restrict what can get onto their network.

Either way in 17 days my node has earnt 240 myst with 220 of that coming from B2B (which is going to be much safer) so I could turn off public browsing and really not notice ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xymxnq/legal_issues_regarding_running_mysterium/itztr84/  It took a lot of setting up. I initially ran it via docker on my storage server but it did not like the idea of the traffic going over my internal network.

I the end I set up the Linux client on an LXC container on proxmox with a VLAN so the traffic is isolated from my network. This proxmox hypervisor also runs my router OpenWRT in a VM so the traffic literally never gets past the fist box in my network.

I did also have to enable ip\_forwarding on proxmox and also a port forward on the router to the myst node.

I the end I set up the Linux client on an LXC container on proxmox with a VLAN so the traffic is isolated from my network. This proxmox hypervisor also runs my router OpenWRT in a VM so the traffic literally never gets past the first box in my network.

At another, had a nurse that was just the most frustrating. She would tell us all the damn time ""I got Puppy from the same breeder as the Kardashians!"" but would complain about how much she had paid for the dog already when we would give her estimates... My sister in christ your dog keeps eating random shit and needing to be treated! Maybe ask the kardashians what fucking dog trainer they used????some feed stores still carry rabies, which is wild. like where tf are they even getting them! i was on the hunt for smth specific last year so went to my local feed store... lo and behold, there was a big 10ml RV labeled ""for farm animals only"" on the display.

i mentioned that it's not considered a legal rabies vx if its not administered by a vet, and might not even be legal to sell. the guy i told was apparently the owner. he caught a huge attitude and told me to mind my own business. 🙄 (yes i reported them lol. havent been back to see if its still sold.)Most places in the usa, afaik, you don't need a breeder permit. It's like, yeah it'd be nice to not see these people, but where do you draw the line? Plenty of ppl think all breeders are evil, after all. Why not offer education to these people instead of simply turning them away? What if all high-end clinics start doing this? At least these people are getting the animals vaccinated or health confirmed by a vet, right? Etc etc etc.

None of these questioms are actually directed at you, more of a general ""where do we draw the line"".

As for the unhoused population breeding, that isn't so much an issue of ""breeding"" as it is monetary concerns. It's very hard to get in to a place that can desex a pet for no cost to unhoused owners, after all. Hopefully, if your purchase goes thru, you'll be able to work with a charity/group to offer desexing to the extreme poverty and unhoused client base!lmao imagining clients asking multiple times a day about a tattoo is terrifying. that's just a sign that OP shouldn't work there, those ppl are crazy. clients don't demand the explanation of our tattoos unless the tattoo is very unique for some reason.

Those fees will be used for this purposes and etc :)That's his auto settlement (0.9MYST).That's right!Again, please understand that team won't take additional money from you, it could be a bug and need to be identified and fixed soon.  


I also request you to update the node, your minimum automatic settlement will be increased from 0.9MYST to 5MYST.Yes, I reported it to the team and I said you on discord that it went 3000 Gwei for a min approx and back to normal.

bischswish,"Thank you for the detailed response!What are the hours? I'm assuming these are relief rates since it's daily. $750 is low for 8-6, but better 8-5. I would recommend hiring on full time vet and technician at $130k and $60k, respectively. You will have trouble breaking even at those contract daily rates in a rural area.  I recommend enticing people for full-time employment. I would also make it a priority to get your clinic approved as a non-profit 501c3 org so that a veterinarian can get public service loan forgiveness through employment with you. I think technicians can do that as well.The fact that you will be non-profit may help you be more competitive, and pslf WILL be very competitive. Any vet jobs that fulfill PSLF are 100k. I'm just worried your underserved area is underserved for a reason... vet care is expensive, and rural folks often can't afford even a rabies vaccine.It's common to be inexperienced and slow at first. I was when I started. Even after my development into a good well-rounded vet, they still treated me like a baby vet. So I peaced out. You may need to find another place and start fresh. That's not giving up. It's just finding a place that deserves your skills.These classes are for people who have zero communication skills and need to learn how to talk to people. You think it's stupid that they tell you to give eye contact and say hello.... but some people need to learn that. I think that's why more schools are doing the MMI format. Some people need to be filtered out because they may be book smart, but will never instill trust in a client because they cannot communicate.

So once you're out, you'll be fine. Like most people.Male, 4 years out. $50/h. No production. Liability and CE $2500. DEA not reimbursed. Small Animal only. $125/h doing relief on the side 1-2 days per week. Gross about 130k. Texas medium cost of living.My main job has zero stress, is incredibly easy, commute is 15 minutes, I never work weekends, and it is counting towards PSLF. I also have young children I can always hang out with. Sometimes, less money works.Important to note VCA and Banfield both owned by same megacorp Mars.Many more openings in red states and majority of DVMs are women. I wonder why...Too many sour grapes when you haven't started practicing yet. 

Steering people away because you haven't gotten adequate exposure in aquatic medicine? An incredibly niche specialty with barely anyone practicing it? 

Some professors are arrogant, and some aren't. Some clients are stupid, and some aren't. You will deal with assholes in any profession. 

Cost benefit is very different now. Average salary has gone up at least 20%. 

Report back in another few years. It would be stupid to give up now.I frequently used Metro for enteritis/colitis. Not anymore. I never really used Prazosin for UO in cats because the evidence was never really there. Prescription diet change is always better for both. 

Recently, plumbs changed their Metro indications section and flags that specific use as controversial. Also links those studies you mentioned. Go plumbs.I'm not going back. Just thought it was funny they ""found"" the money magically.The hospital I worked at consistently has the main doctor going on maternity for entire Q1 2024. They were trying to play games with me and now they are fucked. More than half of the days each week will be dark. 

I do feel bad for the technicians because they are paying the price for Mars being greedy. I hope they bail too and realize their worth.","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it discusses various aspects of veterinary practice, including surg",Veterinarian

Noel_VdC,"Hi,
In order to do that you need to run each node on docker, create one network interface per public ip address and bind each container with a separate network interface. After that you can access each node UI on is own public address.Be sure to have residential ip addresses, I run a node on a vps with a non residential ip since three or for months and I've not received the first payment. In my experience, if your node isn't residential it has less interest for customers.Hi,
Nodes showing in mysterium dark as been limited to 1000 (randomly choosen) per country, that's the reason why.Hi,
I don't know much more, officially to improve the service, there's since a couple of day's a discussion about that on office telegram group.The list of 1000 is not permanent, he his randomized permanentlyHi,

It depends on what you do, pricing for streaming, download, scrapping, etc are not the same.

You can have an idea on the official site, scroll down to calculator section :

[https://www.mysteriumvpn.com/godark](https://www.mysteriumvpn.com/godark)There's no fee, you pay what you need and this amount is converted to MYST tokens at the current value. If you top-up when MYST token is low, you get more tokens. After that you pay your usage with the tokens you have, that's why it's difficult to say in money how much it cost, it's always the same amount of Myst tokens but with a token price variable as other cryptos.Yes you can pay with card, mysterium will do the change. Only dark allow to choose the node, on mysterium 2.0 you can only choose the country.Residential and others are clearly separated on the client, you can filter.

To see purposals you can use the discovery Api, this api is the one behind nodes list on the Mysterium client :

https://discovery.mysterium.network/api/v3/proposalsIt's real time, you can see all info about each active nodeHi,

In three steps :

First of all check on polygonscan if you can see your tokens, if your Myst balance on polygonscan is zero, of course you can't see it on metamask. 

On metamask add the polygon mainnet network :
https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/tools/wallets/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/

On metamask too, add the MYST token, you need to add it on polygon network :
https://help.mystnodes.com/en/articles/8004186-adding-myst-token-to-metamask-on-the-polygon-mainnetGreat, you're welcome!Hi,

Seems like the issue is on mysterium infrastructures, just wait for now.Hi,
Can you post your node ID?Hi,
Did the internal ip of you raspberry on your network change?
Have you forwarded the ports on your router to raspberry (by default all UDP ports from 10000 to 60000 needs to be forwarded)?Is your router upnp compatible? In my understand you never forwarded ports in your router and it worked before, that's why I'm asking.First can you look on node UI to advanced setting and ensure that upnp is in first place on NAT config then look on your router if you see any opened port pointing to your node on upnp configHi,

You are right, on dark you pay what you use and can choose the node you use, the 2.0 is on a subscription model and you can only choose the country, not the node.

Two different models for two kind of people needings, go for the one you like.Hi,
Can you go to this link and try to login?
https://app.mysteriumvpn.comHi,
On settings then connexion, uncheck the ""refresh ip address"" itemThe idea if to get the same ip address on reconnect then restart the download from where he pausedHi,

Do you know the private key or seed phrase for the wallet address you used to get the 20 MYST?Good.
As you saved it just add a new wallet to trust wallet, metamask, safepal or any other software wallet compatible with polygon and during process import your wallet instead of generating a new one, you will recover your address and your funds.If you do it with docker, no it's not so heavy, a docker container just add what is not already present on the host machine, it's not a full virtual machine.Hi,
Are your two computers running the same OS and are they configured same way?Hi,

Try using another node if you use mysterium dark, this seems to be related to an unstable node on his own connection.I run a node on Linux and I can't see my grand'ma doing the same.  


With this app, running a node on a phone is simple as installing any other app. In my experience, just install, do the initial setup (very simple) and forget it, it just worksI'm a fan of the pay to go model, it's interesting to people that not use as much vpn, only to connect, like friend of mine, to is bank account.

On the other hand, I understand too that majority of users like the subscription model and unfortunately, the pay to go model doesn't seems to be be compatible with the apple store policies.

It depends on what you do, pricing for streaming, download, scrapping, etc are not the same.

You can have an idea on the official site, scroll down to calculator section :

[https://www.mysteriumvpn.com/godark](https://www.mysteriumvpn.com/godark) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/184fngp/how_much_is_a_gb_or_bandwith_on_mysterium_pay_as/kay67la/  There's no fee, you pay what you need and this amount is converted to MYST tokens at the current value. If you top-up when MYST token is low, you get more tokens. After that you pay your usage with the tokens you have, that's why it's difficult to say in money how much it cost, it's always the same amount of Myst tokens but with a token price variable as other cryptos. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/184fngp/how_much_is_a_gb_or_bandwith_on_mysterium_pay_as/kazhmvk/  Yes you can pay with card, mysterium will do the change. Only dark allow to choose the node, on mysterium 2.0 you can only choose the country. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/184fngp/how_much_is_a_gb_or_bandwith_on_mysterium_pay_as/kazmwtb/  Residential and others are clearly separated on the client, you can filter.

To see purposals you can use the discovery Api, this api is the one behind nodes list on the Mysterium client :

In three steps :

First of all check on polygonscan if you can see your tokens, if your Myst balance on polygonscan is zero, of course you can't see it on metamask. 

On metamask add the polygon mainnet network :
https://wiki.polygon.technology/docs/tools/wallets/metamask/config-polygon-on-metamask/

On metamask too, add the MYST token, you need to add it on polygon network :

GrapefruitMango23,"31 yo female here. I agree that this topic is not nearly touched upon enough given the fact that majority of us are women! I graduated in early 2022 and started working full time as a GP vet. I got pregnant a few months after starting and continued working full time. Management and staff were extremely supportive and lightened my caseload as things became harder physically. I was able to take 4-5 months of maternity leave and currently I am back at work full time. My son is about 10 months old now. He is the best thing that’s ever happened to me. 

I do agree that it slowed down my career during my time on maternity leave, but when I returned to work, I returned full force and feel that it gave me a new sense of confidence and purpose. This may differ from your experience being that I was a very fresh grad when I got pregnant with little experience out of school, but I think that you having a few years under your belt gives you an added advantage. 

Regarding whether motherhood has changed my outlook on my career and life, the answer is yes. During school and my first few months out, I was dedicated to the grind and didn’t mind staying late or putting in the extra hours. Now, I ensure that I am efficient during my day and set strict boundaries to leave work at a certain time. I still only get to see my son for about 1-2 hours when I get home to put him to bed. While this truly sucks during the workdays, I appreciate the time spent together so much more on my days off. The time feels more meaningful and I know that my son will one day understand that his mom was out there working hard for him to have a better life. 

That being said, if I had the opportunity to work part time or full time but three days a week for a similar salary, I would absolutely take it. I am interested in having more kids so we’ll see if all of this holds true! Best of luck and remember to think about the long term.","Veterinarian.

This sounds like it has less to do with you being a new grad, and more about toxic coworkers.What part of the appointment is taking you the longest?  Use your techs, depending on the tech to Dr. ratio. I don't think it is wrong to at least ask for 30 min appointments for a period of time.  You are a new grad and will go slower, and I think that can help with mentorship. I would never ever expect a new grad to do less than 30 min appointments.sounds like some bullshit to me.too many variables, but I wouldn't expect it to be great.  Not sure if you are on the owner side or the new grad, but as an owner any new grad I bring on the expectation, barring a few exceptions, is they will not be doing well with production, and will cost more money initially, as new grads are generally slower on how many patients they can see a day, as well as with surgical time.","Medical Doctor.

awfullogic,"following ! i’m a first year also interested in cardiology :)i mean, euthanizing an animal that doesn’t need to be euthanized vs doing it to end suffering is a completely different ball game. one of them is for the benefit of the animal, and one of them is for the benefit of someone else. pet euthanasias are always sad, but i can’t imagine putting down an animal that doesn’t need to be put down, especially a baby. it seems normal that would cause psychological distress, and if it didn’t i’d be concerned. and no, it’s not unprofessional to show emotion when you’re euthanizing someone’s pet, as long as it’s not to the point where it becomes about you rather than the pet owner. a lot of owners would prefer a vet who shows that they care through a little emotion vs. one who is stone-faced and emotionless.in this day and age, we have lots of in vitro models that could be used as substitutes. for human medicine, somewhere between 50-99% of animal studies fail to predict human outcomes; that doesn’t seem like high enough yield to outweigh what these animals have to go through. the euthanasia is the most peaceful part for them unfortunately. i know you said you aren’t interested in it anyway so it may be a moot point, but i just figured i’d point out that it’s not necessarily true to say lab animal usage is needed for the advancement of science.unfortunately, most meat farms are not like this, as they are giant industrial facilities that care more about production and profit than animal welfare and “reverence”. regardless, slaughterhouse workers have some of the highest rates of PTSD, anxiety, and depression. killing an animal that doesn’t want to be killed will always be psychologically distressing, regardless of how much “respect” is shown, unless you have no empathy for other living beings.not sure why you got downvoted, people don’t like to hear the truth i guess !totally agree with what everyone else is saying! the time will pass anyway, so might as well become a doctor in the meantime :) i’m 24 and just finished my first semester of vet school and most of my classmates are around 22-27, and there are lots who are older too, so you’re definitely in the majority. in terms of relationships, if i’m being honest i haven’t really had time to think about starting one! at least in the US, vet school kinda takes over your whole life, so thinking about relationships have definitely been put on the back burner for people who aren’t already in them when they start. one recommendation is to date people who are pursuing graduate school or similar degrees as well. for example i’ve been on dates with people from the medical school nearby, because they understand better than anyone that school comes first! best of luck and congratulations 🫶at my school, you have to pass each block with a 64 or higher, and usually each block has 3-4 exams + a final. if you fail, you can either take an “advancement exam” which is basically just a test on all the material and if you pass that you can progress to the next block, or you can elect to restart the block next year with the following class (i.e basically take a year off and try again).sending thoughts, prayers, and good vibes to you all 🫶 at my school we have an exam every 2 weeks and just one cumulative final at the end of each block","Veterinarian.

But I essentially have noth-the cardio iv which has a pediatric head, and a classic ii infant stethoscope.I have not used them but attended a lecture online where someone advertised their services in exactly this at the beginning of the talk. Don't have the name in front of me but if you pm me I can look laterI am a BVM&S grad. I think too much is being asked and expected.

But don't just take my word for it. If you are in the UK you are a member of the RCVS? Correct? They have a mentorship program. Reach out to your member, or if you do not have one, ask to be connected with one. See what they say.

There are also a list of day one, year one etc competencies. Or there used to be. Check that.

If it is too much for you you may need to look for another position, if your employer(s) are not listening to reason. I would not think finding a new position would be an issue.  Everywhere is hurting for vets. 

Good luck!3.5 years ago I contacted a lawyer to review mine and was told ""the ___ distance is reasonable but the duration is not..."". This would suggest to me that at least at that time it may have been enforceable.Just as an example of this, I work 8 to 6 officially at my job.

I left tonight at 10pm. Callbacks, records, patient refill requests...

I do love being a vet. And some of that is on me and better time management and record writing. But there is a lot of pressure on vets to constantly do more with less: see more patients but with less support staff to share the load. I was promised a room assistant for my full appt when I took this job. I am lucky if I get one for taking my history all day. On my own for exam and conclusions/dispensing meds etc.Honestly the difference for me is a few days of diarrhoea will not kill an animal generally.

A few days of straining to urinate/not urinating might.

I have used both as a last resort eg 10 min to close on a weekend where our ER is run so ragged they are closing periodically (eg we were told at 4pm fri dec 23 we had to provide our own coverage the 24th to 25th overnight).I use plumb online quite a bit.

However hands down as a small animal/occasional exotic practitioner, I use Vin the most.

National_Count_4916,"Mars Inc currently owns Banfield and VCA hospital chains. Petco/Petsmart are getting in on putting clinics in their stores

Both Banfield and VCA are offering $20-$50/month subscriptions to capture clientele which offer unlimited exams (not diagnostics), bi annual comprehensive exams and cleanings

They own, or long term lease free standing buildings and can equip them and staff. A typical clinic has a business manager, 1-2 vets 5-6 days a week and techs

That’s really stiff competition for a practice

elarth,"No most people love my detailed notes because it makes it easier like a year later to know what actually happened. The ppl barely documenting things make it hard for ppl to figure out the situation well into the future.No not unless a vet themselves but my experience is they usually title themselves clinic owner or medical director. Practice manager is not the go to title for vets running a clinic.Not a vet but a tech. I kind of have aimlessly shifted between strictly preventative, GP, ER, and even shelter med. Lot of them toxic in different ways, some better then others. Was fed lies and even had moments of great apathy toward my patients from burn out which I hated myself for feeling. Felt like it was mostly picking the poison you wanted to swallow. Current company I work for is tolerable and my coworkers/boss nice. I’m hoping this company’s structure becomes more the baseline because its structure is to punt the less desirable personalities out of the field. They fire toxic behavioral problem ppl regardless how much money they pull in. But I’ve been scorned before by empty promises so I’m skeptical understandably. I know others are just saying switch clinics, but this industry has a lot of growing/changes to go through. I’m not going promise it gets better because I’ve had situations where even a minor change in management in a good clinic can easily turn into a roach nest of problems. You’ve unfortunately invested a lot of money into this career I assume and the good news is it’s heavily hiring atm. So I’d adopt an attitude you don’t have to put up with bullcrap. Employers acting shitty to me these days get laughed at and I’m gone. You do have a lot of power in the current job market. I’d use it to your advantage. Will limit the toxicity you have to interact with.Depends. I saw more often doctors who wouldn’t do surgeries. Which a lot of strictly preventative care practices work out fine for.

SpicyThunderThighs,"I’m a student on the latter side of the spectrum. Racked up hundreds of surgeries and manage my own patients, even complicated cases that have bounced back from internal med. It sucks to hear the opinions of our school are overall pretty shitty.I kept getting put on shelter rotations so I’ve done well over a hundred. That being said they *STILL* pushed me to go faster. Learned a lot but damn, very stressful.Do you have a disability covered by the ADA? Legally they cannot kick you out over absence caused by health issues, what they *can* do, is potentially force you to take medical leave. However, to kick you out over a documented disability is very illegal and is something you can easily fight. I dealt with this during my first year and had to make sure I had my paperwork together and protected myself legally.I think she left me alone because she asked about my surgeries and how many I’ve done thus far and I guess she might have been lulled into a false sense of complacency because students probably shouldn’t be making this mistake by now with the amount of spays I’ve done 😔I was taught in school to use my needle drivers to slightly wiggle my knot to check its security, then clamp the tail with them so that it doesn’t go back into the body after you cut in case of oozing. That works great unless your ligature is *too* loose, then it slides right off. The vet today told me to grab the pedicle itself with forceps instead of doing that so I’ll change that moving forward. Essentially, once I cut the pedicle on the ovarian/distal side and the ovary was no longer keeping tension on the pedicle and keeping it out of the body, it immediately slipped   right through the ligature and right back into the body, leaving my needle drivers holding the then useless ligature while the pedicle steadily bled inside the abdomen. I immediately recognize the issue each time and go forth to extend the incision and correct the issue. I don’t close an abdomen unless I’m absolutely sure everything is squared away so fortunately I have never had any post op complications.I made sure I had a good amount of ligated pedicle tissue proximal to the ovary to hold onto with my forceps before removing my hemostats instead of holding onto my ligature tail and it made a HUGE world of difference. I think that was my problem. 

Thank you for the encouragement 🥹After I had to sew up the elongated incision and it took like another 30 minutes or so she seemed pretty put out about it and made some snarky comments about how she was challenging me to speed up. I also feel a lot of pressure from the surgical team and feel shitty being the “slow student” who holds up the show. But having a ligature slip off is even worse. Today was an awful day and I feel very incompetent. It sucks.After reading this comment I watched/researched the three clamp technique for hours last night and put it to use today. One thing that I realized was that I got a lot of bad advice from my initial professor, the suture tail grab thing being one example— almost all other resources I watched made it a point to specifically say *NOT* to do that. Like wtf, no wonder I was having the issue I was with the ligature getting yanked off my pedicles. I’m glad I at least got to the bottom of it and can try to move forward with practicing the three clamp technique. It was great and I felt like it had more of a “safety harness” so is much more suitable for my purposes. I did two more 50 lb fat pitties who were in heat today after multiple litters and all went well so I’m feeling a bit more hopeful that I figured out the root of my issue and learned from this experience and can be a much better surgeon/vet one day for it.Oops. Just saw this. I worked at a high volume spay and neuter clinic before and am now working at a shelter surgery hospital. 

The in heat spays are very stressful. It’s good to know I won’t be thrown stuff like this at this volume in GP.

WeaselWarrior7,"The reality is you are going into a profession that deals with problems and people. Me personally, I love pets and I'm a problem solver, so even though I hate people I love my job. Burnout IMO is largely due to the environment. If you hate your boss AND coworkers AND clients you're in for a bad time. I happen to love my bosses and coworkers, as well as my patients. Clients are hit or miss but overall I'm happy. Also you can start in gen practice and find you hate it, but go back to school for a specialty and love it. 

Pay wise.. well that depends on your loan burden, COL, specialization vs gen practice, private vs corporate etc. I worked corporate for a bit and while I was making amazing gains on my loans from the pay, my QOL was awful.

My advice is if you are overly worried about the loans vs pay gap to consider something else. I'm looking to pay off my loans in good time but I'm making lots of concessions on my personal spending for that and I have help from my spouse (who BTW makes a similar salary to me with a 4 year degree and certification vs my 8 years in higher ed). 

If this is what you genuinely want it will be worth it. You should take time in undergrad to explore options and see what speaks to you. You might find something you like better.If you're truly immersed in vetmed life now and enjoy it, then by all means go all in. I doubt you'll be disappointed. I loved every inch of my volunteer and research work before committing and to reiterate, the ONLY aspect of my job I dislike is clients. It kinda sounds like you love people and are more worried about the pay vs loan ratio. 

If that is the case I strongly recommend you try hard to get into a vet school in state so your loans are more manageable if that's your dream.

When you meet them, don't discount their valuable experience (doctors aren't the only ones who can teach), and hopefully they'll treat you well and want to see you succeed. :) Don't let the bastards get you down!Exotics Tech here!

Most reputable zoos have their own vet staff. I work at a large veterinary practice, and when zoos/aquariums DO need our facility it's usually for things like our CT or MRI machine. Or our dental equipment. They tend to show up with their own staff as well. Our exotics department (currently five doctors) doesn't really ever deal with them. If you work in a state with lenient laws then you may end up treating some ""zoo"" animals being kept as pets (not really the best thing ethically, IMO). Generally speaking, zoo and wildlife jobs pay very poorly. The best way to do both would be to join a practice as an exotics vet and probably see if you can foster relationships with local zoos, aquariums, and/or wildlife rehabs. We DO occasionally see animals such as raptors (falconry birds), exhibit animals from pet stores (have dealt with a gila monster, dart frog, and a tree monitor), and we've had a few one-off weird things (one lady has a rescue and brought in a confiscated wallaby). But if you're looking to work with larger zoo species such as giraffes, big cats, etc...you will very likely not get that opportunity in clinical practice, and likely not without becoming zoo boarded or at least having a lot of specialty internships/a residency. I know several zoo vets, and have been in the exotics field/community for over a decade.Most of the time you need to 1) be really well connected and know a lot of people already in the zoo community and 2) wait very very patiently for someone to die or retire so that a position opens up (seriously...I'm not kidding...)Have you thought about a less traditional route?

This is from AAHA's website:
'of this writing, there are 15 states in the US—including Florida, Colorado, and California—where nonveterinarians are allowed to own veterinary practices.""

I've known about this for a while because I read some articles about vet tech owned practices. Unfortunately my state doesn't allow techs to partner with vets in practice ownership, but food for thought. It would be a way for you to stay in the field, make a little more money (although low costs clinics obviously don't churn out a big profit), and not have the heavy debt associated with vet school. Food for thought!Idk if you'd be up for it, but specialty hospitals are nearly always looking for per diems. You could stay on somewhere in a per diem capacity just to keep your skills sharp and your options open. An ER shift here and there definitely flexes your medical muscles. I know a few people who are semi-retired and still do this. I also know someone who does mobile ultrasound and does per diem work to stay on top of her skill set. And yet another who does two days per week at a slower-paced GP practice and a handful of ER shifts each month when she feels like it. Just an idea!Not sure what types of species you'd like to study. I'd look up free vet tech CE. A lot of free CE online has anatomy-related topics. This website below focuses more on exotic animal anatomy, but as you can see they have a variety of free options.

https://lafeber.com/vet/?s=Anatomy

Additionally, a veterinary anatomy atlas would probably be helpful as others have suggested (and you could refer back to it as much as needed). Even my undergrad ""Animal Anatomy and Physiology"" book has some very detailed pics of the musculoskeletal system in various species. 

Good Luck!My time NOT spent in front of clients is my favorite part of work. I get to joke around with my coworkers (sometimes dark or inappropriate, but still funny). We sometimes talk about our personal lives (while doing x-rays, drawing blood, holding for ultrasound, etc.). We fall. We laugh. We get pissed on together. We jokingly punch each other. We can be blunt when we need to be. I just don't feel like any of those magical bonding moments would happen with clients always two feet away. The fact that I like and can mess with my coworkers makes the job so much more tolerable.Lafebervet is wonderful for free CE regarding exotics (both at the tech and doctor level). Also don't be afraid to ask to shadow an exotics doc for a week or so. It may not seem like long, but it'll be very enlightening. Most GPs or ER doctors who approach them as if they're a cat or a dog do them a disservice. There are so many that visit us having come from doctors who never gave them solid husbandry advice, misdiagnosed them, missed something that the species is known for having (such as dental disease in rabbits) or just inappropriate meds/therapies altogether. I understand they're ""trying"" but honestly you really have to familiarize yourself with these species just as much as you would a cat or dog if you intend to see them. There's no way to just ""casually"" treat a few exotics a year without compromising the level of care.

Examples:

1) Spoke with a lady today. Her rabbit is MORBIDLY obese. Like I'd be concerned to put it under anesthesia. She saw her other vet for 7 years. They never mentioned this, and never asked what she fed or told her that she should not be free feeding pellets OR that she should have stopped having an alfalfa-based pellet at 6 months when he matured. Also didn't tell her to spay them (they have a notoriously high incidence of metastatic repro cancer after about 4 years of age).

2) I saw a rabbit that had multiple holes in its face through our ER. Their vet was trying to ""drain"" the abscesses on its face (this is not appropriate in rabbits, their pus is solid). Did not attempt to address underlying dental issues that were causing the abscesses.

3) 10yr old African grey that had wellness exams one and off over the years with their GP. The bird ""seized"" nearly every visit. They were told it was stress. Parrots are extremely known for atherosclerosis but this was never mentioned. By the time it had ""the big one"" (the stroke that finally brought it in through ER as opposed to the more minor ones it was having while hypertensive during handling events)...it's vasculature on radiographs looked AWFUL. It died in hospital. It's possible that sooner therapy and recognition would have helped.

4) Every decrepit reptile that's ever been seen by someone who doesn't know reptiles well and arrives drier than a raisin in the Sahara because not one vet told them that reptiles take up most of their hydration through their vent and actually need to be physically soaked in water. Seriously the amount of things that come in for kidney failure because they've spent their whole life dry. So sad.

5) 2 year old snake that had an under tank heater. Was seen elsewhere. Owners were told that the funny looking patch on its belly was just a ""rough shed"" by an RDVM. It came in approximately two days later for ""not eating"". This was because it wasn't a rough shed. It had third degree burns along the ventrum because O's hadn't placed the under tank heat far enough from the glass, and the snake was a burrowing species.

I encourage you to try and help the exotics nuggets as much as possible, but learn from some solid people and really put in the time to do your CE so you can provide the best care possible!Idk where you live but in the greater New York Metro area 100k (assuming you are a single person or want to live alone) won't actually get you that far. Especially when you factor in the massive crippling debt of payments most post-grads are stuck with. I only did undergrad and if I hadn't consolidated my payments I would've owed 800/month. Also rent near where I live is running like 2k even for the crap places right now. 100k truthfully isn't ""a lot of money"" anymore. I actually know several vets to have side jobs or work more than one clinic. Or pick up per diem shifts for extra pay. Welcome to inflation.Honestly it depends on how important experiencing another culture is to you. You may not get the chance to live in another country again, and that can be a valuable experience. Personally for me living abroad isn't something I really prioritized. And as someone who racked up a LOT of debt for just my undergrad degree (and is going to be paying it off until I die)...I'd legit go with whatever school is cheaper. Debt really negatively impacts your life, especially your life as a young adult who's just graduated. Having heftier school loan payments may severely limit the types of jobs you're able to take (it did for me). I ended up having to turn down several dream jobs because they just didn't pay well enough for me to break even with my loans. I'm pretty happy now, but my debt level caused me to do a great deal of settling when it came to my career options. If you had any inkling to want to try general practice, shelter care, nonprofit work, zoo vet, wildlife center, etc... those don't necessarily make the big bucks. When I was young I went to the higher priced dream school, and really wish I hadn't. Of course, this is you we're talking about, not me. Just offering one perspective.Don't stay there too long. You're still just out of school (2 years is NOT long). You need a place that'll challenge you to grow in your medical knowledge, and will allow you to find *your* way of practicing medicine that is up to your standards. Maybe consider taking a year or two to do ER in a specialty practice. That's the type of environment I work in as a Tech. It can be tough, but it makes for some REALLY clinically well-rounded doctors and nurses.

I'd never go back to GP. And honestly I've seen a lot of cases that have been mismanaged (to the point of malpractice) by people working in clinics that practice what we call ""old medicine"". These types of places don't tend to be big on fully utilizing all of the diagnostics, don't have high standards of care for things like sedation/anesthesia (YES an OHE should be intubated, always), tend to have doctors that ONLY feel comfortable recommending drugs that have been used for decades, and often have lost their passion when it comes to themselves and their staff keeping up on current CE/innovations in the field. Sounds like you may be in one such place. I'm in an environment where most of the techs know how to interpret bloodwork, manage DKAs, do complex wound care, run a code, spot and identify arrhythmias, etc. Even for our exotics, we intubate almost everything and do preventive bloodwork. Imagine what you could learn, and what you could be allowed to do if you worked with a team that all strived for a higher standard of care. Best of luck!","Veterinarian.

sardonicwit,"TAMU vet student here. I'm going to echo what everyone else here has said - no amount of experience in the veterinary field is going to make up for a subpar GPA in admission's eyes. Struggling financially for a few years while you try to apply isn't going to help you in any sense - getting into vet school, getting in a better financial situation, preserving your mental health. It also isn't going to change anything about your application from year to year except that your experience hours will go up, which probably doesn't buy you anything - I suspect that you already have enough experience there that they'll give you sufficient ""points"" in that category as it is.

I'd definitely look for ways to address the GPA issue. What your GPA actually looks like and where you want to apply will probably direct the way you can most effectively do that, but you want to at least consider some possibilities there.

But I'd also give serious thought to changing jobs. Either work as a tech somewhere else if you're able to get a greater diversity of experience that way (say, going from a small animal clinic to one that does production animals/horses/exotics/something else), or change careers entirely. Vet med is primarily a business involving people, so anything that broadens your experience with business and/or people is incredibly valuable in an applicant, even if it isn't vet-related. It also makes you stand out against the thousands of applicants they get from adequate-to-good students who've spent years working as techs.

No need to continue to suffer just to pursue this dream. I really think broadening your horizons can help you both in your day-to-day life AND in your vet school applications.","Veterinarian Student.

Asleep_Leopard182,"I can't help with the first bit - as I'm sure there are plenty of others more qualified than myself to provide better advice here.  


However, with the second half around surgeons.  
My best advice here is to come from their position & understanding, and meet that in your advance and behaviour. Being surgeons - they've gone through (likely) a Bachelors, then a 4 year Doctorate, then a 1+ year internship, a 4 year residency, and then spent X number of years in a specialisation. When you have that much education under your belt, sometimes things can seem obvious, or are natural to you (from practice and/or also being held to certain standards), that are not obvious or natural to others, particularly vet nurses, and hospital orderlies (which where I am, can exist from zero formal education, through to bachelors in general surgery), which even at the highest form of training, is about 9 years of education & specificity below that of the surgeon.  


Knowing basic things, being able to predict what comes next, being able to notice the small things, and being consistent & solid in your approach. If they ask for tape - ensuring the tape is the correct length for whatever they're planning to do. Know procedures, so when they ask for suture, you don't have to ask which one (unless it's weird, and alternative & needs a double check - in which case make it clear it's double checking).   


In my experience working with surgeons, it's less so that they're directly aggressive, but it is that they want quality work, to meet the standards they have set not only for you, but for themselves. When they are trying to do complex things, they don't want to have to be worrying about how or who is holding an animal.  


That doesn't excuse the relatively common behaviour of being a stick of dynamite behind the scenes (in which case, I just say move practices - it's not your job to fix them), particularly to those in training - however, ensuring that you are thorough and thoughtful in and about your job should show through. Keep in mind they've probably stood where you're standing at some point, quite a few vets started as vet nurses (and have hours in the job), and it can get very frustrating very quickly if you have to think for two, instead of one (particularly on the basics), particularly if it is the basics they're working on.Full disclosure, am vet student, not vet nurse - but these are the areas that I regularly poke and see what falls out.

\- Depending on where you got your certification, you can often access library memberships as an alumnus. They will have a wealth of stuff that you can use.

\- Googling vet tech CPD and/or continuing education should yield more results than I can provide- Instagram, I follow a few vet techs & vets on there that post interesting cases (doesn't qualify for CPD, but it helps me expand knowledge).

\- If you are registered, your registrar should also have access to databases with your membership. If you have a topic of interest - throw it into google scholar, see what comes up.

\- Doing smaller side-courses, if you're not already a registered RVT, then doing that as an upskill, or even going on to do further vocational training in specialised areas can be relatively short in duration, but very good for further understanding. 

\- If you don't see yourself returning to practice any time soon, looking at Bachelors in the area 

\- Science, Animal Science, Nutrition, Biology, Biochemistry, Animal Behaviour, and so forth can really open up and broaden understanding. Quite a few uni's actually release their courses (without the certification at the end) to the public, which you may find useful to go through.

\- There are also plenty of areas that are available for free - Osmosis (through data bases), Youtube - Khan Academy, Ninja Nerd, Crash Course. Outside of this - Anki, textbooks, and just sourcing general stuff. Ninja Nerd actually goes nearly to the full depth of my degree itself when it comes to bio knowledge. It can't teach you to vet, but it can teach you the underlying bioscience to a well and truly solid level. We do go a little further (dysfunction, changes in dysfunction and so forth, before heading to diagnostics & treatment), but it will give you the in-health level.

E: Someone else also mentioned VIN - which absolutely as well. They provide free access if you're in a related course of study too, which depending on where you are in the world, can include online self-paced courses. Just a tid bit.I double this

There will also be emails and other methods of communication with the advisory team that don’t require in-person contact.

We just went through an accreditation, and as well as having student boards, open hours, and walk-through, there were other methods of anonymous (which you could double up by using a second/throwaway email and so forth) communication.There is definitely a place for you in vet med. However, only you can make the decision of whether or not you are happy to take up that place. There are plenty of more direct, less enduring careers that may make you as happy - and it's ok to ask if vet is worth it.  


Without even getting into specifics - vet med is short of everything, everywhere at the moment. Every vet student counts in building back up numbers, and restoring staffing shortages. The numbers shortage is so critical that even areas such as governmental departments are facing shortages - let alone more complex/demanding fields such as research or pathology.  
Vet school also does tend to have a narrow field of view too in my experience, where people are boxed into ""largies"" and ""smallies"". Half the people who answer are just answering for the sake of it. Others are genuine in their interest. Good chance a 2/3 also have no idea what is available outside those answers. It can often make it seem pretty naive, or simple - leaving you questioning if you're overthinking things. You're not - you've just got a different perspective you can bring to the table.  


I would also reassess whether or not you are burnt out - vet school is not easy, it's not well balanced and you're often left questioning things, even if you can't see an issue. It's partially the nature of it. It's such a demanding degree, that has such a high requirement of people in order to complete.   


I also want to mention the general toxicity that is veterinary hospitals - and for some reason, university hospitals. So many are just straight up horrible places to be. So much so if you scroll down on here it's a regular post from people actively doing placements from within them. It seems to be a shared item too, even from people who haven't actively posted. Every vet seems to have a story about someone who would just casually lose their temper (or be a narcissistic egotistical asshole), within a hospital placement. I can't answer to why, but residents are often the bottom of the trough to begin with relating to work (unfortunately), I'm willing to bet they're feeling it and passing it onto the students.What stage of education are you at?Can you look elsewhere? What are your chances of getting into vet school in reality? (have you completed dip/bach/mast, research, other hours? other experience? local vet schools?)

It might sound backwards, but I worked hospitality up and am still in it whilst in Vet school.Use your hours and your time wisely. A higher wage opens up hours if you stay on the same total yearly income. It opens up time - which you can then use to diversify. Increased diversity also allows opening up opportunities outside of s/n.

Spay & neuter is good, I won't lie, but you need more than that to get into vet school, and you need more than that to eventually do it well. It's OK to do 37-40h a week, but diversify.

Being that you do 37-40h, I'm assuming you're not in continuing education too? Which again, can be another consideration on things. Vet schools will not look badly IF you have a continuing education with a non-industry related job.  


E: I Just want to add too, S/N tend to be community programs, so do tend to be low paid, low diversity, low growth jobs - these are good entry level positions, but if you want to get into vet school looking beyond this is necessary to an extent. They want well rounded candidates that are aware of the stresses & effort the field demands - this is part of the reason behind things like hours, research, and so forth. They want candidates that are already actively participating, and are not only educated but aware of the efforts it requires. Yes, S/N is good as it's high volume work - good hours, good surgical exposure, but it's only one area of a multifaceted profession.A couple of things to consider  


\- As WeaselWarrior said, if you're fine with the aspects of problems & people - then you're probably fine. However, it is a large financial burden to take on. It's worth looking internationally at what is available, and where you would like to be. I also would look to where you're at, and look at how much you're involved with the medicine side of things, and see where you feel you stand with that - veterinary is literally medical, and one thing that I wasn't exposed to as much as other areas was how medical it would be (I don't have a problem with that & is one of those areas that I love - but it can shock people & be one of the main reasons of dropping out for those who don't get that experience prior).  


If you can, get experience (even just shadowing) in a clinic, and get a really good look at the life. Really go for it, and see. However, at the end of the day completing a DVM is different living in the profession.  
The other thing I thought through when I looked at doing my degree (internationally accredited DVM) was, if I were to leave the profession where would my DVM get me, versus other avenues. With my DVM, I can move laterally into research, I can take on governmental jobs, move internationally, continue through to residencies & specialisation, I can move into advisory roles and so forth. I could also move into areas that would be classically covered by a JD/business degree too (I'm Aussie - so it's a bit easier here). I can't do that with a PhD in some niche, or a second bachelors. Is it perhaps what I want? Not necessarily right now, but as an option for a parachute, you can't deny it's style with versatility.  


There's also nothing saying you can't do coding on the side - the biggest difference between my life pre-DVM and now is that my side hustles and hobbies were TO get into the DVM. I was also doing stupid hours on stupid hours volunteering, finding anything to get experience for the DVM. Now I'm there - I have time to do other things (sometimes!!), such as learning to invest on the stock market, and am now playing with shorts on sim. Once you're a vet, you may have time to do other things. There is a hustle culture in veterinary so this may get backlash - but at the end of the day, as a vet - you don't need to do that internship/specialisation, you don't necessarily need to constantly look at other things, you can walk away at the end of your shift and do something else. The time that is now spent non-degree working, that's ""free time"" once you're a vet. You can do something else there. Add in some of the recent improvements in compensation and if you were willing to stay in your current lifestyle, you could probably do a degree on the side (if you can get into a DVM, you can do another bach).  


It could be worth chatting with a uni careers advisor, or a counsellor too - to get an impartial opinion. Not family, not friends, not other vets (all a mixed bag, but none unbiased).If you like shadowing, then you should be pretty right for the job itself. Particularly if there's few limitations to what you currently do/see/participate in.  


The one thing I would absolutely stress, to both yourself and anyone reading this - is even when in vet med, don't give up your hobbies. Yes, it demands so much but I think one of the biggest problems at the moment in the industry is people forget it is a job - not a lifestyle. I'm only a vet student, but we are constantly drilled to have other hobbies & passions, and life outside the course. It's easy to slip up and turn 100% med, but to have that option & outlet is crucial as it makes a huge difference to QOL. I also know I'm not alone in this opinion, and not alone in sectioning off time to work on hobbies & external interests.  
One of the areas vet med lacks too is proper IT and streamlining programs, so who knows - you may be able to use those skills more readily than what you think.  


Definitely chat with as many people as you can, particularly those ""knowing"" the industry, but not fully in it. Get as many opinions, then sort through them. You don't have to listen to them, but use them as thought & planning seeds.  


I can't answer for US college fees - again I'm Aussie - and I was lucky enough to do both my degrees CSP, with a bursary from one uni, and a couple of other things thrown in (and with a steady well paying job in hospo that compliments hours that I've worked up to senior positions), but all I can say is do the math, look at everything that is available, and see where to go. Not so much ""do your own research"" but do the footwork, make contacts, and research inside and out then get advice from that. I'm not the first person in my family to get tertiary study, but I am the first to go to this extent with Bachelors/doctorates/masters, etc. - and having supports makes a huge amount of difference, even if they aren't necessarily family/friends.  
I don't know the average cost of a degree in the US, nor what else is available to you, but I also would stress to look at scholarships and what it would take to get things such as partial or majority $$ paid for (including international). I would also crunch average salaries, and see how much financially it would take - and if it would be worth it. I would however stress not to auto-fall back on coding, as at the moment they can be hit & miss with workforce supply, and it's as much connections due to being a relatively limited industry (every industry has it's warts).  
It could be worth making connections in subs & in person at uni's you're looking at targeting too, even heading in and seeing what people suggest in regards to scholarships and such.

Zebrasoma,"IMO having worked for a GP who did a lot for the community like that you are unfortunately inviting a lot of problems when you offer credit arrangements and cheap to free vaccine clinics. It devalues the rest of your services and invites a certain type of client. Why would someone pay full price for a vaccine if they can wait till the free clinic? Why would someone pay their bill if they know a credit program exist? When we raised prices to just cover the cost of the supplies people lost their minds. It’s just a harsh reality of the field, people suck and will take advantage of a good thing. That’s why these models of petco vet clinic things work. There are certainly the subset of people who could pay if they would but it’s not the majority. 

I don’t think it’s bad, but even though I want to do good in the world I would have no interest in a job like that because I’ve seen the reality. It would have to be very well run to avoid the pitfalls of barely staying above water and so perhaps it’s worth highlighting that in the job description somehow. Just highlighting all the fluffy things you do may strike concern.   

And as an aside there is a subset of vets (I am one of them) who are not supportive of TNR. We even went over it in school as a debate topic because it’s controversial. There is minimal evidence it’s a good long term control method and it leads to worse outcomes for wildlife and for cats. I would not want to fight that battle with an owner and perhaps new grads feel the same.You’re not wrong but…I feel like in the non profit world there is so much wrong with the vet situation. Most zoo vets are making 80-100k (some less!!) even when you’re in a major metropolitan city. It’s outrageous.They’re not and that’s the problem. Look at Arizona’s program. It’s several years in with no teaching hospital and is possibly going to lose accreditation. In theory the model sounds nice, practical experience etc but in actuality you have no way to ensure those experiences result in successful students. They’re just putting the burden on local practices to shoulder the cost and that’s another issue entirely.Grossly sure, but what about net?Do you use hemo clips or just cautery with chinchillas? The lack of ability to get good visualization with the ovaries makes hemoclips an appealing idea. I’ve been using a ligasure or regular cautery but doing it alone with 1000ft of intestines and cecum in the way is annoying.We had the fear of god struck into us about catgut in school. You’re a brave soul spaying a dog.Haha what a lovely pun. I know people do use it but it was one of those if you use it and something goes wrong you’ll be sued because it’s not an “appropriate choice” anymore basically due to it’s lack of reliable breakdown.I mean if you’re already a 4th year not aware that it matters you’re gonna have a bad time…","Veterinarian.

How much of that money is still there?   


Would love to see some transparency and future plans how those funds will be used to support Mysterium. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlwo91f/  Could you please explain the MYST token metrics and how it will get value?

I would like to thank you for setting up this AMA. My congratulations to you and the team, you all have been working very hard over the past years. The application is great and I’m excited for what the future will bring. Keep it up!

I do have some questions, hope you don't mind me asking.  
 

**Team:**  


* Can you tell us something about the team? How many people are currently working at Mysterium?  
 

**Community:**  


* Do you think the community members and backers of Mysterium are important and why?
* How do you think Mysterium can improve to get the community more involved? 

  
**Networking:**  
Mysterium was on the foreground raising awareness in the Ethereum community by building this important piece of tech, a decentralized VPN network. After the fundraising Mysterium went mysteriously quiet. Nowadays, barely anyone from the Ethereum community or the Web3foundation knows about you guys. Which is sad because many of them are located in Berlin where Mysterium is based as well.

I remember Robert visited Devcon a few years ago in Cancun. The other Devcons, ETHBerlin, DAPPcon…. You guys were just not there.  
 

* Is there any particular reason why Mysterium stays absent at major, important events?
* And do you think it should be improved and how?
* Do you think networking is important?

**Tokenomics:**

As far as I know, the decision making about what role MYST tokens have inside Mysterium mainly took place internally in the team. The community was never involved.   


* What different token models did you explore or study?
* How do you think the current model will create value for MYST?
* Will MYST tokens have a governance role in the future?
* Did you explore any staking contract models?   
For example, where every MYST token transaction pays a tiny amount of fee to a staking contract. The one who stakes more is collecting more fees.
* Will Mysterium create a MYST liquidity pool on Uniswap in the future? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/gc3zxw/ama_jaro_šatkevic_head_of_product_9_am_est_5th/fpjlt4h/","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment does not provide any information related to medical or veterinary practice, making it impossible to determine the profession of",Medical Doctor

I was already in college but fooled around because I really didn't know what to do with my life prior - was just in college because my parents made me (and I'm thankful now for that). Graduated with a BS (as a backup) in 2018 and didn't get in my first try so I worked as a tech at a clinic (don't need to be licensed in my state) for that year.

Got accepted my 2nd try. Graduated in 2023. 

I originally wanted to specialize but realized the 1-year internship (minimum) and 3-year residency with likely < 50k per year pay just wasn't for me. I told myself if I'm still passionate about the specialty in a few years, maybe I'll revisit it.

MiamiShuff,"A bird in hand is worth 2 in the bush.  If you weren’t going to accept a seat at that school then why apply in the first place?

The debt is a very understandable concern but if you’re disciplined and don’t have other outrageous debt it is very manageableI’m a current 4th year and I will be going into ER straight out of school.  I’m doing VEG’s ER training program.  Feel free to message me with questions about itSo in my opinion, most criticism from people who don’t like VEG can’t stand the open concept idea or think VEG people act weird on tiktok (which is honestly true.  I personally hate social media).  As far as their medicine I’m a firm believer in the quality of your medicine being as good as YOU want it to be.  Quality of medicine is much more heavily influenced by a doctors desire to constantly learn and grow rather than lean into complacency.  As far as training to be an ER doctor I don’t think the gap between the VEG training and a traditional internship is much different.  I say that coming from spending about 10 total weeks at a few different well known internship locations paired with 6 weeks at two separate VEG locations.  I’ve seen interns mess up many cases in my vet school and its part of growing.  That’s going to be EVERY training program you see and you will not be perfect no matter what route you choose.  But I liked that VEG’s training program has dedicated journal rounds every week with specialists during your training, CE for ultrasound so you can gain confidence on your FAST scans, and surgical training and anatomy refreshers during your training in the VEG program.  In my opinion many of the complainers with VEG have valid complaints when it comes to VEG draining the owners of money before referrel or reaching an incorrect diagnosis.  I say this to say I would love for any ER doctor to be perfect with their diagnosis and plan.  Then specialty wouldn’t exist….  I do think VEG’s policy on “we find a way to say yes” can be twisted into them not referring until too late.  In my opinion, as an ER doctor, knowing when to refer is a skill in itself.  I think so much gets forgotten on what the purpose of an ER doctor is and VEG is just so in your face that they get a lot of the criticism for problems that are common in many ERs.  Just my opinion.

That said I understand the social media craze and cult like culture with them.  That can definitely be overwhelming if its not your vibe but overall I think their medicine and training is good quality which is why I decided to do their training over a traditional internship or any of the other fast track ER programs.Regardless of the path you choose, if you are unhappy with where you end up you can always pivot another direction/place.  Your head is in the right place and you’re gonna be a great doctor!I would spend a few weeks shadowing your vet before making any commitments to the profession.  There are many ways to help animals outside of being a veterinarianExactly this.  I didn’t even have a SINGLE radiograph on my exam.  What the fuck.  I didn’t have a question on cushings or diabetes either.  But of course I had a question asking what the most appropriate way to dispose of a syringe was after giving a DHPP vaccine was……This is what’s giving me major anxiety right nowI passed!  Much higher than my IVCA practice exam scoresFollowing this as wellYup that’s me, I’m getting shitfaced and crying regardless of the outcomeCongratulations Dr!!!I’m sure you killed it!My practice exams had me on the high range of 420.  I scored 472 on the actual examI have accepted my spot in the NERD program with VEG but I feel like I did extensive research about all my options.  I’m not going to lie, I eliminated the BluePearl emERge program pretty quickly due to their manipulative and vague contracts.  Speaking with a representative of the company and talking about the program there is a 2 year commitment to BluePearl after the training year (so 3 years total).  There is also no room for negotiation with your salary during that time and the salary is “a competitive ER doctor salary”.  So no guarantees on your financial numbers, no guarantees on your training, no guarantees on whether or not the hospital you get placed at has willing mentors.  I personally think BluePearl is a mess.  Now this was during my 2nd year so the program may be slightly different now, but I was so turned off after speaking with the rep and seeing the structure of the program that I just eliminated for myself at that point. The huge added benefit of course is having specialty available for you to lean on which is gonna be huge when you are getting started and when you have more complex cases.  Of course people are also recommending the internship route but if you don’t have plans of specializing then imo its not financially wise when the opportunities out there are just so much better.  Also if you want surgical experience, it is basically non existent as a rotating intern.

I chose the NERD program because the 6 month program is similar to an internship in regards to the workload.  You will definitely be working like an intern those first 6 months.  You have 3-4 12 hour shifts each week + 1 didactic day a week + journal clubs.  All that and the pay is 40k for that 6 month period.  In my opinion, the VEG NERD program is like an internship where you don’t rotate through specialty.  Most internships are 1 year long with roughly 50% ER and 50% rotations through the different services in the hospital.  I liked that the VEG Program sends you to a specific ultrasound training course, anatomy and surgery CE, and didactic rounds are taught by boarded specialists.  You’ll see a lot of comments about how VEG botches so many cases and sends everything to referral anyway.  I do think VEG is incredibly expensive and it is sad when docs at VEG use all the clients funding trying to figure something out before going to specialty.  That’s not the doctor I want to be and I think working ER and learning when to refer is a genuine skill learned over time.  There is also NVA mentorship programs that are more hospital specific and require more leg work to find if they are the right fit for you.  Honestly that leg work is worth it when finding your fit because that first year out of school is so important.

This is my experience and I’m happy to chat with anyone more extensively if they would like.  It was a daunting task trying to decide my path and I was very close to accepting an internship outside the match vs the VEG NERD program.So after the 6 month program you are looking at signing a completely different contract since the NERD program and actually working at VEG after training are separate things.  I get a $2000 bonus for accepting the NERD position and $4000 to relocate.  After that the anticipated salary after completion of training if I decide to stay on is 140,000 or 22% production (whichever is higher)","Medical Doctor.

Hotsaucex11,"You could check out Avian and Exotic Animal Care in Raleigh, NC. Exotics practice that hosts externs, wouldn't be too far a drive for you.No, but the grass is always greener and people love to complain on the web. Go to virtually any job sub and you'll see plenty of complaints.In the US a doctorate is required for any practicing veterinarian, so typically 4 years of undergraduate education, then 4 years of veterinary specific doctorate program. 

After completing that doctorate a veterinarian can go straight into various forms of practice, the most common being dog/cat GP, but also including large/farm animal, equine, and emergency. Or they can take additional time to do residency/internship programs that allow them to specialize in a narrower aspect of the field. 

In the US there was a huge spike in demand for veterinary services during Covid, which has resulted in a general shortage of vets that still persists now, so we aren't concerned about saturation at this point.Subside? Yes. Go away entirely? Not really, at least among the people I know well. 

That being said, you definitely aren't being set up to succeed in an environment with such minimal mentorship. It is worth discussing this with your boss to see if they can set up the schedule such that you have more support. If they can't you should consider going somewhere that can provide it.I mean that sentiment among staff isn't uncommon, they know a new vet is going to need some time to get their sea legs. But some of those comments are way out of line:

 “I’m sure one day, a long time from now, you’ll be good at surgery… but until then you’re not practicing on my animal”

“no offense you really don’t do well with any sick animal”

If I found out a staff member was saying things like that to someone else on the team then they would be getting written up, then fired if it happened again. That isn't normal or a you thing, that's someone being a toxic bully.I'm really sorry you are going through that. I would certainly recommend bringing these concerns, with those specific examples to your medical director and/or practice manager. Hopefully they will help, if not then you should look for a more supportive practice. It is absolutely normal for new grads to bounce around a couple of practices before finding one that is a great fit for them, so don't think of this as a mark against you.I wouldn't let the financial stuff deter you. Income-adjusted federal student loan repayment programs and/or in-state tuition make it doable even if you don't come from money. Plus salaries for new grads have sky-rocketed over the past 10 years. 

Every working vet I know is doing at least OK financially, most better than that. They own cars/houses and indulge in plenty of nonessential hobbies/travel/dining/etc regularly. Put it this way, it seems like the vets I know are doing better than the average person I know on that front.Never hurts to try, but I wouldn't expect much success via linked in if you are reaching out to vets you don't know. Ideally you want to try and use existing contacts to get a foot in the door. Approaching those that work with the rescue you volunteer at is a perfect opportunity. If you don't feel comfortable approaching them directly then see if you can get their email addresses from your coordinator to reach out that way (but in-person would be ideal!).

I would try to shadow for longer as that's going to give you a better shot at getting a quality letter of recommendation.How would becoming a partner solve your problem? If the clinic isn't busy/big enough to support you I don't see how being a partner changes that.>I've never been interested in owning a practice because I really value being able to leave work at work

Gotcha, that makes sense. Then the real issue is the above. As a significant partner (not just like a 5-10% stake) you are definitely signing up to have work be a bigger (and much more stressful) aspect of your life. Personally I enjoy it and think the tradeoffs are worth it, especially with the financial upside, but it sounds like it might not be for you.""I've seen most vets complex appointments super fast""

Where?

In my experience the places with 20 minute appointments are doing mostly routine/wellness work unless they have exceptional technician support or interns to help manage cases.You can definitely find roles where there will be some overlap in species you see between traditional small companion exotics and traditional zoo species. But you'll really need to pick a path and focus on one or the other as your primary, it would be very unusual to end up in a 50-50 situation.

I'm in an exotics specialty practice and while we do get to see some ""zoo species"" for smaller zoo/rescue/sanctuaries or individuals, it is a tiny % of our caseload (like 2% maybe).Worth it? Maybe, really depends on you, the price, and the situation.

Overall I think yes, it is often a good long term financial decision to find a way to work for yourself, whether that's through full or partial ownership. You have far higher financial upside that way than you do as an associate. So the big question there is whether you want the added work/stress that comes with ownership.

Thinking about this specific situation:

That 10-15m valuation seems really high for a 5m gross practice, do you know where they got that number? I know multiples were getting crazy a couple of years ago from the corporate buying groups, but those days are gone, so your current PO might have unrealistic expectations.

4-5 partners is a lot to deal with and a lot of potential headache on top of normal ownership. I personally wouldn't do that unless I was getting a controlling share, or someone I really believed in was. I wouldn't want to be in a spot where we all own 20% or 25% and decision making is a clusterfuck, unless you REALLY trust and are aligned with every one of them.A) listen to this person!

B) agreed 100% that going into relief as a new grad is not a good ideaSalary = your guaranteed yearly pay, typically divided/paid out every two weeks


Production = How much revenue your produce for the hospital through your work


Making production pay = A percentage of your total production that is paid to you as a bonus, sometimes paid monthly/quarterly/yearly. This is only earned once you've generated more than your salary would account for.


For example, let's say a job listing said they would pay you 100,000 usd/yr, plus 20% production. What they mean is that you'll get 100,000 usd guaranteed per year in salary, then once you've generated over 500,000 usd in revenue (or the equivalent adjusted amount per month/quarter) you will start getting paid 20% of any further revenue as a bonus. (500,000 bc 20% of it = 100,000)You're welcome, and good luck!Great write-up and all true!

I just helped in designing/implementing a new internship program in my practice and the experience confirmed a lot of what you talked about. One thing that really struck me hardest was the need for me to constantly push back against the ""well I had to do it so..."" mentality from colleagues. One colleague in particular is an absolute staff/client favorite, great emotional intelligence, so supportive of others and prioritizing mental health...but they went through a very challenging post-grad process so it really warped their view of what was fair to expect of an intern.I wouldn't worry about the pay difference, I know it seems like a lot now but it will be pretty meaningless in the long run vs finding a practice that sets you up for success in terms of mentorship/training/opportunity. 

That being said, your concerns are totally valid. I would apply and if they are interested in an interview then see if they'll fly you out (or at least pay part of the cost for it) so that you can get a better gauge of the situation in-person. Sounds like there are other practices in the area you could interview at at the same time, so I'm SURE you could get at least one of them to cover a trip out there.I have a close friend who went from finance to vet med. Made great money in finance, but found it really unrewarding. Now she's coming full circle and after working as an associate for a while she's opening her own practice and getting to put some of that business knowledge to use again.

In terms of getting your prereqs done you'll have to check with Purdue, different schools have different requirements in terms of the timing/conditions for prereqs to be accepted.Yeah, calculating expenses piecemeal like that is a pain in the ass and going to be very difficult to pin down. So I'd try to approach it a little differently:

What is your typical margin or net for your routine practice aside from these specialist services? Like if the practice grosses 5 million, how much is leftover in revenue for ownership after all of the bills/staff/etc are paid?  

Lets just use 10% as an example for that net revenue to make for an easy hypothetical. Then lets assume your total compensation for your associate vets is around 25%, as that's easy to use and pretty typical. So that totals 35%, meaning your expenses for everything else (staff, cogs, building, insurance, etc) equal about 65% of your gross revenue, or put another way, for every one dollar you take in, about $0.65 is going back out for your non-veterinary expenses. 

Take that example, plug your numbers in, and you should get a good approximation of what your expenses are in a way that's useful in considering how to set this up. On the surface I'll say that it looks like you are taking WAY too little for this to be a good setup for the practice, as in most practices you'd need to be getting at least 50% of that revenue just to break even on the expenses, probably more. But beyond the surface it does get situation specific in terms of how to structure the deal, as there are going to be aspects of it that will be hard to capture in definite numbers. What happens if you drive a hard bargain and they leave? Is their service being a part of your practice bringing in extra revenue elsewhere?

If your major costs are relatively fixed (i.e. them leaving wouldn't mean you getting to significantly cut building/staff/COGs costs) AND you don't think you will be able to find a replacement, then it might make financial sense to go along with even this relatively bad arrangement, at least until you can recruit a replacement.I'm assuming OP meant gross.It really does depend on your state board's guidance and the circumstances. In this case you'd probably be fine so long as there are other practices nearby that would be viable options for the client.Sure! The corporate structure that can be frustrating for some vets can be a boon for new grads. Yes, you'll be practicing ""cookie-cutter"" medicine for the most part, and doing lots of routine stuff, but in your first couple of years practicing that's not necessarily a bad thing. 

Beyond that it really just depends on the location in terms of what your experience will be like. If you have a great medical director running yours then you'll probably have a good experience as a new grad.Dr. Name especially as a new grad, where you want to reinforce the dr part with clients/staff as much as possible.

But really you should hold off, as clinics sometimes provide this stuff for you and/or will have requirements for them.I've had to give that feedback to a couple of receptionists who were spending 10+ minutes on a single com note, causing them to neglect other more pressing duties.

For them it wasn't about cutting detail, it was about being more concise in their note taking and them understanding that taking that long on a single note was an indulgence we didn't have time for. I could show them how they were writing multiple long paragraphs when they could convey the same info with half the words/time.

In your case it would be completely reasonable to ask for some further training/guidance/examples to work from.A couple of possibilities come to mind:

\- You aren't documenting your recommendations effectively. Ideally you want to have them in your estimates and be able to mark them as declined, giving you and the practice a clear record of what was recommended.

\- You aren't covering these things as well as you think and your techs/assistants have raised concerns to management.Honestly the stuff you are worried about negotiating isn't nearly as big of a deal as it seems to you right now. Yeah, you might leave a few thousand on the table, or miss on a benefit or something, ultimately you'll never really know on that front and it will really seem like a drop in the bucket big picture. But really your first couple of years will be about learning and developing, and finding the right place for that will have a FAR bigger impact on your long term earnings than what you negotiate in that initial contract. If you can develop into a strong vet then the money will follow, whether it is at your first job or the next. 

Unless...you sign some kind of really terrible/punitive long term contract. So that is really the one thing I would focus on avoiding/negotiating. Most vets don't stay at their first clinic for very long and you really don't want to end up feeling stuck somewhere. So try to avoid signing anything beyond a one-year commitment, and if you take a big signing bonus be very careful about the fine print and repayment terms if you leave the position ""early"" (which can be up to 5 years in for some of the bigger bonuses).We host interns and do consider GPA, but I would agree with the person who told you that LoRs are more valuable. If you have a strong LoR from someone we trust that is going to really set you apart and more than make up for a medium GPA.Technically any vet can see either type without any specialization. Now should they based on training from vet school alone? Probably not. 

But yes, if you become a board certified avian specialist you will be well equipped to see both types.FWIW one of the best overall vets I know was a C student in high school and literally told she wasn't college material by her guidance councilor. Now she's a board certified specialist who owns/runs a nationally known specialty practice and gets flown around the country to speak at conferences. 

How ""smart"" you are has SO much less to do with your success than you think it will. Your work ethic and pure grit will have FAR more impact on how far you go.I see three possible causes:

\#1 is that it is a holdover from the recent past, when new grads making 6 figures was very unusual. Vet associate pay has sky-rocketed over the past 5 years, and the most recent figure showed new grads starting at an average of about 130k/yr. Vets being underpaid is something that people have thought/talked about for a long time, and many haven't adjusted those thoughts to the new reality. 

\#2 is that vets compare themselves to human doctors, who tend to make a lot more despite similar schooling. It is a natural comparison to make if you are looking for a reason to complain, even though ultimately they work in two very distinct ecosystems.

\#3 is that cost of education has also risen significantly, which combined with general economic inflation means that even starting out making 6+ figures a new grad may still be feeling a lot of financial strain. 

All of that being said, I do generally agree with you. The vets I know all live solid middle-class lifestyles, or better in some cases, in an age when it is becoming harder and harder to do that in the US. They own decent homes/cars and still have plenty of funds for travel/fun.Interesting. I'd say 100k is low if anything, at least after sign-on/production bonuses.Who is to say what is fair? Vets tend to cherry pick comparisons that allow them to continue painting themselves as the victims, as underpaid. But in reality it is extremely subjective, and not really helpful to compare across different professions/industries in a search for fairness. 

How about the vet tech with a 4 yr degree busting their butt for $28/hr for the vet that makes $120/hr? 

How about the post-doc scientist,  who is doing important research after a 4 year undergrad, 2 year masters, 5 year doctoral program...making just 65k/yr?

How about the grade-school teacher after 4 years of undergrad, 2 years of a masters...making 50k/yr?It does if they pursue the technologist path.The point is that vets being underpaid is relative and very subjective, with people frequently using poor ""scientific method"" in arguing their complaint b/c they cherry pick results that support their opinion.Salary or Production, whichever is higher - This is essentially Prosal without the negative accrual, which is pretty standard these days. 

Salary plus production - Depending on the exact structure it sounds like this may just be the same thing, as that's how some might describe Prosal without negative accrual, as it is very rare to get paid a production bonus that doesn't factor in your salary (i.e. you only get production bonuses once your surpassed the production needed to cover your base salary).

All else being equal I'd shoot for higher salary as a new grad. But to be honest I'd worry much more about the other aspects of the job in terms of it being a good fit, a place where you will be well-supported and able to grow as a vet.We've been using it for a long time (used to be under the name eVetPractice before Covetrus took it over). Id say it is thoroughly medium overall. Definitely a step up from Avimark, which we had prior to this, but lacking some features/integrations you would find in PMS systems built from the ground up now. I actually had a good sit down with their lead dev at VMX last year and he explained that they reached a point where the old eVetPractice framework they took over was just too small/limited to handle the direction things are going, so they are basically doing a rebuild of that backend while also trying to gradually upgrade current active features.  

The good: It is stable and user-friendly. Support is readily available and helpful. Price point is great. It is very rare for us to have major issues with the core functions we use it for in terms of scheduling and managing patient records. And using it is really straightforward, so training on it is easy and figuring out how to do new things is easy. 

The bad: Reporting is poor, with relatively limited options and it really struggling with larger reports. Makes it very difficult to parse out production data for giving associate feedback. Inventory system is clunky and time-consuming. Integrations with outside equipment/software are very limited. So if you aren't using their preferred options for phone/lab/cc processor then you might see friction there for your staff (and their preferred options might cost a lot more). It also doesn't integrate with VetCove yet, which we use for the majority of our inventory ordering. It doesn't have good in-patient management/tracking tools, so that could be an issue if you hospitalize a lot of pets. 

Ultimately I don't love it, but I'd recommend it if you are looking for a solid workhorse at a good price. And especially if you are already working in the Covetrus ""family"" of services/products, so your integrations will be smoother.Unless you very strongly prefer RVC, then you should go with LSU 100% unless your family is very well off and supporting you financially. 

120k is A LOT, especially once you consider the interest on it (i.e. double it). It is a huge weight in LSU's favor and easily outweighs the other factors you mentioned.

Graduate and work abroad. Do externships or internships abroad. Graduate and make good money, while paying a lot less in loans and you can travel abroad. Lots of ways to scratch the travel itch, not many ways to save over 120k like this.No one I'm close to fits that, but I do know a former classmate who swapped to real estate sales, and a couple who were/married rich and quit to become stay at home parents.Marine Biology is a pretty big trap in undergrad, terrible job prospects, with very few paid positions actually doing what students envision doing when they think about marine biology. You'll get to do cool stuff in school and internships...then have to get very lucky to find a permanent paying position that isn't just lab/industry work you aren't that into. 

OTOH you could go the aqua vet route on your current path and at least have MUCH better career prospects if the aqua part doesn't quite work out. Like it is still very tough to land a great aquarium or field research gig, but in the meantime you can still be a successful practicing vet and even work aquatics into your daily practice locally.You'll go to vet school and in terms of classes you'll take mostly the same non-wildlife core curriculum that everyone else does. But depending on the school/location there will likely be plenty of other opportunities to work with wildlife along the way via one-off classes, clubs, selectives, volunteering, and externships.Either is fine, I'd go with what you will be most comfortable and confident in. If you feel like you look really sharp in a suit then wear one.Mostly fine, but there are some older more conservative clinic owners/managers who still have policies restricting them. Worst-case you could probably still work at one of those places, you'd just have to wear a long sleeve undershirt.I'm so sorry you are going through that, I know it must be incredibly stressful. 

But...stick it out. IMO the chances of you regretting quitting FAR outweigh the temporary relief you will feel by quitting. So much can change so fast and it could leave you really wishing you'd finished that last year and gotten the degree. 

Your kids will be in school before you know it and suddenly you may find yourself with the time/energy to want to work again. 

Or what happens if your husband dies or you get divorced? How much more secure would you feel knowing you've got a strong fallback career option available? 

Finishing this degree is like buying yourself a very valuable insurance policy.Common for foods, preventatives, rx-refills, and some outside labs to either not be included or be included at a smaller %. Basically all of the stuff where the margins are too slim for the practice to be able to pay the doctor 20+%.In my state, NC, when we host externs we aren't supposed to let them do surgery until 4th year per VMB guidelines.The fact that you are SO confidently incorrect in your assumptions, as described in your edits/comment, is the hallmark trait of the scariest new grads I work with. I sincerely worry for your patients, as less than a year out there is SO much you don't know, you don't even know what you don't know, and with that attitude you'll never learn it. 

Production =/= clinical competence.If you are on pro-sal then your employer shouldn't be in a position to get a windfall if you overperform your expected production. You'll just get really big production bonuses this year and then next year you'll have an established baseline that you can use to set a more appropriate salary in order to smooth out your finances. 

In terms of expectations for a new grad, I do agree with the others that there are too many unknown variables to give a great answer, but a rough one would be\~500k gross.Personally I wouldn't find that argument very convincing for a few reasons:

\- There isn't a standard expected ""new grad hit"", and using an average isn't going to be an accurate reflection of what your employer was expecting. Some practices overpay new grads relative to expectations, some shoot for a break even, some underpay them. Even if you did somehow have the data for the average practice, data which actually doesn't exist, you couldn't assume it applies to yours.

\- If you've had a great year that looks sustainable then you already have a great argument for increasing your salary. There is no need/purpose in bringing up this angle, in fact doing so may HURT you by distracting from the great straight forward angle you have. A lot of managers could have trouble understanding what you are trying to get at, and may even find the argument a bit offensive, thinking it is ridiculous to want extra credit for not sucking when your pay already inherently adjusts for performance.

\- Lets say you suggest something along these lines: ""I've calculated that I've hypothetically saved you about 20k vs the average new grad, so you should give me a 20k bonus to start this year""

\- If they say ""show me the data"", what are you gonna do, show them a reddit thread? Would you trust a reddit thread for 20k?

\- What if they say ""yeah, that's why we hired you, not an average new grad""?

Basically this argument is a major stretch and difficult to argue effectively...so leave it on the sidelines and stick to what you know will work.I think you are just really overestimating the value of this information. The quality of the information is going to be iffy at best, as quantifying this accurately is going to be virtually impossible. Then even if you do manage to quantify it, the value of it is still questionable given the circumstances. Your salary going forward will based on your actual production, not based on your production vs this hypothetical expectation/performance gap.

It is frankly ludicrous to say ""even though you already pay me based on my production, you should give me an extra salary/bonus bump because last year I outperformed a theoretical alternative new grad and prevented you from potentially losing money in that hypothetical situation"". That's your argument in summary and it sounds ridiculous. Plenty of new grads make their salary, it isn't like what you did was some kind of outlandish overachievement. With a new grad hire you take on the risk of them not making salary at first, but it is by no means the hope or default expectation. 

They took on a risk by providing a contractually obligated minimum salary. If you had underperformed some hypothetical expectation would they be coming to you asking you to pay out the difference? Of course not. No, they would look at your performance and adjust your base going forward according to your actual production, how you produced relative to expectations wouldn't matter. 

Do what you want, but I promise you that this line of argument will only serve to hurt you.I see students do all sorts of stuff: Typical gig work like uber/ubereats, pet/house sitting, weekend work at clinics, working through summers. Keeping costs super low is one I don't feel like I see enough of them using, as I see them stressing about money on one hand, then indulging in expensive hobbies/pets/travel/dining/drinks regularly on the other. It's almost like they've been conditioned to think that Starbucks and Ubereats are just normal expenditures as opposed to the luxuries they really are. 

That being said, a disproportionate number do have enough family support to stay afloat that way and not need to work to have the essentials covered.I'm sorry you got stuck in such a tough situation!

Generally speaking if it isn't in your contract then it isn't going to be enforceable. It sounds like you are taking the same tactic I would start with, which is to assume they are making a mistake and ask for more information.Yeah, now it makes sense, although I have no idea what your chances are from a legal pov. I'd never heard the term ""true up"" either, but I know ignorance probably isn't a real legal defense.They won't matter if you are going straight into practice.

If you are looking to specialize, do internship/residency type stuff, basically anything potentially competitive after school, then they might matter.

At my practice we do require them from our intern applicants.So lets start from a reasonable baseline that I hope we can agree on: client communication is an incredibly important aspect of the job and it makes sense for your boss to want to evaluate/train you in this regard. Assuming your boss is actually good at teaching this stuff then this could be some of the most valuable training you ever receive.

So the real question is how you expect them to reasonably accomplish that. Would you prefer them to be in the room with you in-person evaluating/training you while you do exams? Is that better or worse than cameras? Is that a better solution from your boss's POV wrt their time/availability? Maybe they are typically doing other work when you are seeing appointments and are going to be reviewing this stuff at other times.

I completely understand being uncomfortable, but your boss isn't doing anything remotely wrong here. You are uneasy b/c you are being evaluated/trained in an area where you probably do need it (virtually all new grads do). That's just normal human emotion in any similar circumstance. Whether it is in-person or by camera, having your boss/teaching/coach/etc evaluating you is inherently stressful...but also inherently important and necessary.

What should you do? Nothing, appreciate the training you are receiving and go about your business.Why do you say they will be micromanaging OP?

OP is a new grad. OP needs training. Exams and client communication are critical skills for a GP. It is entirely logical for their boss to want to have tools to utilize in training these things.Others have answered this well, so I'll mention a secondary concern they haven't covered: Lifestyle creep

Say you spend 3 years making good money, being in a relatively respected position in an organization, and having a reaasonable work-life balance...plenty of people in that spot might find it difficult to stomach giving that up to make a lot less while working a lot harder.","Medical Doctor.

caomel,"You will love VIN, it has everything you are looking for.

Also search for veterinary groups of Facebook and join those, they may add CE you didn’t realize you needed, or just levity :)Mine have First Name Last Name DVM.

I always introduce myself to clients with a handshake & “Hi, I’m First Name Last Name, good to meet you,” never Dr. Last Name

I want to avoid pretentiousness as much as possible though because I’m in the American South and suspicion/resentment of “doctors/educated type” is at an all time high, and I need maximum buy in from the client to establish a baseline of trust.All the clinic practices I’ve worked at have strongly encouraged me to go by Dr. First Name to avoid pretense, but I feel like an early childhood educator by that method. I abhor it.Regarding seizures specifically, you were in a tough spot here. They are very scary to O’s and they have a lot of (very good) questions. Im of the opinion that none of these ought to be addressed by reception or even a technician - because each answer is likely to trigger a new waterfall of questions, going deeper and deeper into the weeds. 

Because every seizure case needs to be carefully personalized to each patient, I recommend just pawning off the client to the doc. There are lots of subtleties, what ifs, and what to expect with seizures. I send them home with lots of handouts. Sometimes they need to be referred to a neuro specialist. 

I know it’s tempting, because they are scared and they are on the other end of the phone, but for your sanity, get them into a room with the DVM, or at least on the phone with one.Veterinarian here. My Avimark notes are filled with acronyms to keep it short but still convey info. I notice that the tendency of reception is to try to convey tone, but that strategy can get long winded. 

An ex of my notes would look like this:

SWO @ 555-12-1234 P seems itchy like she was last year. O asks if P can refill last med instead of coming in. Informed O that DVM recs exam +/- SS, cytology, or other lab work depending on PE findings. May also consider b/w as P is due for dental soon. O will consider and cb.  Detailed estimate emailed to owner@email.comI hear you with the “tech spoke for 20 mins re seizures and documented almost none of it so who knows what the O expects or not, or what the tech rec’d.” 

It’s not ideal but jeez does it seem to be the norm. 

I’d say skip trying to understand the picture - taking an accurate, non-convoluted, and *actually useful* patient history is a skilled art form that I am still(!) practicing even 12 years out of vet school. The sicker they are, the harder to understand “what is going on & what recent changes occurred” and would say extracting that is a skill just as refined as any surgical procedure I perform. When they are scared, they ramble word salad. They pick up on any cues you give them and run with it. They confuse who said what and when. 

Which answers most of why techs don’t document much: they are burned out by experience. Clients will keep you on the phone way longer than needed, and the difference between what you tell them and what they hear can be an ever widening gulf. Punt it to us DVMs, it’s our gig to try to make the most sense of these cases. 

There’s 100 memories of me having a 45 min conversation with a client nodding along, only to find out at the next recheck that I failed to communicate the importance of something important to the patient healing properly. Another 100 memories of listening to a client talk for 10 minutes, me scribbling down notes, then looking up and realizing I am still not any deeper into understanding the clinical picture. Another 100 for when O tells the technician “I’ve never seen P do XYZ,” then me walk in the room and state “P has been constantly doing XYZ.” It’s frustrating, but we are all imperfect. 

Going back to seizures specifically for a moment. Moving forward it may be best not to assure them that a cause will be found. The most common cause of seizures is called “Idiopathic Epilepsy,” idiopathic being the medical term for “We don’t know what the cause is.” Most seizure patients (except in specific instances) never receive a specific diagnosis. We mostly just spend our time trying to minimize the frequency and severity of the seizures, check for medication adjustments, and monitor how the body is handling being on an anti-seizure medication. 

My major point is : No one without a medical degree is expected to have that knowledge off the tip of their tongue. It’s unfair of the clients to try to get you in that position, to calm them, assuage their fears, promise everything is going to be okay. You are doing a fantastic job, and I’ll agree that I prefer overly detailed notes rather than none. Don’t let clients push you around and try to pin you down for medical information. Let them know you are here to get their pet’s issue(s) addressed, and the medical team will be ready to answer all their concerns.

Best of luck!! Hopefully you find this note reassuring and supportive rather than condescending and preachy.Hi, I’m not sure if you’re interested in large/small animals but any experience with any of them will help:

- Shelter worker. 
- Rescue volunteer (there are a billion)
- Working cattle
- Horse riding 
- 4H anything
- Slaughterhouse/butchers (yeah, even that).

Unless you have a personal, familial relationship with a specific veterinarian, shadowing is not typical. They do not have the liability coverage for you unfortunately.

Try to get hired! Memorize normal species temperature, learn how to take a heart rate, and apply to be a veterinary technician or kennel technician. Convince them you know how to operate a washer/dryer, don’t have to be taught how to sweep & mop, you’re not scared to get dirty, and you stay cheerful with a good attitude when faced with being told to do disgusting chores. 

Good luck!

Honest_Tomatillo013,"Put 👏🏼 them 👏🏼 in 👏🏼 there 👏🏼 place! They are techs and remind them of that! Ugh I’m so sorry. I’m a senior LVT would never act such a way but I have ran into types of these “techs” which none have any education or the experience they have is minimal and they want to be some kind of way. Not just no but HELL NO. Shut it down! There may be someone in charge but personally I would address these little monsters myself. I would be firm and stern addressing your position as doctor. Tell them we ARE NOT FRIENDS and you WILL NOT refer to me by my first name. I’m so sorry, just be confident! You made it through school, you can survive this!Yeah because corporate companies have taking over vetmed in a lot of areas so politics of order have changed. This advice goes both ways though because a doctor should not treat a tech like trash just because they went to med school. Reality is though is doctors and techs are not on the same playing field. Yeah they are a team and need to work together as one. Reality is though veterinarians are in the major leads while techs are in the minor league because the two are not the same, education and experience separates the two. There is no reason to treat a new grad like trash just because a tech, which we don’t even know if they are registered or not, has some experience under their belt. This is a professional field and news flash, doctors DO tell techs what to do because that’s their job 🤣 colleagues are not there’s no reason to be disrespectful. Everybody on this sub sees how miserable veterinarians are becoming and it’s because of bad people. So many people who actually love the profession hate their job because there’s so much disrespect going on. It’s super sad and disturbing to see young vets go through all the hell they go through to get through school and end up wanting to leave just because people treat them so horribly and it’s completely unnecessary especially people who don’t have a medical degree.So are you now saying that this new grad doesn’t treat their tech a certain way so now they deserve to be disrespected? Yes, I agree treat people how you want to be treated, but do you think if you weren’t a doctor that your clinic would just magically operate? No, people, tech and  doctors, both need to be led and directed. So correct me, it’s not about telling people what to do. It’s about guiding people in the right direction and forming healthy relationships and bonds. I think if you don’t wanna be called doctor that’s your personal choice but if an individual prefers to be called doctor, then that’s what should be respected.Haha I do not belittle my techs because they are great and respectful 🤣 This sub is not just about title usage, it’s about the disposition and disrespect a new grad is receiving by individuals who have not experienced what they have experienced. I am suppose to believe that someone who has walked two years in their shoes has the same experience as someone who has been walking a similar path for 8 with education? Things just are not the same. In your defense, techs should take a stand and not work in a toxic environment. If your doctor treats you like crap then you NEED to leave. If you stay you are only enable THEIR negative behavior. Oh and let me say, in my state, you are not a TECH unless you graduated from an AVMA accredited program and I bet you there are a lot of vet assistants who have an attitude like yourself. People who did not pursue an education and have no idea what it’s like to actually finish something they started. What’s happening is people are trying to lower the standards because they didn’t go to school instead of just respecting each other and respecting boundaries. You’re basically saying that an individual who went to school for 8+ years doesn’t deserve the right to be called Dr.? Yeah, it’s a title and they damn well earned it.Alabama here, we are so busy we can hardly keep up and it’s that way for several practices in this area. The practice im working with is well established but there are so many people that want to be seen because their own vets are not able to see them in a timely manner. What do you think is going on with your facility that clients aren’t coming in? Is there competition in the area taking business? Or do clients bicker about prices?So this totally sounds like a corporate veterinary Clinic because I don’t know anywhere else where a technician would have the audacity to speak to another vet like that in a private practice. I’ve been working in veterinary medicine for over 20 years and just recently graduated with my degree to take the VTNE next month and with even all my great experience, I do not know more than a doctor Nor do I have the skills of a doctor! Guess what, neither do the people making those hateful snide comments to you! Did they go to school for anything? Do they specialize in surgery? Do they have the initials DVM behind their name?? There has been a generational switch where these young ones don’t respect veterinarians and I’m only 35 but I’ve ran into 20 something -year-olds who think they can tell me what to do and boy are they so wrong. I totally respect the fact that there has to be trust built up but it’s not your responsibility to build the trust up with the technicians. If they don’t want you working on their dog, that’s their problem. It’s funny because it’s almost like they think that they’re important enough that you would want to work on their dog, almost expressing their narcissistic tendency. Remember it’s your license, your insurance, your rules, and if your that assistant or license technicians have a problem with that, don’t hesitate to put them in their place. No matter how much experience a technician has in surgery they have still never operated before so they can’t judge you for something that they have never done! A good tech knows how to guide a new graduate in the direction that’s going to be beneficial to everyone without being so belittling or degrading.So, if you make $125k a year (low end) are you gonna let $200-300k of student debt stop you from making 125k a year? If you can find another way to make more money with less debt I would highly recommend it because there are job opportunities available. Are you gonna be able to do those jobs in your 60s? 70s? Are you going to be happy? I’m 35 and I’ve changed career paths, being a Vet tech to going to school to become a doctor (maybe human, may be vet idk yet).

Someone said they are 17 years out and still take their days off to shadow their mentor. I find that laughable. If that’s your jam, great, but it shouldn’t be an expectation because for most people it’s an unhealthy boundary. 

If you are hiring a new grad it should be done with the expectation that you are training them AT WORK.  Why is this not obvious. And don’t tell me “it’s not in their contract. “ that’s on ownership taking advantage of new grads. Basically saying, I’ll train you but not when I’m paying you. Fuck you. You knew who you’re hiring. 

Totally unhealthy to expect all the pressures of being a new grad and not allowing them to completely disconnect on their days off. I keep thinking of new grads with young children, are they worse doctors/employees because they use their time off to be with their kids?It’s not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning on their days off. If the only surgical mentorship/training offered is unpaid extra days of work that is not appropriate. A new grad job should be organized in such a way that this training can be done in normal business hours- it’s not hard to do.  

Owners who are constantly obsessed with their supposed reputation being ruined because someone missed a blood draw are quite common. They are also mostly delusional. I’ve watched 40 year vets miss blood draws. It happens. It’s not a business death sentence, it’s just a thing that happens. Turns out the only solution is repetition, which means more misses. It’s short sighted for this to be the owners main feedback.Shouldn’t OP expect a job where these types of things are taught when they are at work? At least 90% of the time.But if you are the practice owner who hired a new grad you should have anticipated this and planned for it. If you are an associate expected to train a new grad you should be negotiating compensation. This is not on OP to figure out.OP expects their employer to train them on company time. This is a reasonable expectation for a new grad. One that the employer should understand as a 35+ year veterinarian. You are making this more complicated and personal than it has to be. 

Simply, employers train new grads on company time. That’s part of the deal.Eye rollSeems like you do many things right, and nothing wrong. Any reason the techs could have a lack of trust in your opinion? Or is it just that multiple nurses, on different occasions, feel they should go out of their way to avoid your opinion.

alittlemouth,"Rowan hasn't released their tuition rates yet, but I'd imaging at least $50k/year, even if in-state.  Yes, surgeons can make $300k+, but keep in mind that in order to be a surgeon you have to complete vet school, a rotating internship, 1+ surgical specialty internships, and a 3-year residency, which are historically not very well paid (though some of that is changing, depending on where you go).  Definitely do-able.  Whether it's ""worth it"" 100% depends on you.UA’s total cost of attendance is estimated to be $83k/year for residents and $110k/year for non-residents. That is as much as Penn and Cornell, to go to a school without an associated hospital. Insane.I guess I have huge concerns about a school that partners with “over 250” sites for clinical year and how they ensure every one of those sites is providing excellent clinical education that meets their standards. I guess there’s no better way to gauge success other than NAVLE pass rates (UA's was only 72%, failing to meet the goal for accreditation), which will be interesting to monitor once these new schools start churning out new grads.

Edited to add:
Just looking at tuition only, UA's resident tuition is $47k/year (total over 3 years = $141k), non-resident is $73k (total over 3 years = $219k).  UC Davis, which is currently the #1 ranked school in the US, is $35k for the first 3 years, and $39k for the 4th, for a total of $143k for residents.  For non-residents total is $192k.I’d focus your externships on procedural things: dentistry and surgery. Mentorship in these areas is really hit or miss once you graduate.I dunno, man. I just find some of this so hard to believe. Being told you’re a waste of space? Perhaps you think people view you that way, but there’s no way someone actually said that to you. 

It sounds like maybe you didn’t choose the right vet school if there’s such a lack of curriculum in which you’re interested. When I was in school there were entire blocks and courses dedicated to production and farm medicine, exotics, chickens, and yes, amphibians/reptiles/fish. I will say that there wasn’t a whole lot re: aquaculture, but I think that’s because of how little need there is in that field. 

It makes sense to hire another small animal researcher: companion animals are where the majority of research is being done, and that is the sphere in which the majority of veterinarians work. 

If you want to go into a niche field, you need to understand that you will be responsible for seeking out niche experiences.>it’s standard procedure to handle all paperwork and financial matters PRIOR to euthanasia. I’ve never had one single client raise an eyebrow about jt. Our CSRs always get that part out of the way first, so the owner can focus on their pet and not have to worry about anything else. No one wants to stop in the lobby to pay their bill after they’ve cried their eyes out and lost their pet. If you’re losing clients regarding this issue specifically, maybe it’s the approach that’s needs fine-tuning, not necessarily the protocol.

Agreed. We’ve even designed our hospital so our euthanasia/comfort room has a separate exit so clients can go directly to the parking lot afterwards without having to go through the lobby.Definitely not, but keep in mind that you are also the patient’s advocate and will sometimes notice things the vet didn’t, and it’s okay to speak up! Sometimes my best diagnostic tool is the tech who felt a lump while carrying in a critter, or who noticed a positional nystagmus while taking rads that I couldn’t elicit on exam. A good tech who is always watching and monitoring is priceless!Whichever cardiologist is well known and willing to write her a fantastic letter. That’s it. Nothing else matters.This sounds pretty nitpicky, TBH.  Your first step is to sit down with the MD and define your roles.  A good MD will often have a lot of overlap with a practice manager/hospital director because they want to be involved in management of the hospital as a whole rather than simply giving medical direction.What will you do if you don't do this?  I'm always pointing out sunk cost fallacy, but in this case it seems insane to me to not just finish and at least have the degree to show for it.  Even if you don't practice clinical medicine you can go into industry, research, shelter med, at-home euthanasia, etc.  

It's also important to determine if you are miserable because of vet school, or if you are just miserable.  If it's the latter, quitting ain't gonna help.Metronidazole use was a hot topic at both VECCS and ACVIM this year.  One speaker presented a host of studies that essentially said *nothing* you do improves the course of acute diarrhea (metro, probiotics, bland diet, etc). Another lecture recommended using metro when hematochezia is present due to its anti-inflammatory properties. I think there is still a lot of controversy, and I think the anti-inflammatory effects are honestly difficult to measure. 

Sure, the number of days to resolution might be the same, but is the patient more comfortable? Is the intestinal glycocalyx better preserved if there is less inflammation?  We don’t know those things. 

I use metro for appropriate infections, concern for intestinal bacterial translocation, and when there is hematochezia. Whether that’s right or not, I don’t know, but I don’t think anyone really does at this point. 

Prazosin, on the other hand, is something I don’t touch anymore. Even before there was new data, I was always shocked at how many people prescribed it without checking a blood pressure first, especially in sick UO kitties. Make it make sense.As an aside, what's your umbrage with gabapentin?  I use it regularly as an adjunct as I like the sedation it provides for a lot of things (ie; chills out FLUTD cats, keeps cruciate dogs more easily rested, etc.).Where are you that you're able to do a CRP bedside or do you send it out, wait for results, then have clients come back to pick up metro if elevated?Prazosin can cause hypotension.  In an already hypotensive sick UO potentially causing additional hypotension is worrisome from an organ perfusion perspective.Oh yeah, that's nuts.  I'll always give 3-5 days of an NSAID even if they decline blood work...I just educate and document, but I don't think it's fair to a dog to not get an anti-inflammatory when it's indicated, especially after surgery!  My hospital (Spec and ER only) rarely uses it as a single agent, other than for mild things that also would benefit from some sedation.Why on earth would anyone see it as a win that they get to keep working for Banfield.1050/day isn't worth seeing 20+ pets including sick dropoffs, walk-ins, etc.  Being that busy means you can't practice good medicine.  No amount of money is worth risking your license.If you’re feeling burnt out an internship is not the right move here.As a data point, I recently hired two doctors; one went through the VEG program, the other through an NVA program. The VEG doctor worked 4 overnights per week for the entire last 3 months of her program, and the NVA doc worked five 12 hour shifts, weds-sun, for the entire 6 month program and they were both burnt to a CRISP afterwards, so make sure you fully understand what your schedule and required hours will be prior to signing on the dotted line.Thankfully they now work for me, and do 3x12, fixed schedule. 😊I don't think your surgical technique was the problem - the problem was that this was an adult dog with a big ol' scrotum, and even with the best technique, some of these will develop a hematoma, sometimes a HUGE one.  Scrotal ablations help to significantly decrease this risk.The NAVLE pass rate is 90%. Your friend sounds as though they lean towards the dramatic and hyperbole.","Multiple Professionals.

MargoPlikts,"I’ve worked in many zoos and it’s SOP to have MDs come in and assist. This is decreasing somewhat with the increasing prevalence of vet specialists around but is still very common and very appropriate. The amount of experience that a human OBGYN/surgeon has doing that type of surgery vs a vet is immense.Well it’s important to understand that in these scenarios the MD is being invited in specifically to be the authority in the room. Zoo vets are generalists, and are generally very good team players who have the patients best interest as the primary focus. Egos take a back seat (which is a bit funny, because a lot of zoo vets are kinda egotistical, though deservedly). Often, one team of zoo vets will be focused on the anesthesia and restraint, anesthetic monitoring, etc while the other team, including visiting help/specialists, perform whatever needs to be done. It’s a team effort.

Master-Arm-4753,"Hi  I recently just got into Western University of Health Science-Veterinary School in California. This was my second cycle applying and I took a gap year in between. 

During my gap year, I took some post bacc classes and gained more veterinary experience in order to stay competitive. 

My GPA ended  up being around  a 3.4.

I was interviewed previously from Western in my first cycle applying, however, was not offered admissions after the interview process.



This second cycle, I was referred to Alex Leventhal to help me do mock interviews. Alex was so great to work with and was very detailed on what graduate schools are looking for in their applicants. He is a Harvard grad and specializes in various grad school applications.

Because of our mock interviews, I was more confident in my actual interview and felt that I gave better answers compared to my first cycle interview with Western.



I also appreciated that Alex was able to help me with the essay portion of the Vet School applications. I liked his style of getting to know me and being able to use that information to help format my personal statement and supplemental essays. I would highly recommend working with Alex if you need help with your essays and interviews.

Emp1ly,"I’m a little more than year out of school. The best way I have found to prevent a ligature from slipping is adding an additional ligature if you feel like you need it as well as transecting the pedicle distal to the hemostat. Then obtain a good hold of pedicle tissue proximal to the hemostat with your forceps. Then release the hemostat. At this point you still have a hold of the pedicle with forceps. You can then inspect and blot with a gauze to check for bleeding. Once you are happy make a controlled release into the body. Always remember a larger incision is a safer incision.  If you don’t feel comfortable with your work space it’s ok to make the incision site larger. Closing time will speed up with steady practice and correct closure technique. Be patient with yourself.

Pet insurance companies often look for certified techs to review and triage records, which could be a building block to a great career in insurance/sales/management one day! I know it's not the hands on type of experience but it's an available pathway if you really are prioritizing livability and salary.It's truly an embarrassment to offer that for what techs do, but the veterinary field in general is highly underpaid, hence why so many people eventually transition to human medicine. I'd argue the clinic I'm at is one of the highest paying clinics in Denver, we do have some techs that make about $28 but they're our department lead.It's definitely more livable than a lot of wages, but as far as larger life goals it'll be very tight when it comes down to itHi! Vet CSR of about 7 years here. I've been at my current practice for about 3 1/2 years now and here are some of the things that have kept me here, ergo I would inquire about these things with future employers.
- Benefits (I get PTO, health insurance, 401k matching, free mental health care, dental care, and sick pay)
- Work Culture (my clinic team gets along great, we often do seasonal events outside of work like staff parties/bars, camping, one year we went white water rafting. Just overall how well everybody enjoys each others company and bonds. I understand a lot of people don't care for this but I enjoy having coworkers AND friends.)
- Evaluate the pay and compare it to other clinics in the area. I make $23/hour in a HCOL area and it's honestly one of the things that keeps me here. We get annual raises.
- Frequent paid for lunch and learns from reps and other companies (CPR training, product education, emergency response, things like that)
- Employee discounts!!! One of the biggest perks of working at a vet. What's your discount rate on take home products? Access to Hill's/Royal Canine/PPP VIP markets for half priced food if you need it? Do you pay an exam fee or for services like nail trims?

Do you mean transferring into a DVM/MPH program??I am not exactly sure why he said to go get an MPH, because I don't know what I would do with one either! I didn't bring up the idea. I would just go back to my pre-vet school R&D lab job. 

I thought about lab animal med! I'm personally not super comfortable working with lab animals though, even though I worked with them before vet school and even work with them now part-time. It would depend a lot on the study and I don't think you're allowed to be *that* picky? My irrational ex-vegan guilt catches up with me sometimes.Thank you for the support. The residents here are awesome! They just don't seem very happy? The two I work with are both in the old combined PhD residency and our school recently switched to a combined Master's instead. One of them mentioned the other day that they would have definitely preferred the shorter route. Can you provide any insight into that decision in your experience? Aside from not feeling like I belong here, I am also worried about committing another 6 years to schooling when I'm already 31.Thank you! May I ask what you ended up doing with your degrees? And how you found mentors?The biggest upside would be not taking up another 2 years of debt. If I left at this point, I could eventually pay it off with my back-up career. 😅Thank you so much for sharing!! It feels better to know I'm not actually alone in the vet med world, and that someone has already made it out the other end. I am having a difficult time finding mentors (and externships that are not specifically for third/fourth year students) and would appreciate any insight? I applied to a couple externships for the summer but haven't heard back yet. I do work at the wildlife lab (research and necropsies!) - I love the work, I love my coworkers, and I am so in awe of my boss and her career but she is retiring and working remotely at this point. The wildlife pathologist who led me to vet school is having some health troubles and understandably doesn't have the time or energy for me. I feel like a lot of my anxieties are due to bad luck or bad timing.Thank you for your insight! I love the pathologists at my school! I did apply for a diagnostic pathology fellowship for this summer but haven't heard back yet. I had some discouraging words from one of the pathologists the other day though, that I should have been showing that I was more interested in pathology somehow, or should already have a pathology case study published, should be visiting path programs at other schools, should have been working as a timeslip at the diagnostic lab, etc. It made me feel like I was already behind and it would be a very steep uphill climb to get into a residency at this point.Thank you for sharing! You should know there are surprisingly a lot of equine students in my class! But it definitely helps me feel better to know it's not just me. 🙂Tufts was one of my dream schools! I applied to their DVM/MPH program, but didn't get in. I will reach out to them for sure! Thank you.I worked at an exotics-only vet for a couple years before vet school, and I work in the wildlife research lab now. I definitely want more experience with wildlife, but I think clinical exotics would be too much for me. I am not sure I'd like to be dealing with exotics clients every day for the rest of my life. 😅Thank you. I did apply for some dual programs but wasn't accepted. I paraphrased the criticism (but those exact words were used). But I think his biggest points were that I don't have an exact plan of where I see myself in 10 years, I'm not searching out enough opportunities (""why don't you have a fellowship with the CDC already?""), and that I will hate vet med because I don't want to be a SA clinician (that was my bad for mentioning I would consider doing SA GP/ER/relief work for a couple years to pay off my loans).Thank you! Yes, his point was that I don't have any clear goals with a 10-year plan. I have been having a difficult time finding mentors because of my interests, though I think it's mostly bad luck. One of my favorite pathologists is out for health reasons, the only wildlife vet on campus is retiring, and a couple of the other pathologists I've spoken with are not very supportive. I'm not sure how else to find mentorship?","Veterinarian.

Marko941,"If that is the case then why did you have to give 2 months notice? If you've been there less than a year then the laws for reasonable notice would lead to the conclusion that 2 weeks is enough. You're not management and given your experience level you're relatively easy to replace (relative for the industry). 

If you signed an employment contract without seeing a lawyer first then a quick consultation and they might tell you you can change to 2 weeks or even walk off. I'm a just a plumber and I learned the hard way that you should always get a lawyer to review your employment contract. It's like insurance; the 300-700 you'll spend will keep you from getting screwed.So if you didn't see a lawyer for the contract a consultation may still be useful. If there is a ton of extravagant or unenforceable content and it's your first job and you didn't seek counsel, no judge would enforce it. Also if there are any non-legal clauses like a hold-harmless clause or a non-compete clause then the contract is illegal. For a contract to be a contract the content has to be legal. Was told by my lawyer that a lot of times these crazy types put BS in the contract and any time that happens it results in a judge throwing the case out the first day. Gowling is who I use and they're worth the premium!Non competes are illegal in employment contracts in Canada (at least in ontario) so what they usually do instead is over-reach on a clause which is legally only supposed to protect from customer poaching.  It will say something like you can't serve any customers past or present for a period of 2 years. It's not enforceable because how the hell are you supposed to keep track of who their past & present customers are!? Talk to the lawyer first though.","Other.

PAFC2004,"Almost all techs know more about the practicalities of veterinary medicine and practice than us when we first graduate.   


We don't earn respect by graduating, we earn it by being part of a team and learning on the job.   


As a side note, all of my nurses/techs call me by my first name, and I ask my clients to do so also.After a few years in practice, it's easy to do both at the same time for common cases (vaccines, diarrhoea, skin etc.).

I do think it's important to introduce yourself to the client and pet first, and then take notes. It shows the client you are actively listening and that you care about their pet. It also helps you build a rapport with the client. It makes the difference between a 'clinical' visit and a visit that shows you have their pet's best interests at heart.

I'd say it's even more important in your first few years as it does take time to develop problem solving skills in the consult room and separating the two gives you time to evaluate the situation and formulate a plan.

If you are time limited (such as short consults), ask management to give you another 5 minutes per consult. It will help you and them in the long run.Fair point, but I think it's important to perform a thorough physical examination on every animal, regardless of presentation, signalment or history.

Voidelfvettech,"This is a healthy doctor-tech relationship! Not what those bullies were doing to OP!! 
I am a tech and I recently got assigned to work with a baby vet. I'll admit, it REALLY stressed me out. I didn't know how to help him, and I felt that every word I said was something he really listened to which actually really stressed me out because I still feel like a baby tech so felt that I shouldn't be someone he listened to. As dumb as that all sounds, it made me really stressed to work with him. My unicorn practice noticed I was stressed before I did (I'm terrible at deciphering my own feelings) and talked to me about it in a private environment. They switched me off being his tech and gave him a tech that is extremely experienced and was able to help him in all the ways I couldn't. 

That all being said, I never made any rude comments to the baby vet like those girls did to OP. No matter how stressed I got. That is classic mean girl behavior and should never be tolerated.We've started losing crazy things at my hospital recently. A fetal two headed pig recently went missing.

You can choose to be more surgery focusedIt may be a good time to get an idea of the types of mentorship you’ll receive for your grad work, funding, support for networking and conferences, and how you choose a lab/project. Eg do you rotate for 6 months and then decide? Also, how is your committee chosen (see them as assets!). 

The other thing to keep in mind is that you can do a PhD with a LAM residency (MIT, JHU, and others offer this). This route may also impact your salary (overall/through your grad work), bursaries/grants, and loan forgiveness, but I don’t know all of the details of that.

PettyWitch,"I’m not a vet but it looks like you’re getting different answers here. 

From my perspective what matters the most is the welfare of the animal in its individual situation, not what is popular ethically.

If you know the toes are likely to become infected and his particular owners probably won’t make the effort to prevent that, the best thing for the cat is to remove the problematic toes.

Trust your own sense of what feels right for the animal, that’s all you can do. People will eat you alive on the internet no matter what you do.

Also I have no idea why moving a toe with no real attachment is an issue. It’s just basically a skin tag.Owner here not a vet. I completely agree. I try my best to make people understand when this comes up in the wild. People are ridiculous.I’m not a vet just an owner, but trying to understand. Do you mean Metronidazole given to a patient with diarrhea when Giardia is present or suspected? Or is Metronidazole given for the symptom of diarrhea itself?A few years ago was the first time I had ever been asked by a vet (my first time at that clinic) if I wanted to medicate my dog for the visit. I was so shocked, and now I know it’s become a whole thing. I’ve had dogs for decades, many dogs as a breeder, and I always made sure they were trained for the vet. You don’t bring a farrier out to do your horse’s hooves without training them to stand…. I bring my own bait and we practice the table exam and raising confidence while waiting for the vet to come in. At home I practice touching them everywhere and restraining them so they are used to it and enjoy it. All of mine end up enjoying the vet visits and getting excited when they know it’s time. 

I just can’t fathom needing medication. Has pet ownership gotten worse? My main concern with medicating a dog before exam is what if it masks symptoms they are having, such as pain?","Other.

The same account has videos of a cat spay and a dog neuter. 

It's pretty amazing to have a video of one of the very best veterinary surgeons performing and explaining this surgery!Do not work for Lap of Love and do not do IHE right out of school.

I have been doing IHE exclusively for 5 years and i can't imagine doing so right out of school.

Work in GP or ER or urgent care for at least a year.I am. :) 

You know, I'm so glad I found my people.

This is the happiest I've ever been as a veterinarian. 

I found my calling.They WERE good, until they got venture capitalist funding and turned corporate.

IHE is very easy to do on your own, without a 'parent company' dictating your days, hours, and practices, and taking a cut from your profit for the privilege. 

[This book](https://www.amazon.com/Animal-Hospice-Palliative-Medicine-House/dp/0323567983) is a great place to start, and there are FB groups of like-minded veterinarians to support you. 

There is nothing comparable to working for yourself. Especially as a veterinarian, as you can decide who you're going to help, and how, and when.Hi Coleen, thank you for everything you do. <3 This is important, meaningful work.Working for myself to provide IHE is the only way I can bear to continue as a vet.

I hated feeling like both the most and least important person in the practice. I used to dread going into work, I would get sick every morning.

Not anymore!FWIW, Vetco pays me more than that for a 10-5 vaccine clinic w an hour lunch.I do live in a HCOL area. 

One of my in-home euthanasia appointments is around $500, without aftercare!

Melancholic-Moose,"And increasing the spots in existing programs. They claim it's to train rural mixed and large animal practice vets, but then have a. no way of making sure people actually go into those communities, b. don't adequately prepare people for that type of practice (so much small animal, minimal everything else), and c. where are these practices even? Not like you can start your own with the considerable loan burden after graduation. Just a tuition money grab I'm convinced.I don't have a dual degree but I did do a PhD prior starting vet school. The one thing I would ask about is if there is a set time limit for the PhD portion and what happens if you aren't done in that time frame. It's very very common for grad degrees to go over the typical 4 years etc.Hello fellow geriatric, I agree. I'm 35 and somehow older than some of the instructors and I also have more education than some of them (I was a research scientist in agriculture first and have a PhD, while also working part time still in the horse industry). Sometimes I do watch people and think ""yeah maybe there is a reason for this"", but sometimes...many times...I feel like they are just making the new crop of vets more condescending and more apt to fall on their faces when they actually have to talk to a real person.Oh yeah, like I said. Not saying it's not important. I'm angry because we sound like condensing idiots talking to our ""clients"". I would never ever comfort someone by saying ""I can see that this is frustrating and hard for you to understand"". So it makes me rageful when I'm stopped and asked to reword into something that makes me sound like a grade A asshole. 

For what it's worth, people are mostly crying because someone cuts you off every 3 seconds and tells you to start again and I think they just get frustrated. The ones that cry during euthanasia conversations etc. are different. 

But point taken.Not CSU, I'm in Canada. But I have heard that our communications programs are very similar.Oh absolutely! I would also say things similar to what you mentioned. We are forced to add a I can see (hear or feel) on the start of all statements like that and end in ""for you"" so everything just comes out condescending. I'm actually afraid I will do it to a real human someday and it won't go over well.Ha! Yes...use it in our every day conversations. No thank you, I would still like to have friends. I maintain that if a vet showed up and said most of this stuff to me I would leave.

neorickettsia,"Does  this still apply to “this is completely out of our scope” patients? I’m an LVT at a GP and one day I only had a green doctor available. 

In walks in a client’s pet sitter  with a cat that claims it got outside for 30 minutes and is now bleeding and they think it got in a cat fight. Assistant picks up the cat for DVM to visualize wounds and there’s full thickness lacerations with intestinal loops visible. We have like 3 ER facilities within 10 minutes, cat is QAR and stable. I very quickly  bandage the cat for the ride over and put a cone on as my doctor is talking to the “owner” about how they need to immediately bring it to another facility if the intention is to save the cat. 

Could I have placed an IV catheter, gave an injection of pain medication, a bolus of fluids, and other things to more clinically stabilize the patient? Yes. But if any of those things caused the cat to decompensated I didn’t have the appropriate medications, available surgical suit, experienced support staff, or emergency experienced DVM to facilitate stabilization. We felt collectively the cat was best going immediately elsewhere and was in our building for less that 5 minutes total.  More than happy to call and send records too but by the time we could get off hold the cat was already at the other facility. 

I do agree it’s stupid for the GP’s that do surgery but then send it to ER with no records for monitoring because they’re closing and the pet is laterally recumbent still. Like no records, not even a call??? Dude we don’t even know what drugs your animal had already received and what was done to it.I think #2 is the biggest question I have, the only reason I can “justify” the techs acting this way is if OP themselves gets snappy/rude when overwhelmed- even if they’re technically “on time”.","Veterinarian.

I've been using Kryptex for a while now, and I've got a good grasp of mining.   
However, I have some questions about Mysterium.  
  
How can I assess or calculate my monthly profit with Mysterium?   
I've gone through the articles provided by Kryptex, but the profitability of Mysterium remains unclear to me. How is profitability calculated? And how can I boost my earnings without switching to Mysterium Dark?  
  
It appears that Mysterium Dark (Public) is not recommended, as it might not be safe for me as a Node keeper. I've gone through the terms, but they are not entirely clear. Perhaps, this is a question for the Mysterium Team.

It seems Mysterium is pretty safe if using first two B2B switches.Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, I've gone through the articles, and I truly appreciate Kryptex's instructions—they're quite straightforward. However, my inquiry primarily revolves around Mysterium. It would be great to have some approximate data in my WebUI. Since they're aware of my country, it would be helpful if they could display an estimated profitability in the UI for me as a Node Keeper. Alternatively, maybe there could be a public API so that Kryptex can utilize that information to predict profitability based on LAST\_MONTH\_EARNINGS. Mining profitability fluctuates, and it's acceptable to witness $100 today and $80 tomorrow. The same approach could be implemented for Mysterium.Indeed, as I mentioned earlier, I've gone through the articles, and I truly appreciate Kryptex's instructions—they're quite straightforward.

SubstantialBother955,"just reading this letter and all the comments corroborating the contents makes me not want to pursue vet med. i can’t imagine being treated like that, especially since my husband is a saint, my current job (as a groomer out of a vet practice + boarding facility) allows me a set schedule, decent pay, and time for my family if need be. i’ve been a groomer for 5 years now, and i’ve always wanted to be a veterinarian, and i’ve seemed to be able to justify all the other trials and tribulations of pursuing this career… but this? this is outrageous. i don’t know if it’s because i work with two good DVM’s and amazing RVT’s and have a great practice manager that i never even considered this to be a possibility, but holy hell. i understand why the suicide rate for veterinarians is so high…this is devastating to say the least, and horrifying to say the most. i knew it was hard, but never could’ve comprehended it would be THAT hard. i feel like quitting before i even start, simply because this makes me feel like i wouldn’t be cut out for it; and maybe that’s what they’re wanting. they don’t want fresh eyes, because they want to keep hiding alllll the wrong they’re doing. this generation is the one that will pull the wool off everyone’s eyes, and i really hope that’s the case. as someone with an outside perspective, and to everyone who’s experienced this level of abuse, I AM SO SORRY. you got into this career because you wanted to help animals thrive, because you wanted to be their voice, because you wanted to help heal the sick, and you don’t deserve this. i hope one day that the governing bodies of veterinary medicine stick up for you guys, because i don’t even want to imagine what could happen if they don’t. love you all🫶🏽","Veterinarian.

>BUT HOW IN THE HECK DO WE GET ANOTHER DOCTOR IF THEY ALL GO FOR PROFIT

So, is it a non-profit?!  Because, if it is, I am not sure you can have an 'owner'.

The big red flag for me (keep in mind, I am a jaded mofo who has been screwed over by owners/corp. in the past) is you don't pay competitive wages (you basically said it yourself), build up a great practice under the guise of non-profit, then the owner sells out for millions.  

So, it sounds like this is a 'for profit' company; they just invest some money back into the community/staff.

Any business able to do everything you are mentioning, and build a new/bigger building, should be able to pay enough to entice talented doctors.I think we sometimes forget the toll 'mental' work has on our body.  Studying and working (in a more cerebral capacity) can seriously strain your energy stores.  Just because you are not digging ditches or hauling wheel barrels doesn't mean you're not working.

For me, after a long stressful day, I like to find 'mindless' chores to help me reset (mowing the lawn, landscaping, going for a long walk).  Even though I am tired, keeping it physical (with NO mental component) helps me recharge/reset.

Reading a book or even listening to a podcast is the last thing I want/should do in those situations.>You will make mistakes.  There was only one perfect man to ever walk the earth, and things didn't end so well for Him either.

LoL, I've never heard that before, I love it!My new favorite, are 'Urgent Care' hospitals sending over patients with printed-out bloodwork, urinalysis, thyroid tests, and radiographs... no notes, no interpretation, nothing... just the printed-out labs/diagnostics for me to interpret.>Did the owner get confused since the words are very similar? 

It's possible, but I was cognizant of my language (why I wrote 'declaw' in quotes).Thanks, I am not sure why this one got to me, but after the responses to the review, I started questioning myself

&#x200B;

>I’d respond to any reviews they’ve made with the facts of what actually happened

Yeah, my office manager is doing a great job with damage control and copy and pasted my notes (pertinent parts regarding my recommendations) in the response.  At no point did I use the term 'declaw' and was clear that it was secondary to the option of keeping them cut.  

I appreciate your feedback!>Perhaps frame it as a toe amputation vs a declaw will help?

Yeah, my choice in title for this post was not ideal.  I put 'declaw' in quotes because it wasn't my terminology (but what the client elected to write in their review).  I probably said 'remove' or amputate. 

Thanks for your feedback!Thanks!  It's funny, I don't normally (ever?) recommend amputating dewclaws on polydactyl cats, just this time, as they came in infected.  

Good on you for keeping your cat's nails trimmed.  Its a PIA, and I commend you (doubt I could keep it up).LoL, thanks.  I needed a bit of reassurance (for some reason).  At the time of my recommendation, it seemed like such an obvious solution... then the crazies rolled in ;-)Thanks, I think I was having a senior moment, wondering if I was the one who was crazy with my recommendation.  

Social media and people are weird!Thanks, it's good to know that my advice wasn't really that into left field.  BTW, I am pretty sure I said 'remove' to the client (which is why I wrote 'declaw' with quotes) - but I've learned to be even MORE careful.>How did your diagnosis get posted to social media?

Facebook review.  Thankfully my office manager is doing great work setting the record straight!ROFL, I leave positive reviews for random vet clinics around the county (usually ER because they get the brunt of the haters) where I call out inappropriate negative reviews and why the post is inappropriate.

My favorite is when people write a negative review of a GP when they will not see an emergency on a weekend when they're regular ved is closed (yeah, very specific, but I see it a lot).>IMHO the digits are not causing the problem. The owner not trimming the nails is causing the problem.

Yeah, I dont know.  I think there is more to this.  The offending nails are not like a typical 'dewclaw', they are thicker (like a hyperthyroid cat) and seem to grow faster.  The 'original' dewclaw (D1) is pretty normal looking.

I don't know the pathophysiology of it (it's not just because they are 'dewclaws', as I would expect the actual dewclaw to look the same in this case).  

With that said, it may be possible to clip them for the first couple of months, but after the neuter, it really would be an extra surgery.>another vet chiming in from purely based on a cat owner’s perspective with no context is very dumb lol (assuming no context)

As it turns out, this 'vet' is not a vet, but a tech or assistant who misrepresented themselves.  I am staying out of it (letting my office manager handle it).  I am... well, too volatile right now to engage with these people, and my OM is doing a pretty good job!>Doggie has a small sebaceous adenoma?  Offer to remove it under local anesthesia right now before they leave. 

Yes, this!

I would add cat neuters,  most mass removals, perhaps cat spays (if time), to the list of things that can be done on a slow afternoon.  I have a long lunch that i really don't use (I watch videos), I try to fill them up with procedures (instead of booking them out).  

Keep in mind, that February is traditionally our slowest month (that is why its 'dental month' - to try and drum up appointments).

But yes, its been VERY slow lately.

Incendently, ER has been CRAZY busy.  I suspect its due to people trying to save money, and forgoing GP care until its too late.>We charge $75+ for a feline leukemia vaccine that costs about $12. Is this normal?

Holy shit!

I've worked at a few expensive hospitals, but nothing like that!

No, that's not 'normal'.

I would say, 2 - 3x markup is normal/high for GP, but I also acknowledge that some places have much higher costs (taxes, wages, property, ect.)I worked last Saturday, 20 ER cases on my 12-hour shift; 12 were V/D for over 3 days (meaning, shit started Tuesday or Wednesday), and plenty of time to be seen by their GP.  I also had two dogs for itching, lol.

Most of these people are the same who complain about the increased costs.

I really don't get it...What country are you working in?>but I'm scared the environment will be the same or worse.

Well, I can't really say as I don't know about the environment in Mexico, but I was able to *guess* that you were not in the US just based on what you described. 

Everyone has horror stories, but your comment stood out as 'extreme'.  I would wager that the situation is better in the US (assuming your experiences are the norm for Mexico).>I'm not even sure a ""love and passion for animals"" is required,

I couldn't agree more.  

A love of medicine, science, curiosity, and problem-solving is far more important than a love for animals.  Keep in mind, many vets (historically, most), went into the field to work with livestock/equine.  You need to enjoy working WITH animals for most veterinary fields, but a love for animals... it may be a hindrance.Yeah, I am not willing to quit over this just yet.  

I was sending the notes to the techs that didn't write the histories, but that is a lot of work for me (checking what tech did the history, not always obvious, sending the message, then checking if it was ever finished (usually several days later)).

As of today, I am sending a list of incomplete notes to the office manager, letting her hunt down the responsible tech.  I am not finalizing the notes until the history is put in... I hope the extra work on her will light a fire under someone's ass to make this a priority.  

There is no way i can take my own history and TPR's without seeing a LOT less clients... but I guess that is an option... if I see less, the owner may make it more of a priority.>Could you alter you schedule so that you have the last hour (never works!🤣), the first hour, or lunch, to catch up on paperwork?

Thats next!  As I mentioned, I am sending a list of the notes that do not have histories done (from the previous day) every day to the OM for her to deal with.  

If it doesn't get corrected (and, to be fair, I am not talking about the occasional missed history, I am talking about +50% in a day!), I will be blocking off the last 2 hours of the day for ""Tech Appointment Catchup"", and then just going home.

While I am not going to quit over this, if the owner starts seeing blocked-off appointments at the end of the day, they may start taking a more active role in enforcing the rules.>and you don't have the information you need to deal appropriately with the patient and client?

To be clear, i am getting full/complete histories (everything I need to do my job), but they are not being put into the records.  By the time I get to it (writing my notes), I may not remember all the details - and I get stuck with incomplete notes/histories.  


>You might be seeing more clients, but you're leaving that much more work unfinished. I don't think that's a wise trade off. 

I agree!  I just feel like I should be the bottleneck (in regards to how many patients I can treat in a day), not support staff.  

Let me clarify, 'up to a point'.  I understand sometimes support staff gets overwhelmed, but we are talking about 12-15 wellness appointments a day here... not a busy ER.>So the offer is basically 140k base plus 20% production on service, 15% on products and 5% on prescription.

I do not understand this... are you saying they are offering you 140k base **PLUS** 20% on services?  I mean, if so, I would be all over that in a heart beat!

Or is it a prosal model, where you are getting 20% production on services... with a 140k base (because that sucks!)>No! It’s 140k guaranteed but I don’t know how much do I have to pull in before the production kick in. The 20% is only on top of what you makes more. 

Yeah, thats what I thought.  I think that sucks TBH.

Basically, you have to produce 700K for the hospital (175K per quarter) in services before you see a production check.    


>This is pretty standard pro Sal stuff.

It is, but you said 140k **+** 20% (thats not standard prosal).  But I now understand what you mean.

I think ""20% production on service, 15% on products and 5% on prescription"" Sucks!  I get 22% on EVERYTHING except 15% on food and flea/tick products.

I mean, Cytopoint injections, Proheart injections, Apoquel, some Antibiotics, are a large % of your gross.  Unless you are doing a ton of surgeries, you are going to have a really hard time making production IMO.

Also, do labs count as 'services'!?  I assume so, but don't be sure.

I think 22% is probably the norm, the highest I ever got was 25%.

Another big question (and it's HUGE), but do your PTO days get pro-rated with respect to your production?!  If not, its not PTO (and you are losing money when you take your time off)When I first got out I would jump at the chance to come in and shadow with an experienced vet and do any procedure that I wasn't 100% comfortable with.  I learned 90% of all the surgeries I currently do in the first 2 years after I graduated!

Now is your chance to grow as a new vet (it gets harder to learn (or want to learn) new things as time goes on).  Yeah, it's your day off, but it will pay dividends down the line.    
Perhaps (if you are willing), explain that you want to come in on your days off, but those particular days just were not possible.  Give him a few other options over the next week or two (or month) where you can come in and shadow/learn more advanced procedures. 

You cannot rightfully expect him to use HIS time to help you when you are in trouble on YOUR time.  Sure, we all get in over our heads, and some help is always going to be needed (even for older vets), but you shouldn't expect someone to come running to help you when you (and you will) drop a pedicle if you are not willing to put in the extra time now.>If the only surgical mentorship/training offered is unpaid extra days of work that is not appropriate. 

If I am teaching a new grad to do routine surgeries, then I am not working (basically the same as coming in on my day off).  It's one thing to jump into surgery to help with something, it's another to be training them.  It sounds like OP needs a bit more help than the occasional question.  

NOTE: I am not suggesting that I wouldn't help a new grad do a complicated/non-routine surgery, but just as I am willing to take my time to help them, so should the new grad use their *personal* time to learn.Not really.  Unless a level of mentoring and hand-holding was baked into the contract (or employment agreement), your boss would expect you to do all reasonable procedures from the day you were hired (and OHE's and IVC placement are certainly reasonable skills for a licensed veterinarian).  

I personally wouldn't hire a vet that only had one spay under their belt (unless there was an agreement that the vet wouldn't be doing surgeries).>he is paying me graduate salary and should expect me to learn and build a foundation with good skills not rushed in and overworked just so I can say I did it in few weeks.

I am not exactly sure what that means... graduate salary?  Is that like an internship/training i.e. took a pay cut for increased mentorship?  If so, then my previous statements should be disregarded and yes, they should be teaching you while you are working (not your off days).I've only done one in 15 years (meth head, was convinced he'd drown the dog).  I have no problem finding work...

Basically, is not an issue.

How many convenience euthanasias do you think we see?  Personally, I only get 1 request every year or two.>it's that they're rude and insubordination. 

Came here to say this!>After being subjected for decades to the writing on medical records, on VIN, etc, I can't believe a veterinarian composed this.

What can't you believe?  Even if you disagree with the statement; it was incredibly well-written, insightful, and concise.  

If you don't agree with the premise/conclusion, state a rebuttal (hopefully citing facts).>I'm assuming that most of the downvotes are from DVMs (or VMDs) offended by what I wrote.

I see now what you meant in your previous post.  I (and I suspect a few others based on the downvotes), misinterpreted your comment regarding the OP.  I really thought when you wrote 'I can't believe a veterinarian composed this' it was in regard to the OP's statements/arguments.  

I now see its a 'tongue and cheek' reference to our (generally) poor writing skills.

I think your joke flew past a few of us ;-)>I would try reaching out to faculty at whatever university you went to and see if you can get in contact with their radiologist for suggestions (I did this for cardio a few years back).

Appreciate it!""We tried...""Thank you for this.  I should state, I am not really worried about being sued (they declined BW, symptomatic care (which would have included treatment for pancreatitis)  and additional testing.

I read (most, ok, some!) of the article you linked.  I agree, that error rate is high... but, I assume the cases coming into AMC have a much higher acuity than what most radiologists are reading!  Also seems like the ones most missed were PE's (which, I always thought were really hard to catch on radiographs).  I wonder how many other radiologists would have 'caught' it with the same presenting history and information.

I am also surprised them lumped so many different imaging modalities in the study (CT, AUS, rads, MRI, ect.).  It makes for a GREAT study, but a bit of informational overload for the common practitioner!    


>Missing a GI obstruction would be an example. On the flip side, incorrectly diagnosing a GI obstruction leading to a negative surgical explore would arguably also be a major misdiagnosis

I am going to cut you guys a little (A LOT) of slack on this one.  I've seen SO MANY missed GI obstructions, that were (more) obvious on rads 12-24 hours later.  

Lately I've been getting around surgical explores by referring to them as ""Diagnostic laparotomies"", I tell them its generally less invasive than a spay, unless I find something.   Offer CT (3k) vs. surgical explore <1k.  Taking biopsies is another issue altogether... Cats, older dogs, almost always.  2-3 year old lab or pitty, I leave it up to the owner, but generally recommend against it (unless I see something on gross examination)  

I feel like diagnosing a GI obstruction on rads would be my 'veterinary superpower' if I could pick one!

Thank you for the link and reply, I am going to read it more carefully when I have a bit more time!>I think it's unethical to not tell them, because what if they make you an offer and you fail again? That will screw them over.

I mean, they know that the OP is taking the test, and they are making an offer (obviously) contingent on OP passing it...  I say obviously, because they are hiring a licensed vet, can't be licensed vet in the US without passing the NAVLE.

Where is the ethical concern here?I think it depends on where you go... I mean, if you open a shop across the street, they will probably try and do something.  If you are straddling the radius/cut-off, they will probably ignore it (at least I would think so).>\#2 is that vets compare themselves to human doctors, who tend to make a lot more despite similar schooling. It is a natural comparison to make if you are looking for a reason to complain, even though ultimately they work in two very distinct ecosystems.

Thank you for this.  I remember learning that our business model more closely resembles that of dentists, not MD's.

People also forget that they (MD's) do 3-10 year residencies, often working 60-70 hours per week (LoL at ACGME guidelines), making 60-90k a year (depending on location, ect) - all while their loans compound.Man, vet school is hard enough.  I would have LOVED to have lived and worked in Europe, but there WILL be differences between your education in Europe vs. US (not better/worse, but different) - do you really want to be 'that guy' who spells esophagus oesophagus?!

I just think, if you are planning on practicing in the US, you will be better prepared for practicing in the US by going to LSU - local diseases, laws, terminology, NAVLE prep, ect. - if you are considering practicing in Europe/UK, then obviously, Royal Vet College all the way!

And as others have said... 120k!

I would totally consider an internship/residency over there if possible!>I know that I can’t thrive here, I’m just surviving.

It's worse than you think.  You are picking up bad habits that will follow you through your career.

Get out.  Get out now!It really depends on the severity of your disability, but in general, there are many facets of veterinary medicine that you can go into where your disability may not be a (major) issue.

I would say, if you can't stand for long periods, GP and/or surgery would be much more difficult.

If you are blind, you have a tough road ahead of you (but, I recall a few blind vet or med students that graduated, although I don't know what their work life would be like).

If it's a learning disability, well... really depends on the extent/severity.I am not sure exactly what an *animal health technician* is.  If it is like a CVT (Certified Veterinary Technician) - US term afaik, I know many who have done online programs (including PennFoster), but they all have a 'hands-on' component (I think they hook you up with the names of hospitals in your area, but I am not sure).  

In regards to *Will these be accepted by employers?*, I think they only care that you pass your licensing examination.

The Vettech forum would probably be able to give you more information.You best bet is going to be in your junior year.  Right now, as a sophomore, you are just another face in the crowd (still doing your basic sciences).  By your junior year you should be taking more detailed courses, the class sizes should be smaller, and your professors will have a better idea who you are.

At that point, I would simply approach one after class and talk to them.

I am not saying you can't get one as a sophomore, but it would be pretty difficult.

Also, most colleges offer a summer research program where they set you up with a professor/lab.>One speaker presented a host of studies that essentially said nothing you do improves the course of acute diarrhea (metro, probiotics, bland diet, etc).

>Prazosin, on the other hand, is something I don’t touch anymore. Even before there was new data, I was always shocked at how many people prescribed it without checking a blood pressure first, especially in sick UO kitties. Make it make sense.

But, I suspect Prazosin is still new(er) and hip, metro is old and dull.

I came out of vet school when corticosteroids were shunned.  I ONLY used them for immunosuppression (IMHA, IMTP, salvage lymphoma cases) because the pendulum swung too far in one direction (it has since centered a bit, thankfully).

Thanks for your input!  Looking forward to VECCs next year (sad I missed it the last two years).>I think it all just boils down to the fact that we’re human and have our own biases when it comes to what we think works and what we think doesn’t.

I think you are absolutely right!

>However, when the tramadol papers came out a couple years ago... one doc kept dispensing it to his ortho cases while the other readily switched to other options. Why?

Yup.  

&#x200B;

>Despite doing our best to remain impartial, sometimes we stick with things because, well, we think they work and/or it makes our lives a little simpler/easier. Definitely keep an eye on any new studies coming out that help verify findings because studies aren’t always infallible, but if this is the one bit of medicine you can’t seem to sway from because it works for you and your patients and you don’t have sufficient evidence to prove that it’s not the best choice, then keep on keeping on.

I def. reach for it less.

Incidentally, and this is completely anecdotal.  Three of the doctors (new grads) never used it when they started, I assume because they just graduated and were taught not to.  Over the last year, two of them have been using it more (based on clinical feedback and lack of improvement with their diarrhea cases).  

I am sure, in time, a happy medium will be found.>Everyone uses anecdotal medicine though

right one!

&#x200B;

>What's the best way to treat an aural hematoma?

Well, let me direct you to this paper... (I better keep my mouth shut, I might give some young resident an idea for their thesis...)>Anecdotal experience aside, why do you find yourself holding on to Metro? Is it because you worry about the health of the pet, or the flack from a client if you don't prescribe it or because, gasp, the diarrhea is still happening after day 2? Something else?

Ergh, this is more anecdotal evidence unfortunetly.

We have 3 new grad doctors that NEVER prescribed metronidazole for their diarrhea cases.  Over the last 2? years, when I saw their recheck diarrhea cases for not improving, (many) improved when I gave them metro.

Now, there is def. selection bias here (as the ones that improve I didn't see...)  But it happens more than naught.

&#x200B;

>I'll point out that you didn't really come prepared to argue your stance FOR metro in your meeting

You are absolutely right, and I wasn't trying to prove the efficacy of metronidazole - more the use of cherry-picking of data/papers to prove a point.

&#x200B;

>It's really good you're doing self reflection like this. You're not a dinosaur, you're just trying your best to find reasoning for how to make your medical decisions.

I appreciate that.  I often come off as combatitive or argumentative (online and in RL) with people, but this is how I process things and make changes.

I remember when I was a baby vet (first year out) telling boarded criticalist that I would ""have to look into that"" when he told me it was 'ok' to give a dog with heart disease a little pred (I was convinced that any pred was contraindicated in dogs with heart disease).  **I am thankful he was so cool, he just smiled and said ""let me know what you find out"".**>I’m not a vet just an owner, but trying to understand. Do you mean Metronidazole given to a patient with diarrhea when Giardia is present or suspected? Or is Metronidazole given for the symptom of diarrhea itself?

I am referring to its use in diarrhea by itself.  Metronidazole is not a good first-line treatment for giardia.I know what you are saying, and I am not blaming people for using it (prazosin), but I wonder what allows some 'papers' or ideas to gain traction while others are ignored.  


>A few days of straining to urinate/not urinating might.

and that's my point, Prazosin seems to offer nothing more than a false sense of security.  

>(eg we were told at 4pm fri dec 23 we had to provide our own coverage the 24th to 25th overnight).

I've seen that happen more and more lately.  Not sure why, but while GPs are slowing down, ER's are getting slammedI may have mistyped, I love and use Gaba quite a bit, but, I see a lot of dogs going home on JUST gabapentin for (I kid you not) post-op analgesics.  The argument... 'owner declined BW and I require it for nsaid use'.These are other local vets (when I am working ER), so don't know, but regardless

I don't require bloodwork for all surgeries, do you?No need to apologize!

>Scrolling Reddit and ended up in vet subreddit.

Been there done that!

>Both vets I see clinic policy is bw in last 30 days and Two emergency vet clinics do it too.

Different vets will have different opinions on the matter.

My 2 cents:

\- Sometimes bloodwork is necessary, regardless of the surgery (sick patient, history of organ dysfunction, etc.)

\- Sometimes it is good based on the breed (Dobermans can have a bleeding disorder, Yorkies and other small breeds are predisposed to liver shunts)

\- Sometimes it's necessary based on the surgery you are doing (liver biopsies, splenectomies, ect)

\- Sometimes age plays a role; older patients have an increased risk of a relevant problem

But... in young healthy dogs, for routine (and some non-routine) procedures, I feel like its unnecessary.  Sure, its 'good' information to have before going in, but if you have suture up a laceration or remove a ruptured eye, are you going to not perform the surgery because an owner refuses bloodwork?  Some people will, but I feel you should just document the clients refusal and do the best you can.

Interestingly enough, there is a big move in human medicine to NOT do full blood panels on young healthy individuals prior to most surgeries.  Oftentimes times they find things that are completely irrelevant and complicate matters unnecessarily (they call them 'incidentalomas'.

In human medicine, they may get a glucose, BUN, and PCV (to check for anemia), but that's it!

In 15 years I don't think I EVER found an abnormality in an otherwise healthy individual that changed my anesthetic protocol/halter surgery.  Now, I have found things that need to be worked up further and that may lead a legitimate problem, but they rarely affect immediate surgery.

People def. will disagree with me on this, and I will be happy to discuss further if there is interest, but full bloodwork on otherwise healthy individuals (I feel) can be optional.

NOTE: I also work with a population where bloodwork might increase the cost of the surgery by 33-40%, placing the needed surgery out of a client's budget.As others have said, I will add a common real-life scenario...

Do you inject midazolam IV and start them on Phenobabribal/Keppra/KBr... or put some sugar water (dextrose) on its gums (later IV)?>Probably insulin  
  
(Units are important)

All joking aside (I deleted my last comment as I think it derailed the conversation); it's good to know that different people measure it differently.

I don't have a glucometer on me, but I think we (at my hospital and our lab) measure it in mg/dL.Just curious, but what is the low/high range and what units?  I really thought it was standard/universal (I know some labs report values in mmoles, is this one of them?)

And yeah, I am used to mg/dL (\~70 - 140 being the range we shoot for)A little unsolicited advice?

You are basically looking for a GP (based on your listed 'responsibilities').

Most shelter vets are shelter vets so they can just do surgeries (from my perspective, to avoid the public), and maybe see the occasional coughing dog.  You are asking for a lot more.  

Before I get flamed, I know a lot of career shelter vets do it all (and enjoy all aspects of the job), but most? just want to show up, bang out a few dozen surgeries, then leave.Ahh, thats pretty resonable then.

Perhaps the ""responsibilities"" section might need to be revised?

&#x200B;

>Responsibilities: ... **Examine shelter animals and recommend treatment plans**. **Examinations and documentation for animal abuse cases**. **Perform vaccine clinics for the public at the shelter’s discretion**, typically once per month. **Public wellness checks are at the discretion of the veterinarian**. It is important that the veterinarian work in a team like atmosphere with the shelter staff, have an open mind in developing treatment plans, and have compassion for shelter animals.

Because the added duties would have turned me off back when I did shelter med.>Examine shelter animals and recommend treatment plans. 

That is a shit ton of work right there, and certainly not reflected in *that’s all our shelter vet does (surgeries and goes home).*

&#x200B;

>Examinations and documentation for animal abuse cases

I did one ASPCA case that went to court... Hate to be 'that guy', but I will never call the cops or report someone for abuse again.

I lost several days of work for testimony/deposition, had my home and office vandalized (before I learned to change my address on my state license), and then the case got dropped... no explanation.  Fuck that.

&#x200B;

>Perform vaccine clinics for the public at the shelter’s discretion

I never really understood vaccine clinics... like, are you performing a PE?  Keeping records? If not, why does a vet need to do it?  probably a moot point

My point is, if none of these are sticking points for you, just limit the responsibilities to surgery.I agree with the sentiment, but (I've recently gone down this same rabbit hole) they all claim to have superior results and use statisticians far smarter than I to back up those claims.

I think you should go with the one that uses the most AI (not the best, the most... I want to see ""powered by AI"" on the damn box in **bold** letters!) /s>We have a couple small animal GP clinics. We need another vet but can't seem to find much traction. Would 170k, 4 days a week, one Saturday a month, well staffed, well equipped progressive privately owned practice 45 min from center of major metro interest anyone?

I mean, it sounds good!  

170k might be great, but it might suck if I was seeing 15 minute appointments all day and squeezing in surgeries, staying late to finish last minute walk-ins, etc.  

If its salary based, how do you guys handle after-hours/emergencies?  Like, dog fight 30 minutes from closing?  Emergency surgery over lunch?

That has always been my sticking point before going straight salary, especially in a busy practice.300k - 1.3 million - Depending on those pesky variables you mentioned 

Note: I assume you mean gross production (that the hospital makes)But really, full time? part time?  >60 hours per week?  Weekends?  Full schedule?  Doing surgeries?  ER/urgent care? High or Low CoL? tech:Dr?  So so SO many variable that really do effect the end number, its pointless to just guess.>I know they anticipate losing some money on a new grad w/ pro sal and chalk it up as an investment

No they don't.  They expect you to go above your base.  I've never missed my base (starting from year one (75k, 14 years ago).  There is really no reason you shouldn't make your base (unless they offer you something ridiculous)... even as a new grad.I really think you are putting more thought into this than they are.  They are going to offer you the lowest they think they can to get you to sign up.  You are going to *try* and get the highest.

For your first year out, just take the highest-paying job that offers you what you want in terms of mentorship, clientele, and workplace environment.  

If you don't like it, you leave (preferably stick it out for a year).  In that time you will be in a position to know what you can produce, what you are worth, and what you are looking for. 

Data and numbers are great, but ultimately, they don't mean much.  If one place is desperate for a vet, they will offer more than they should.  If another is inundated, then they may lowball you.>Every employer rep (private and corporate) who came to talk to us in school about negotiating salary stressed to us that they don't expect new grads to make production during their first year

Do not trust these people!  It is their intention (fiduciary duty) to get you to undervalue yourself.

Take a straw poll, and see how many of your classmates did not exceed their base after the second quarter!  I would be shocked if the vast majority only had one-quarter of negative accrual.    


>(which is why they recommended that we always ask for no negative accrual)

I would always ask for no negative accrual (there is too much outside of your control to not ask for it) - it has nothing to do with being a new grad.

Think about it from their perspective... why do they even tell you that ""*stressed to us that they don't expect new grads to make production during their first year*"" - what is their motivation?Did you open your own ER practice?  I can't imagine how at this point (the start-up capital must be HUGE).>It is even worse with organic producers. Believe it or not

Oh, I believe it. 

I had a classmate who ran/runs a farm.  He has two business; An organic and traditional (cows, not sure if dairy or meat); 

He said that when one of his organic animals gets sick, he walks it across the street to his other farm so he can treat it appropriately (obviously they don't go back).

He said a lot of people who can't do that, the animals suffer in the hopes that they get better.

I don't know if the rules regarding the treatment or care have changed in the last few years, this was a decade ago.Agree, 2.5 weeks doesn't sound like a surgical complication;   


>Was there anything I could've done to prevent that, especially given that the hematoma developed so far after the surgery?

Exercise restriction is the only/best thing I found to prevent scrotal hematomas.  They are common enough that I tell any big, active, older dogs that its *almost* to be expected if they cannot maintain strict exercise restrictions (but also tell them in advance that its usually nothing to worry about.  Some cold compresses, nsaids and abx and the body will reabsorb.

Of note, I've never had to drain one.>These are my stats thus far: 28 cat spays - 2 cut pedicles (from too much ligature tension), 1 slipped ligature off the uterine body. 15 dog sprays - 3 slipped ligatures off of ovarian pedicles.

That sounds like a lot of complications TBH...

Do you mean the ligature slipped off the pedicle while you were tying it, and then you placed another?  Or were these post-op complications (if post-op, you need to look into your technique (are you tying ""modified"" miller knots?)  - I put modified in quotes because I have NO idea what a regular Miller knot is...

If these are interop complications that you immediately address, then, ergh, its normal.

> a ligature slipped off of a 50 lb dog’s pedicle today

A 50 lb dog spay is (especially if older/fat) nothing to sneeze about - and can be a tough surgery that I (15 years out) don't like doing and is not easy!I agree with what the doctor today said (about grabbing the pedicle, not the suture) when releasing it back into the body.  It doesn't hurt to give it a little wiggle to make sure its tight, but I wouldn't hold it. 

Also, are you placing the ligature in the crushed tissue from your hemostat?  I presume so.  I use a three-clamp technique (two proximal to the ovary, one at the proper ligament), I also cut just distal to the second hemostat before placing my ligature.  That scares some newer vets, but I find once you get the ovary out of the way, it easier to make a secure knot.

That said, it sounds like you have an issue with your ligatures.  In my experience, that's due to inadequate exposure of the tissue.

Some new grads have been taught not to break down the suspensory ligament (and somehow suture everything intra-abdominal...)?  I have no idea how they do that.  Are you breaking down the suspensory to get better exposure?  I know that even after breaking down the suspensory, you cannot always get great visualization - but it helps.> I did two more 50 lb fat pitties who were in heat today after multiple litters

Where the fuck are you working? LoL

Life it too short (at least for me) to be doing in heat spays... Unless you are working shelter medicine, I dunno.

I am glad you found a technique that works and I could be of some help!

All joking aside, this is great surgical experience for you.  This is the part of your career where you will be the most adventerous and likely to advance your skill set, so keep it up!Wait, what schools are 340k in just tuition?!

Is this a Canadian thing!?>because I did not wanted to make a bigger incision.

Every surgical complication I've ever had from a spay was due to an inadequate incision... How big do you make it?  As big as it has to be.  End. Stop.

Never worry about the size of your incision>The owners didn‘t want any „tests“ and were very firm in their expectations and I was too insecure to „stand my point“ if that makes sense

It is NOT your job to convince anyone of anything.  I wholeheartedly believe that your job is to give them their options, explain the options, and (in my opinion), rank the options

1. Gold standard diagnostics with treatment
2. Empirical/symptomatic treatment (no diagnostics)
3. Benign neglect

The only time I am heavy-handed is if I really believe that not doing something is tantamount to abuse.  

The bleeding thing... I've been there.  I actually went BACK to double ligating (after 5-10 years of single ligating my pedicles I started to double ligate (even though I don't believe you should/was taught not too)) - but started doing it for the piece of mind.

You will have more of those (if you continue to cut), just going to have to take your time, so that when you are stressing something later, you know you did everything correctly.I guess the idea was that if you did it correctly the first time, why do you need two?

I remember learning it during a shelter medicine CE program I took right after I graduated (I think it was part of the ASPCA's Humane Alliance program and was taught by a boarded surgeon; his rationale was something along the lines of

*'we teach vet students to double ligate because they are green and need the confidence, but as a skilled veterinarian, there is no reason/need to do it'.  --* I AM PARAPHRASING HERE

I also recall something about compromising any ligation distal to the knot.  ie, if you have a secure knot, but then you tie another (less secure knot) proximal, well, if that knot fails, you have a point of failure proximal to your (more) secure knot...>F that I do a millers AND a second ligature because it helps me sleep better

Pretty much what I ended up doing... 

I was just giving the rationale because I was askedLooks like it was written by ChatGPT...Doesn't matter if you're capable,

>I don't really like medicine or biology

You really need to reevaluate WHY you want to be a vet - because if its because you want to 'help animals'; there are PLENTY of other ways that are easier and will be more rewarding than a job that you will not enjoy.

EDIT to add: Have you worked or volunteered at a veterinary hospital?  If so, why do you think you want to be a vet?My go-to response for these people...

'My job is to provide you with your options and help you make an informed decision.  If you have any questions about the options I presented to you, please feel free to ask.' 

::leaves room::All of your questions are going to be based on your specific negotiations regarding your comp package.  Days off, days/week/month, PTO, ect.

It will depend on how good you are, how badly they need you, and the CoL of the area.  

Some things (from experience) are generally non-negotiable (for some reason, non-competes tend to be one of them) with some corporations.  

But salary, schedule, PTO, perks are all on the table.Are you a veterinarian?

I always thought that during a buyout it would be a great time to renegotiate your compensation.  The last thing they want is to loss an established vet during the transition.

Also, I've heard of situations where the owner will personally pay good money to keep associates on (apparently, a lot of time the sell price is contingent on associate vets staying on for X number of months, rarely is that made public and even more rarely are the associates justly compensated).

The value of the clinic is in no small part due to you and the other doctors (that is why these corporations never start a clinic from the ground up).

Personally, if it was me, I would wait until right after it changed hands (obviously, not sign anything).  Once it was corporate owned, and the schedule set up... inquire about your new compensation package.

I mean, you wouldn't start a new job for the same salary?!  Why would this be any different?

Consider older doctors, near retirement, since newer grads want to make money quickly to pay off loans and start their lives/families.

You mean similar to a human pathologist?  I'm not sure of the specifics, but the answer is most probably no -- veterinary medicine is generally lower paying than human medicine at all levels.

Your other questions are kind of moot, since becoming a pathologist is about 8 years away, and a lot can change by then.  You might change your mind about a career path 2 or 3 times while your in vet school (most people do).You're an intern, so I'm not surprised you're tired all the time - it's an exhausting part of your education.  Residency will be too.Where are these programs......Through a vet clinic corporation?Yeah, playing a doctor in school is nothing like being the doctor, with all the responsibility for everything that happens - including everything done by the nurses or the assistants.   I think everyone is scared of that at the beginning.  I've been out over 20 years, and occasionally it still scares me.Vet school sucked, but it is so much better actually being a vet.

The risk is too high for problems, IMO.There are some standard positions for certain desired images, and there's probably at least a dozen different textbooks that lay these out in different species.  Then there are some species, and some animals with physical limits, that require some ""creative"" techniques and positions.   There's also the problem of getting animals to be still while imaging - particularly in patients that you don't want to, or can't, sedate, and that leads to a fair bit of manual restraint in small animal radiography and ultrasonography.  

Animals are obviously sedated for MRIs and CT scans, but that can be counter-productive for fluoroscopy - but these three techniques are more limited to specialty practices than to general practitioner vets.My friend does house calls for geriatric and palliative care.   Of course, it includes a lot of home euthanasias too.    I don't know if that would work as well in a clinic, as many owners of those pets like care at home.I would expect at least a cost of living increase every year.......Maybe a merit raise each year, maybe not, but I'd be the one to approach them about a merit increase with information to support that.I'm not even sure a ""love and passion for animals"" is required, but of course you do need to respect and want to care for them and try to improve their lives.  

For the vast, vast majority of vets (those working in clinical medicine), this is a medical degree - we are doctors, but our patients happen to be animals rather than people.  Medical doctors don't go to med school and become doctors because they have a ""love and passion for people"".   In my opinion, a clinical vet needs a curiosity and interest in medicine/surgery primarily, and (in small animal medicine) a respect for and desire to support the human-animal bond between owners and pets.Have you asked them to be sure to record their notes about it?

I know vets who've switched to all of those areas, but not me - I've been a GP for over 20 years and find it quite challenging enough ;)My clinic does surgeries 3 mornings a week.The vet that does surgeries that day does appointments in the afternoon, so how many procedures depends on what they are - a dentistry alone might take 2-3 hours, or it might take less than an hour, depending on how bad it is.  A mass removal can be 15-30+ minutes.  A mature canine spay, or an immature feline spay, etc.  The technicians book the surgery mornings and are very good at approximating the time involved for each procedure to keep her busy.  Turn around time between surgeries is minimal, because she typically works with 3 technicians, and they induce all patients into surgery (and monitor recoveries, as well).  

(I no longer do surgeries myself, so I'm doing appointments while she's doing surgeries.)Doing appointments all day, I kind of miss the mixed days of doing surgeries in the morning and appointments in the afternoon - I liked that variety.  A lot of time can be saved in doing procedures with enough talented staff, because otherwise one patient who's slow to recover can mess up a whole schedule if a tech is there monitoring and can't be working on prepping the next patient, etc.There are lots of books and videos.......it depends on what you want to learn.

Neither involve anything about visas and immigration, but are the routes for those who graduated from vet schools that are not accredited by the AVMA (like your school).> the university where I studied is accredited by AVMA

No, the vet school in  Ecuador is not accredited by the AVMA ([https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2024-02/colleges-accredited-12-23.pdf](https://www.avma.org/sites/default/files/2024-02/colleges-accredited-12-23.pdf)) .

Unless you graduate from an accredited school, you'll need to go through ECFVG or PAVE.> Is it because I said no to coming on my days off? Im just setting my boundaries. 

Yes, and I think you set your boundaries in the wrong place.  You say you're trying to learn and improve, but you twice told him that you weren't willing to put in any personal time to learn and improve.   He has a right not to expect you to work on your days off, but he was asking to come with him to learn on a day off, and I understand why he sees your unwillingness to do that as frustrating.   He's reasonably expecting you to continue learning when you're off the clock - especially being as new in the profession as you are - so I think you're shooting yourself in the foot.   You are right that you don't have to do it on your day off, but don't expect him to be excited about your lack of motivation and interest in improving.  

If you'd been out 5 or 6 years and he made the same request, I'd have a different answer, but at 1 month post graduation you should be doing a lot of learning and improving both at work and when you're not at work.  

This is not the same as protecting your days off from having to do work for them, and he's not making any money off of the time he's asking you to donate.>It’s not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning on their days off. 

I agree - it's also not reasonable to expect a new grad to only be learning when they're on the job.   Or, to put it another way, I wouldn't want to hire a new grad who only wanted to learn when they were being paid.   New grads are entitled to refuse to take learning opportunities when they're not on the clock, and owners are entitled to not find that very appealing or impressive.  That means new grads have a choice:  They can be excited to learn and improve to help their career, or they can refuse to take the opportunity to learn and improve when someone isn't paying them to do so.deleted>If you're only getting one day a week off

The post said they work 4 days a week and one night on call.Not unless that's what they were promised in their negotiated contract.  It's not a requirement of all bosses and all clinics to do that, and if that was an expectation of the OP, they should have made sure to include those specifics in their contract.  

If not, the boss had a reasonable expectation that a professional new to the profession would take it upon themselves to continue to learn and improve themselves.  If they don't want to take that responsibility themselves, they'll be a lot less attractive as hires because they'll seem a lot less motivated and helpful.  

It seems the OP expects their boss to take personal time to help them - because when they're teaching, they're not working - but isn't willing to take personal time to help themselves.  Yes, there will be some people who will hire that person, but it really limits their marketability.No, that's not what it says, in my opinion.....It says they work ""4 days a week....and occasional full  weekends"".  To me, that means those 4 days a week occasionally include both Saturdays and Sundays.   I may be misinterpreting that, but that's how I read it.Not making it more complicated than it needs to be, and it's not about training, it's about motivation and personal responsibility.   Everyone has to accept the consequences of their choices and actions instead of wanting their cake and eating it too.  

And it certainly isn't personal - I'm neither a new grad, nor an employer.  

>Simply, employers train new grads on company time. That’s part of the deal.

There's more to be learned than can be learned on company time, unless you want a slow boat to improvement, that is.  So, a new grad can choose to get onboard that slow boat, but they shouldn't  be surprised if they're not as valuable an employee when they do.   

I'm not saying that this new grad has to take those opportunities.......I'm saying that they shouldn't be surprised if they're not as valued as an employee if they don't.Did you go to UNAM?

If you went to a different vet school, you'll have to either take the [ECVFG](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiQjuzimtSEAxUtrYkEHcQNC7UQFnoECBIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.avma.org%2Feducation%2Fecfvg&usg=AOvVaw2cJqz0MN8NAur5cJjPK9sS&opi=89978449) or [PAVE](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwiBoePWmtSEAxU6lIkEHROKA5AQFnoECBoQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aavsb.org%2Fpave%2F&usg=AOvVaw0D2l9tH5ASXyOHyMsXk_7h&opi=89978449) route to become licensed to practice in the US.I have no idea, but I know that UNAM is accredited by the AVMA, so graduating there is like graduating from an US school with respect to taking the NAVLE.I didn't have a Nerdbook, but in 3rd year we all made a pocket sized book in Anesthesia class -- we could put anything in it and use it during the exams, but it had to be small enough to fit into a lab coat pocket.  It started with notes and diagrams about anesthesia, but I think we all added to it from every class and in years going forward.  I continued to add to it once in practice, particularly for things I need to know quickly but don't use often, and for tips and tricks I picked up along the way.

I've been out almost 25 years, and I still use it occasionally, maybe once or twice a year.  In my first 4 or 5 years in practice, though, I used it at least weekly.Oh, yes!  An added bonus.Is this something you can hire a trustworthy teenager to do for minimum wage?  Give them a dedicated corner of an office and set them to work, while you're doing other things and making the clinic more money than you're spending on the transition?You should be able to get some used IV tubing from the clinic, after they've used it for SQ fluids or for a patient with a non-communicable disease.  If they don't want to give you any used (as technically it's used medical equipment), ask to buy a set from them - it will be cheaper than retail.  Take a towel and roll it into the size of a leg that you want to practice on, lay some IV tubing along it, and cover the tubing with gauze and ""vet wrap"".   The more ""vet wrap"" you use, the more difficult it will be, so start small and work your way up.

That was the kind of model I used in vet school, eons ago, but it still works.> In Korea, you train at a local hospital and then open a small veterinary clinic, but I'd like to hear from other countries.

Clinical veterinarians who are general practitioners (no upper level degrees) often practice for 30+ years in the US and Canada, where there is right now a shortage of vets.>In the US a doctorate is required for any practicing veterinarian

No, a veterinary degree is not a doctorate.  A doctorate requires original research, not just being  called a ""doctor"".The devil is in the details - i.e. what you consider ""convenience euthanasia"".....by most people's definition, very few clinics will do a convenience euthanasia, and those are limited to shelters.  But I don't know what circumstances you consider ""convenience euthanasia"".   

I probably only get a request for one every few years - it's usually not an issue.It's so variable, because different children have different knowledge and experiences around death.   I always ask the adult if they're sure their child should be present, and usually they tell me that they've been talking about it at home already, or they've been through it before.  Then I explain what I'm going to do, and what will happen.  I explain this anyway, even with just adults in the room), but I'll do it slower and watch the child so I can stop if it looks like they've got questions or something to say.   Because I am comfortable with what I'm doing and think it's a good thing, I believe that ""rubs off"" on the people in the room.It never goes away, but it happens much less frequently and you get better at dealing with it.  I've been out almost 25 years and I still go through it occasionally (like once or twice a year).

>I feel like I take 2 steps forward and a step back every time. 

That's perfectly normal and very common as a newish grad (out less than 5 or 6 years)

You are right that you can't continue a career in high anxiety mode all the time, and it's something that plague a lot of new and newish grads, because vet school pre-selects for Type A, high achieving people, often with perfectionist tendencies.   You might need to seek some counselling and/or peer support for that - learning how to manage your anxieties.  The solution is not to never make mistakes or never take that step back, but on accepting imperfection and learning from those mistakes.  

Vets4Vets is a charitable organization that offers free and confidential peer support to any vet or vet student:  [https://vinfoundation.org/resources/vets4vets/](https://vinfoundation.org/resources/vets4vets/)   You should consider contacting them......They also might be able to set you up with a mentor, maybe long-distance (mentors don't have to be in your clinic)What I would recommend as the most help (and will probably help you in undergrad too) is to learn the Greek and Roman roots of words used in medicine and science.   I don't know of any books in particular, but rather than looking specifically for vet med books, look for that instead --- learning those roots and some terminology now will make learning new stuff a little less new in the future.In my opinion, the problem isn't that your techs don't trust you (which isn't that unusual after just 6 months out), it's that they're rude and insubordination.   If it were me, I'd be talking to my boss about their behaviour (more than their feelings).  It's OK not to trust you yet, but it's not OK to act the way they are.   What they should be doing is helping you to become a better vet, not insulting you and making presumptions about your work.> I didn't spend my entire life trying to be a vet.

In my opinion, that's a GOOD thing.  We need more vets who aren't so wrapped up in their lifetime goals of being a vet, and can bring a more well-rounded approach to vet med.  

&#x200B;

>I'm a non-traditional student that is older than most of my classmates and I had an okay (but not fulfilling) career before vet school. 

Sounds like me, when I was in vet school over 25 years ago.

&#x200B;

>I'm only interested in wildlife, exotics, pathology, research, one health, the stuff that 99% of my classmates don't want to do.

Great!  We need more vets doing pathology, research, and One Health.  Not doing what everyone else is doing is necessarily wrong, or on the wrong path.

&#x200B;

If you are still interested in public health as well as veterinary medicine, you could look into getting an MPH with a DVM.   There are some dual degree programs, such as this one: [https://onehealth.uoguelph.ca/dvm-mph/](https://onehealth.uoguelph.ca/dvm-mph/)> Do you mean transferring into a DVM/MPH program??

I have no idea if that's a thing or not, since it's not my area of interest.  But I just wanted to make sure you knew they were around  (which you did).If you don't want to be an owner, with the extra work and stress that involves, then don't be one - it's not something you should do unless you really want to.  It's not the only way to be proud or make money in the profession, as I think some people believe it is.  

Think of a veterinary business partnership like a marriage - you have to be complementary, supportive, and share common goals and values.   And that's only IF you want to be an owner.  It sounds more like you don't want ownership,  but your fiance does.Ask at your clinic -- not only will they have (or recommend) reliable sources, they will be happy to know you want to learn more to help your/their patients.I think you mean improving communication with your clients......While communication with your patients is important, I don't think they're sending your texts and emails.  

This situation is hugely dependent on your particular circumstances, but I'm going to guess that you're a small animal GP in a clinic.   Are you an owner or associate?   One of the important things is delegate, delegate, delegate - but that presumes you have enough talented staff to help you.   

Clients should not have your personal phone number or email address - all requests for communication should go through the clinic.   Your talented staff should address whatever they can (questions about appointments, flea/tick meds, food, etc), and then pass messages to you for the things they can't (medication refills or adjustments, etc).   

Some patients and clients will have complicated situations and need more time, but that should help with a lot of the volume.  Are there issues other than volume that are bothering you?Get a VIN membership - there are lower rates for new grads:  [https://www.vin.com/vin/default.aspx?pId=130&id=8286353](https://www.vin.com/vin/default.aspx?pId=130&id=8286353) 

It's the most valuable resource I have to help me in practise, and I still use it even though I've been out almost 25 years.It does have an area that describes diseases, with clinical signs, diagnostic tests results, and treatments, but it's not a paint-by-number algorithm where you can put in a case and it makes suggestions on steps.  There is a tool where you can put in clinical signs and/or test results, and it will give you differentials to consider.   There are also a group of message boards where you can post about a case to other vets (GPs and specialists) and get their thoughts on the case too.  

You can use it free for a month, so you should try it out.Texting.Cat behaviourist?  Do you enjoy trying to pin Jello to the wall?  LOL - just kidding, but cat behaviour is, ahem, unique.  The only route I know of to become an animal behaviour specialist is to become a vet and then do a residency in behaviour.  I'm sorry I can't help with any of the schools you've mentioned.The most common things that walk in a GP's door (IMO):

* acute vomiting and/or diarrhea
* itchy ears, often but not always with stinky discharge
* red eyes, with or without pain/itch
* acute lameness (if it's a back leg, it's a cruciate ligament unless proven otherwise)
* superficial skin infections, especially ""hot spots"" (moist superficial pyoderma)
* inappropriate urination (in the house (dogs) or outside the litter box (cats))

They vary in frequency depending on your location and the season.If you're going to accept any type of production-based pay, I recommend not accepting it in your first 6 months at least.   Know more about how the clinic runs, what kind of support you'll have, and the accuracy of their accounting methods before you accept being paid via production.>defining mentorship

What they think is mentorship and what you think is mentorship might be different things.  Probably are.  Sure, you want them to define it, but you need to define it to yourself first.  What do you want?   If you don't know what you want and think is ""mentorship"", then what they provide to you will be meaningless - you won't know whether it's good or bad or in between.  Some people will want a stepped introduction into appointments, others will just want someone available by text or phone, and others will want daily (or weekly) debriefing meetings.  

Also, remember that mentors don't have to be your boss (I think it's better if they're not your boss), and you are not limited to having an in clinic mentor.  There are other places you can look for mentorship, so if that's a weak point in the offer, don't worry because you have other options for support.>What is a good argument a new grad could make against negative accrual?

Don't make an argument against it -- just say NO.  

It's unfair and unnecessary, but don't discuss why with them.  Just refuse.  Tell them you won't consider a contract with negative accrual, and that's a red line for you.Unless you've got nice housing that you can include in the package to make up the difference in compensation, it's unlikely a vet would take less than $120,000 in a high cost of living area.I can't offer tips without knowing why you're spending longer, because there are lots of possible reasons and solutions - however, what you're describing is very common for new grads.  

Think about where your time sinks are......Are you going back to look at things multiple times?  Are you spending time on client education that your staff could do (eg flea control or grooming)?  Are you struggling to keep clients focused and not meandering in conversation?  

Or are you just taking longer at the things you need to do (take a history, do an exam, explain your findings and plans)?  Because that's very common and will get better as you get more experience.  

Sometimes ""multiple concerns"" are so many or complicated that they need to be broken into sequential appointments, but sometimes they can and should be handled at the same time - that's depends on what they are, what the plans are to deal with them, and the limits of the clients' compliance.>In my experience the places with 20 minute appointments are doing mostly routine/wellness work

It wasn't unusual for me to do appointments for everything, including lameness, PU/PD, whatever, within 20 minutes.......15 minutes is too short, but 30 minutes is too long, in most cases.  For me not as a new grad, but after about 4 or 5 years.  I now work in a place with 30 minute appointments, and I find myself chatting or cruising VIN in between because I don't need the extra time.  YMMV.Explaining things to clients will get better, faster, and easier with practice.  If you're really keen (and have tolerant friends) you can practice with friends giving explanations of the common diseases/situations you see.  When I'm faced with a complicated endocrine issue like Cushing's, sometimes I'll resort to ""....produces excess steroids, which - in a complicated way you don't need to understand - can produce weak muscles and bad skin"".  

As for looking up medication combinations or doses, and you're running out of time, don't be afraid to tell a client that you'll check on that later in day and call them about it; you don't want them to have to sit there waiting.  Clients appreciate you taking time to think about their pets' situation, and usually these aren't things that need to be fully wrapped up in those 20 minutes.   The only time I don't recommend that is if they live far (so won't want to come back for meds) and you can't call the prescription in to a human pharmacy.A thoughtful, handwritten card means more to me than any amount of food, even homemade treats.  I can look back on them during bad days -- they last a lot longer than a food treat.The first thing I think you should learn to prepare for vet school is language:  Learn the Greek and Latin prefixes and suffixes for medical terms.   I think that will go the farthest towards making it easier to learn the things you'll learn in vet school.> It’s the foundation of understanding anything in vet school. 

It means there's one less ""new"" thing you have to learn among all the other new things.Yes, relief work is a good way to travel as a vet, but you would need a license in every jurisdiction where you would practice.   That's pretty easy if you are travelling within the US, but it's much more difficult (probably unrealistic) if you wanted to travel to other countries.  Vets are licensed by the state, which is why many relief vets will stay where their current license allows them to work - but that's a choice you might do differently.  

I'm Canadian and only have a license for one province, because licenses here are pretty expensive (over $1000/yr), so I would need a significant amount of work (or a personal reason to go) in different provinces to make that worthwhile.......In the US, different state licenses are much more affordable, which would make it a more realistic option for a relief vet to be licensed in several (many?) states.  Of course, there will be other requirements for licensure in different states (maybe a local test or police screening), but you can decide if those things are worth it to you to travel to different states to work.  

I don't recommend relief work until you've been working as a vet for at least 3-5 years, though, but I do recommend it for vets who are of the right personality and skill level.  I did it for over 15 years, and enjoyed travelling all over the province to work.Veterinarians Without Borders usually require Canadian citizenship or Permanent Resident status.  A great organization, but they're not very transparent about that requirement when they advertise.>Vets beyond Borders

Vets **Beyond** Borders is an Australian organization, Vets **Without** Borders is the Canadian group.  

Easy mistake.When it comes to choosing schools, choose the one that is least expensive for you.  They all have equitable workload and stress, and the location is very much less important because of the workload and stress (and the fact that it's only 4 years).Some thoughts:  

> and the contents of an injection I was giving leaked out through the other end of the dog's skin.

I've been out almost 25 years, and it still sometimes happens to me.  Another thing that sometimes happens in long, shaggy-coated dogs is that I give an ""inter-fur"" vaccine and not under the skin at all.  Stuff happens - it's how you manage it that counts.  Did you see what happen and apologize that you needed to give another (or another partial) injection?  Acknowledging it to the clients helps them see that you're human and make mistakes, and can rectify them.  It won't work for all clients, but it helps minimize the issue.  

>The client said no to everything I offered but still complained that I hadn't done anything at all. 

Yeah, that will happen, unfortunately, which is why your records are very important - including what you recommended and what they declined.  I had a client complain to the clinic owner that all I'd done when she'd been in with her cat for urinating outside the litterbox was tell her that her cat was ""fat"".  Dr. Owner opened my record and saw a full page of notes regarding everything I'd discussed behaviourally and physically, with one line that say ""unable to palpate urinary bladder d/t obese"" so no cysto.""  (ultrasounds were uncommon back then.)

>told me to ""recommend"" instead of ""offering"" 

I have 3 levels of urgency when discussing testing for a pet:  ""I want to do this"" if the patient is at risk of a significant problem or disease, ""I recommend we do this"", if I think something will help us work up a minor problem, ""I can do this, if you want"" for something I think is unnecessary at this point in time, but might make an anxious owner feel better (eg FNA on a first exam mass that looks and feels like a lipoma).  

Ultimately, you will have to find the language that works well for you and communicates how you feel about it - and you don't have to use the same terms with every client or every situation.  I was taught to say ""need"" instead of recommend, but I could never get it to sound natural coming out of my mouth - I always felt I was lying.  So I found what worked for me but still served the patients, clients, and clinic owner well.

After just 3 months, these small complaints sound pretty minor......Sounds like you're doing well.Start by practising on dogs and cats that are under anesthesia.....When they're under GA, you should be able to see the tympanum as a white ""wall"".   Have someone hold the animal in sternal for you, as if they're on an exam table.  That will help you get used to the handling and curve of the canals.  I often have to pull the pinna out (i.e. away from the animal) a little to kind of straighten the curve out a bit.I did ""full time"" relief for over 15 years, and then switched to a part time job about a year or two before Covid.....I still do occasional relief work, but not much any more.   I put ""full time"" in quotes because doing relief was my only job, but I didn't work a full time schedule and some times of the year I was busier than other times.  I was solo, in that I didn't join an employment agency for relief work.

I don't think that being out for only a year is really long enough to have the experience necessary to truly be comfortable working alone (and in 95% of the time I was the only vet) because so much else is also new every week or every day - new staff, new facilities, new drugs on the shelf, new vaccine protocols, etc.   But, I also know everyone is different, including our experiences before we became vets.  

I think the first things you need to do is decide geographically where you're going to look for work (how far are you willing to travel?), and find out what you need to set up what kind of business entity (I'm in Canada, so if you're in the US, I can't recommend anything).   Then start spreading the news in that general area that you're offering relief services.   Set up at least an informational website (I don't recommend taking bookings via your website), and send out some emails.  

Here's the most important thing:  Set up some boundaries for your work, and start thinking about them now.  The more boundaries you have, the fewer number of possible clinics you can work, so don't go overboard on your list, but decide what you're willing to do and not do, and what lines you won't cross.  Is it about vaccine protocols (will you work for a clinic that vaccinates for everything yearly)?  Is it about declaw or tail docking surgeries?  Shelter work (some clinics do surgeries and euthanasias for local shelters)?   Will you work with back to back 15 minute appointments?  Etc......

Those are things you can and should discuss with the clinic owner or manager before you take the job, because once you're there you have a responsibility not to turn away a bunch of business because Dr. Owner does things that you don't like (or can't) do.  I personally recommend you go to visit every clinic before you decide to accept work there - not only does it show general interest and involvement, you might find things that might influence your decision to work there or not (such as whether all the equipment is operational, or whether there's a hole in the ceiling that often allows dust to rain down into the room below).What kind of unit do you have?  Some of the POCUS manufacturers have online support and online courses?I think most new grads feel like that, and I'm sure a new place will help with some of your feelings.  You may get some help from a free and confidential peer support organization called Vets4Vets that is available to all vets and vet students:  [https://vinfoundation.org/resources/vets4vets/](https://vinfoundation.org/resources/vets4vets/)>looking for other employment.

Good - what the clinic is doing isn't wrong, but it's not what you're comfortable with, and that's OK.  I don't see anything ""cagey"" about it, because the clinic is being upfront about what they're doing, and my guess is they've decided those are prospective clients that they are willing and able to lose, for reasons that you don't understand, which is also OK.   That's the owner's call to make.  

&#x200B;

>Additionally this practice seems to run prices well beyond estimates

That's why they're called estimates and not quotes.First thought:  Your mentor doesn't have to be your boss, and in some cases I think shouldn't be your boss.  You want your boss to be understanding of new grads, but if you don't connect well with that vet, there are other ways to find mentorship.   That vet say's he's willing to provide mentorship, but what he thinks of as ""mentorship"" and what you think of as ""mentorship"" might be two different things - you may not get what you want out of him, but that doesn't mean he's lying or misrepresenting himself.  

I recommend you don't work on any production based pay scheme, at least for the first year, because you simply don't know enough about the clinic or how it works to know how, let alone how much, you'll produce.   And I recommend you don't take a signing bonus -- it can become a real complicating tax issue if you don't stay (for one reason or another) and you're expected to pay it back.> I won’t be able to unless I become at least a tech or a veterinarian

Don't think of veterinary technicians like that - the job of technicians is valuable, but it's also very different from that of a vet.  It's not ""lesser"", so there's no ""at least"" about it.  The first thing you should do is spend some time in a clinic (or several clinics, if you can) so you can see what the jobs of vets and techs are.   Don't even think about schooling until you know for sure it's what you want to do.Yes, you'll probably be limited to volunteering occasionally.....You might be able to find weekend work at a local emergency clinic, doing cleaning or related jobs (that's often where people without experience start, doing what's known a ""kennel help"").In general, I will say it definitely gets better, but I am in Canada and so don't have any UK perspective.  However, I do know there is a free and confidential support organization for vets in the UK called VetLife:  [https://www.vetlife.org.uk/](https://www.vetlife.org.uk/)  

They may be able to offer you some support and perspective.In the US, a big part of the financial struggles aren't due to salaries, which have increased in the last couple of years, but to the student debt that most vets struggle with.  And don't forget that the ""average"" salary in your state includes GP vets, specialty vets, and vets that work in non-clinical jobs, such as government.  

You can increase your chances of enjoying your career by setting personal and professional boundaries early, and finding a job and boss that respect those boundaries.......Boundaries such as refusing to accept being verbally abused by clients or managers, and refusing to let clients bully you into doing something you think is inappropriate or below the standard of care, for instance>I was under the impression that we can terminate the relationship at anytime?

Probably not true, but it depends on your local regulations.   In many places, you can not fire a client while in the middle of treating their pet,  though sometimes there is a clause saying that you must give them enough time to find another vet to continue treatment.   

Whether or not you're still in the ""treating"" stage is a different question.Yup, assuming there's a surgery table with an adjustable height and an appropriate height chair or stool.  I've done vacation relief in a clinic where all surgeries were done sitting down (I actually liked it), and there was a stool in the exam room for the vet to sit on instead of stand.  It may not be common in clinics, but it should almost always be possible.It's always going to be difficult for someone as tall as you, but your staff can stand on steps if they need the table height that you do - however I'm not sure why you can't look around if you're sitting.I had two name tags, Dr. Name, and Name DVM. and I ended up using Dr. Name more often.  

Do NOT use Dr. Name, DVM.>RVT school does not transfer to DVM school in any way. I find this to be odd.....that none of this would be relevant to becoming a doctor.

It's relevant with respect to the information being related, but it doesn't transfer in the sense of serving as a replacement for a vet school course.Being ""too detailed"" and being too long are not the same thing........Are they recommending that you shorten what you write because it is repetitive or poorly written, or because it's too detailed and has information that they say they don't need.  

If they say it has extraneous information they don't need, then ask them specifically what about it is extraneous so that you can learn for future notes what you think they need or don't need.Maybe yes, maybe no.  The devil is always in the details - as well as in your local laws.  If you are ignoring red flags that the meds might be being used and abused by the owner (such as too frequent refills or ongoing non-response in your patient), that could be an issue.  Or not - it depends on your local laws.>""Hello, I have here your name is Joe"" ""yep that's me"" ""is it ok if I call you joe?""

That's hysterical!   I feel your pain......I was in my 30s in vet school and had been dealing with people and clients for over a decade.  I've learned what works *for me* and what doesn't.   I've dealt with something similar in a recent special project taught by people who've obviously read too many communication-for-dummies books.   Maybe it's helpful for the 22 year olds who've gone straight through school and never had a public-facing job in their lives?  

Take deep breaths to relax, and bide your time.  This too shall pass.> if you ask them what their pets diet is 

I've learned instead to ask ""what does your cat eat"", which may or may not be their cat food, and may or may not be what they're given.>when they actually have to talk to a real person.

And that's exactly why I think the admission expectations for vet school are all messed up.  People should be expected to have had some kind of public-facing work experience before getting in - not just animal and vet related experience.  They should value experience as waitstaff as highly as they value experience as kennel staff in a clinic (for instance).Is the practice manager also a veterinarian?  If not, and if there are no standard protocols that have been instituted for particular situations, then: no.   They can suggest a vet what to use, but they can't tell a vet what they should do medically - that would be practising medicine without a license.  

A practise manager can ask a vet to use a certain drug (""we have this in stock, can you use it instead of X?"") or can refuse to make a certain drug available in the clinic (""we can't stock X because it's too expensive and isn't used often enough""), but that's not telling the vet what to do.OK, it sounds like the PM might not have told the vet what they must use, but instead made a suggestion that they thought the vet should consider.   What language and tone the PM used is important here - if the PM said something like ""you should use this - Dr. Y had a similar case and it worked out well"", then it's a suggestion, and that's very different than ""that drug won't work, you should use this one instead"" which is directing the vet's treatment.

Did the vet think about it and use it instead because the vet thought the suggestion made sense, or did the vet use it instead because they felt they had to or they would face anger or discipline?  You probably don't know, but those are the things that determine if the PM was trying to practise medicine, or trying to make a helpful suggestion.Then that was wrong - but it's on the vet as much - if not moreso - than the PM.There's an AviMark help Facebook group - I've gotten some help from them before.Have you heard of VetLife?

It might take some forms and a little extra money, but it should not require any extra testing.  How much it costs might depend on where you want the grades to be sent.A love of animals had nothing to do with it -- I was interested in medicine, and didn't want to be an MD.Often at least 2 internships (i.e. 2 years) are required, because it's pretty competitive.....that might not be the case when the OP is graduating.I haven't done it, but I suspect the change of pace and money would be a tough road (faster pace, less money). 

Have you considered an ABVP specialty?  They're intended for those in practice, not academia:  [https://abvp.com/](https://abvp.com/)Everyone feels that way when they graduate, even those of us who graduated before Covid interruptions.  Imposter syndrome is something you learn to live and work with, and you will never stop learning for the rest  of career.....that's a GOOD thing.  In fact, it's one of the reasons I chose this profession. 

The truth is you know more than you think you do, even though you don't know as much as you think you have to.......you don't have to.  You need to remember the basics::  Get a good history, do a good general physical exam, and never be afraid to look something up or ask a question of your fellow vets or techs/nurses.  Not ""what do I do"", but ""help me learn X"".   Don't be afraid to excuse yourself from the exam room for a moment....When I graduated, a classmate said she never took a pen into the room with her so she'd have an excuse to leave and grab a minute or two to look something up, ask a question, or just think  while away from the clients' eyes.  These days, I'm sure you can come up with a similar reason to give yourself a few minutes outside of the exam room if you need it.    

I also suggest you take advantage of VIN's reduced rates for new grads [https://www.vin.com/vin/default.aspx?pId=130&id=8286353](https://www.vin.com/vin/default.aspx?pId=130&id=8286353) .   

You'll be fine.>Mentorship! Prioritize mentorship when looking at places

But please know what ""mentorship"" means to you, because it doesn't mean the same thing to everyone.  If you want a ""mentee"" relationship with someone make sure you and they have the same expectations of what that means.

Personally, I think it's better to have a mentor that does not work where you do, especially not your boss - there's a real power dynamic there that can impede a good mentoring situation.>and never felt the need for a power dynamic.

You misunderstand me if you think I said it's something you need.......Actually, it's something that exists, whether you want it or not, and I think it's something that isn't anything anyone wants in a mentoring situation.  

A vet can't escape that power dynamic in a mentoring situation within a clinic, but sometimes it's not healthy or not the best situation to mentor someone.  What if a mentee wants to deal with a medical situation in a way that is different from their boss, and doesn't know how to approach that situation?  What if one of the professional challenges they face is how to deal with a client who is also the boss' neighbour?  What if a mentee wants to discuss how to face the challenges of contract negotiation, or how to think about the future of their career and other job prospects?  What if they're worried about an ethical situation that they're not ready for their boss to know about?

Mentoring isn't training, and it isn't limited to delivering medical and surgical care.  There's no reason a mentor has to be in the same facility, because the real issues that need to be discussed aren't things that need to be discussed right then.  Training someone how to improve their speed in surgery isn't mentoring, and it's not mentoring to teach someone how to deal with a ruptured anal gland for the first time - mentoring is the big picture issue of discussing and encouraging someone how to solve those problems themselvesAre you a vet?  If so, VIN has lots of resources for new and prospective clinic owners.  If you're not a vet, are you sure that non-veterinary ownership of clinics is legal where you live?I feel your pain - I worked in a clinic once where that was a real problem, especially in small animals.  Even though there was a sign posted next to each scale giving the decimal version of ounces (eg 8 oz = 0.5 lb), so many people still got it wrong.  Our clinic has portable ones from Purina that offer options (kg in decimal, pound in decimal, pounds and ounces)......How big a scale are you looking for?

Have you searched for a DIGITAL scale?Don't forget the other possibility:  people are bragging.>The need for new veterinary schools is questionable?

Yup - there's a surplus of vets out there now.  Your area might be in dire need of vets, but that's not because there aren't vets looking for jobs, it's because most vets are looking for jobs in suburban and urban areas (for various reasons).  Adding more vets won't suddenly make more people want to live in different parts of the country, or live different lifestyles.  

I agree that there's a problem of distribution of vets, not a problem in the number of vets.>As someone who lives rural you absolutely can just not respond after hours. None of the vets here do.

That depends on where you practice -- in some places, vets have an obligation to respond after hours and they can be sanctioned if they don't.>For example the dakotas, nevada, new mexico, wyoming, etc. dont have vet schools so the only people moving to those states to be vets are people who left them for vet school originally.

Or those who got good job offers and are willing to move.   People move all the time for job offers.

>more and more people don’t want to use corporations and seek out mom and pop vet services

While that's true, ""mom and pop"" vet services are getting more and more expensive (to buy and to run).Nope - it's true in some (many?) states -- you have to have a provision for emergency care for your patients.  In many places, that's an emergency clinic within a reasonable distance, in other places it's offering after-hours service.It is absolutely normal to feel nervous.  We were all there  - including the other vets you'll be working with.  Prepare for your first week by reminding yourself of first principles:  Get a good history, do a thorough exam, and that baseline testing procedures (CBC/biochem and/or u/A and/or radiographs) are never wrong.  

Yes, ask other vets (and nurses) if you need help -- you'll look better for wanting to learn than for making a mistake or missing something......Approach them with the request because you want to learn, not because you needing help.

You'll be fine!If you're looking to do euthanasia house calls because you're scared to general practice work, I think it's a bad idea, but if you want to do euthanasia house calls because you think you'd enjoy the mobile work and limited scope (i.e. doing only one thing), then it can be a good thing.  

Don't for a second think you'll be avoiding ""crazy clients"", because you'd be exchanging them for ""crazy clients in grief"".  Don't do it because you think you'll be avoiding stress or needing to learn a bunch of stuff, because there's no such thing as a ""routine"" euthanasia any more than there is a ""routine"" ear infection or ""routine"" surgery.   It will create possibly more stress, not less stress, because it's every owner's worst day, and you have to be a bit of a counsellor as well as a vet.  

In other words, don't do it to avoid things, but do it if that's what you want to do........Providing euthanasia is, I think, one of the best, last gifts we can give to these patients and we're blessed to be able to provide it.>Take some time off, work relief 

No, I think relief work is absolutely the wrong thing for a new grad to do......You need a lot of self confidence and flexibility to work in new places all the time, with new staff and new drugs on the shelf.Yes, there are lots of places that will hire a vet who doesn't have an internship -- maybe not as a new grad, but certainly after a couple of years in practice.  I've done some ER work as a relief doctor, and worked with many vets who do not have an internship.There are 3 routes you can take to become a specialist in avian medicine and surgery......First is the most specific, an ABVP certification in Avian practice [https://abvp.com/](https://abvp.com/;) ;  As you mentioned, Zoo specialists also deal with birds [https://www.aczm.org/](https://www.aczm.org/) ;  finally, there is a veterinary specialty for poultry, but I don't think those are the kind of birds you meant [https://aaap.memberclicks.net/acpv-home](https://aaap.memberclicks.net/acpv-home) .  

Honestly, though, there aren't many avian specialists around, so many vets that work with birds (pets and rehab) have learned it by unofficially apprenticing with a vet who has decades of experience with birds.  More specialists would be awesome.Vet students get a free membership to VIN, and it has a lot of tools and advice specifically geared towards students:  [https://www.vin.com/students/default.aspx](https://www.vin.com/students/default.aspx)  Don't be put off by the UI - persevere and it's an amazing resource.  It's also ad-free, which means that the content is not affected by any ad revenue.   

I also really like the radiology resources on the University of Illinois website:  [https://vetmed.illinois.edu/imaging\_anatomy/](https://vetmed.illinois.edu/imaging_anatomy/)Go to your cheapest option, especially with that significant difference.It sounds like you need some professional help to give you some techniques that will help you to deal with things.  Even talking to someone monthly might be enough to both let out some anxiety and get feedback and help to repattern your thinking and priorities.Are you using a (modified) Miller's Knot?  I didn't learn the Miller's knot until I'd been out for over a dozen years, and I couldn't believe how much better and more secure they are (IMO).  

Be sure you're using the right sized suture, because if it's too big it won't be able to get as good security.

Good for you for addressing issues when you find them!  You'll be fine, but you now know why you should always check the gutters before closing.Unless companies changed their label instructions, it's ruinous to the vaccines.It also depends on killed vs. MLV - as I understand it, the MLV cakes are the most sensitive to remaining unrefrigerated.Can you make that brush any broader?

What you're describing is based on your personal experience at one vet school in one specific time frame -- but you're advising other people (who may or may not be like you) about what their experience will be like at one of over 3 dozen vet schools at some unknown point in the future.  I say that as a vet who will happily tell anyone who asks that vet school sucked, but it was what I had to do in order to become a vet, and being a vet is way better than being a vet student.  

I didn't deal with a toxic environment, though I did deal with a few instructors who were a-holes.  That happens in any school or workplace.  That's especially true in an environment where sometimes there are literally lives on the line, and the instructors have to be sure they can fix whatever problems the students create.

Perfectionism is the bane and lifeblood of veterinary medicine, and I think it afflicts students more than it does the instructors (who know how to deal with errors and imperfection).  Perfectionism among vet students, and then vets, is an unfortunate byproduct of the selection system (IMO), and is the source of a lot of the mental health problems in the profession (IMO).

Of course there's no support for all species groups -- do you have any idea how many species that would be?  You're upset because you didn't get instruction on the unique and limited species you wanted to learn about, but that disappointment is on you:  You should have - and could have - know about that before you went to vet school.  All you would have had to do was peruse the courses and ask a few questions on forums like this (or StudentDoctorNetwork) to know that ""niche"" species and areas of interest are really not covered in undergrad vet school.  It takes post grad and extra curricular classes to get to those parts of veterinary medicine.  

That ""you're not a real doctor"" situation you're facing sucks, but it's a reality of the profession and something you definitely could have known about because it's not new.  It's been that way for 50 years, and happens even to specialists.   You've obviously spent time shadowing or working with vets, and you've obviously spent at least a decade being around people and seeing/hearing how they think about vets - didn't you ever see that before?   Anyone who becomes a vet expecting prestige or money has made a mistake, and it's unfortunate that anyone goes into the profession with those ideas (it's one of the first things I tell people about the profession, along with the reality that vets spend most of their time with people, not animals).   I'm sorry if you've made that mistake.  

Taking paperwork (or computer work) home is NOT common for most practitioners - and in some places isn't even allowed.  The only vets I know who do that occasionally are owners, and they don't get it done at work because they also have management stuff to do.  There certainly are practitioners that have to do that, but that's specific to that clinic and it's not common.  Are students used as free labour?  Of course - just like in most other professional schools, but that's 4 years compared with a career of 25-40 years.  

You've got weird expectations about what privileges a ""professional degree"" should get you......Of course doctors (like many other professionals) work weekends in some jobs - that's because illness and injury doesn't care whether it's a weekday or weekend.  What did you expect?  Not all jobs in veterinary medicine involve clinic work, and not all clinics are open weekends, but those that aren't open weekends are able to do that because of the availability of doctors who DO work weekends in after-hours and ER clinics in many locations.  They have professional degrees too, and I am thankful that they're not too proud of their ""professional degree"" to work weekends.  

I'm sorry you're dissatisfied with your career choice, but I think it's a good profession that has both good and bad jobs (just like any profession).  I think a lot of your dissatisfaction is personal (based on your preconceived notions and unrealistic expectations), and not broadly about vet school (which sucked) or veterinary medicine as a profession.  I expected vet school to suck, and it did, but I am so much happier being a vet.Canada.  Midline.I'm sorry for the loss of your patient.  GDVs are critical and sometimes don't make it even with the best of intentions.Then there's nothing that could have been done, regardless.I do what I think is right for me to do, so I can sleep at night.  It may or may not be the right thing for another vet to do.I'm arriving mid-day Friday, and leaving Wednesday morning.  I'm going mostly for the better weather than I have at home, and I'll take in a few lectures while I'm there.I stopped letting that stuff bother me 20 years ago, and I also learned that sometimes OTC stuff is fine, and sometimes prescription stuff is the same stuff with a different label.  Other times, it's not.  And studies have their own share of biases and limits, so I am willing to consider other options and keep my mind open.   Sometimes, what we do doesn't help, and the patient gets better anyway.  Sometimes what the client wants to do doesn't help, and the patient gets better anyway. 

This is where medicine is as much art as science.  

If owners want to hold off on my recommendations and try something else, I tell them I don't recommend it, but it's their choice - but please give us an update so we know how Riggs is doing.  Then we put in a reminder to call them for an update in days or weeks (depending on what the issue is).    ""I make recommendations, but you make choices"" is my oft-repeated mantra.   The only things that will make me virtually beg owners to accept is analgesia and rabies vaccines.  

Why not go with low dose pred instead of Apoquel if the dog is that miserable?  Cytopoint can work miracles too.  I respect people who tell me something is too expensive for them, because then I know the reason and can work out plan B and C, to get them the most bang for their buck.Is it fair?  I don't know.

Is it smart?  No, I don't think so - I think it will anger more clients than it's worth, and it takes virtually no time or resources.  The doctor's reason is baloney - any certificate can be altered, even one you hand to them in person.  

FWIW, our clinic reissues vaccine certificates all the time without charge, though they are printed and signed by the vet before being handed (or scanned and emailed) to the client.crossing the border is the biggest one we see, and have seen problems with.It depends on the clinic, but in my experience most people hired to be CSR are neither prevented nor encouraged to move into assistant roles........That means a CSR would have to actively pursue it if that's what they want.>in “traditional” practice

Let's start with this being a small animal clinic - things can be very different in situations where one is dealing with assets and not pets.  

In virtually every small animal clinic, pets will only be euthanized for a medical problem (physical or mental) that can't be managed (for practical or financial reasons).  Those animals are not well, and they are typically sedated before they are euthanized.   I've very, very rarely heard any vocalizations, and special pains are taken to make the patient comfortable and pain free.

Additionally, I don't know if the drugs used are different in the different situation.No suits.  Smart casual is the best way to fit with most small animal clinics.If you find someone with a crystal ball who can tell the future, I have a few questions too......Have you discussed your concerns with 

>New management ?

If so, and they are not interested in feedback or changes, then leave now.  New management is running things the way they want to run them, apparently, and you owe them nothing but to do a good job.  

If this was a situation of previous management who's hit a tough spot, I can see reason to hang on and help them through it, back to the way things were, but.....Since this is new management who want to run things a new way, you should feel free to leave if you don't like the way they run things.Vetgirl on the RunI've only ever seen autoligation used in cat neuters, but I'm sure some vets somewhere are doing it.

Remember, there's no such thing as a routine surgery, even spays and neuters, so 1 technique does not fit all.  Especially when it comes to things like ""big"" or ""small"" dogs -- what's important is the size of their reproductive organs, not the size of the patient, and they don't always work in tandem.

Midline incision for cat and dog spays, pre-scrotal for dog neuters, scrotal for cat neuters.  Monocryl for all sutures, unless there's a lot of fat, then I use a braided for those ligations.  Modified miller's knots for spays and dog neuters (1 or 2), and subcuticular closures.  Usually put a ligature on the tunic on older or larger dogs, as it can get quite muscular and bleed a bit.  Occasionally transfix spays, depending on the size.Everything is negotiable, and there is no ""normal"" - some pay the same percentage on everything that isn't included, some pay different percentages on different things.  Make sure you know the details before deciding if you want to do that or not.  It's complicated.

I think it's a horrible way to pay vets, but certainly, under no circumstances, accept a negative accrual if you do go that way.1. Approximate compensation
2. Staff ration and skill levels (licensed tech vs. assistant)
3. Expected shifts (hours and days)

Equity?  Do you mean an increasing buy in, or shares in the corporation?Quality matters more than the number.  Last week we had a 3:2 ratio for a few days, but we did OK, because they were 3 talented RVTs.  A ratio of 4:1 sounds good, but only if they're talented and efficient.I find 30 minute appointments too long, but 15 minutes too short - for me 20 minutes is the sweet spot.Having a silent minority stake in the company would be of no interest to me.Probably Continuing Professional Development.It depends on where you are, and the local (state) regulations.Don't worry about it - production shouldn't be a concern when you're learning about a new job, and a new situation (i.e. clinic rather than school).  

It's one of the 643 reasons you shouldn't be paid on any production-based system in your first job out of school.>my employer negotiated a salary

&#x200B;

>I want to know how much of a windfall my employer has made

You also negotiated that salary.  Don't pretend that your employer is the only person to blame for a salary you don't like.  And don't forget that your employer almost assuredly spent more than that salary on you - they spent a lot of additional time with a new grad.

New grads should be thinking about so many other things than money, everything from medical cases to surgical techniques to client communication.  The learning curve is steep getting out of school, and there's no need or benefit to making it a steeper curve.   Additionally, new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.  What's more, they shouldn't have to - they should be spending their time and brain power on learning to be a better clinician.  

I'm against production-based pay in general, but I'm particularly against it for new grads, for at least the first 6-12 months.>I'm sorry if you can't comprehend that a person can simultaneously focus on improving at their job while also calculating how much their effort is worth to their employer.

I can comprehend it, but I think it's wrong and wrongheaded.  I know vets that do it, and I think they're spending their time and mental energy on the wrong things at that stage of their career.  

Of course you should fight for a fair salary, and I think it's not wrong to know how much gross income you earned the clinic in your first year *in order to assess how your year went* (your boss will do the same), but assessing your contributions for the  year is different than worrying about production ahead of time, or (worse) while you're working.I agree that it seems odd that it developed so far from surgery, and it makes me wonder about the dog's healing or clotting.  Or if there was other trauma.

Personally, I don't think a hematoma that long after surgery is related to your surgical techniques.  I've done a lot of neuters in young adult dogs with only minor post-op hematomas, so I don't think this is about you at all.You're far from starting late - there are more than a few who graduate when they're close to 40 or 50.  I graduated over 20 years ago, when I was 38, and I was not the oldest in my vet school class.  However, managing the debt when you're older is a different issue.You need to know if you want to actually work as a vet, not just what you think working as a vet will be like.  Now is a good time to start spending time with vets on their jobs, to see what it is they really do.  Get a job or ask to volunteer with a vet or two (or three, not at the same time) who do different things, or work in different places.  Make sure it's what you want to do before investing your time and money in going to vet school.There are no shortage of job opportunities for veterinary assistants, so maybe you should consider finding a different clinic to work for........different workplaces really offer different experiences.You must be looking to apply outside of Canada.  If you went to your regional school, the cost will be less than a quarter of that amount.  

Why aren't you considering applying in Canada?If you're going to go to a vet school that is not accredited by the AVMA, then be prepared to spend about $10,000 and 2-4 years in order to pass all the various tests required to get your license back in Canada.The OP didn't even mention if they tried.  Some people just want to go away to school and don't think about the savings of going locally.What I see more often is people deciding ""I'll never get in"" and so don't even bother, or don't bother trying to take steps to improve their application.They accept US students, but not other Canadian studentsI'm an OVC grad from over 20 years ago......I have been really happy in my career and really like my job, but I never would have done it if it would have left me $200,000+ in debt.  Nothing is worth that kind of life-altering financial situation, in my opinion, and I know I'd have found something else to work in that I also really liked.Slow down and breathe - your brain needs oxygen to work properly

Remember to eat - your brain needs fuel to work properly> My question (beyond just venting here) is that if the contract doesn't specifically say they don't collect negative production balance, can they still collect it? 

That's why you need to talk to a lawyer.  The devil is in the details of the contract and of your state and federal laws.Once you graduate and pass the NAVLE, no future employer will care what grades you got.In my case, it wasn't a dislike for people, but a dislike for the system of human medical care.>Every website I visit seems to have the exact same things, which makes me worried for cheap quality knockoffs?

I don't know why......I just means that there aren't many manufacturers.  Look for companies that make or sell other veterinary or medical products, for instance a company that makes dental instruments will have dental-enhanced skulls (like these [https://im3vet.com/canine-skull-model-clear/](https://serona.ca/products/im3-canine-skull-model-clear?_pos=1&_sid=579c6d59a&_ss=r)) , or this company that's been making anatomical models for over 40 years, but only sells through other distributors ([https://gpianatomicals.com/category/veterinary-models/](https://gpianatomicals.com/category/veterinary-models/))  Common models (like a stifle) are available from standard veterinary product distributors, like Jorvet and Patterson.  You also might find some vets that are making customized models with 3D printers that you can contact and probably buy from.The first thing you should do is check the legal requirements for recording audio and video in your state, and make sure that the legal requirements are being fulfilled (are there notices to inform clients, if that's required?).

There are valid safety and security concerns to having cameras (with or without audio) in a vet clinic - not just where money and drugs are being handled, but also in the exam room where clients might do something illegal (whether it's assault, threaten, or try to blackmail you).

That being said, I would not tolerate someone using that video to critique my performance or micro-manage my cases.  If a boss was going to use recordings for that purpose, I'd be finding a new job with a boss who has a different attitude about practice and privacy.It's not really being recorded for training purposes......that's just what they say so that they don't have to say ""This call is being recorded so that we will have proof if you verbally abuse our employees"".Why are you looking for a post-grad program?  What do you want to achieve?

Oh, and where in the world to you live?I don't recommend it right out of school........I did a little of that right out of school, and it was a mistake that I regret and don't recommend.  You need a little time getting used to (and examining) variations of normal before you jump right in to nothing but illnesses and problems, IMO.Cornerstone does allow for EMR (electronic medical records), but IMO it's not a very good or easy to use software package - but it's there now, and there has to be a damned good reason for changing it, since changing it is very expensive and takes a lot of time.  Ask her why she/they are not using the EMR feature in Cornerstone.  

There's nothing magical about EMR vs. hand written records - the devil is in the details.  Some people may find one method faster than the other, depending on their familiarity with the software and their keyboarding speed.  Typed records will be more legible, but it's possible to have fast and legible hand written records.  A bad electronic record is no better than a bad hand written record, and being able to read to see how bad (lacking) it is won't make it any better.

There are ways to speed up hand written records, using template stickers or stamps.  She could type out her records and then print out the page to include in the file, if she types faster than she writes (provided she can think as fast as she can type, not everyone can).Being a practitioner is a lot easier than being a student (especially an intern or resident), but sometimes the obvious answers are the easiest:

Get a slow cooker.  Hot meals waiting for you when you get home, at any hour.

Exercise with work: Walk or bike to work if you can, take a walk on your lunch break, do little bits when you can (I do some morning stretches while brushing my teeth).Being a clinical vet (i.e. in a vet clinic or hospital) is more about working with people than with pets - this is probably the first thing people should realize before deciding if they want to pursue becoming a clinical vet.  (There are a variety of non-clinical jobs as a vet, but the vast majority of vet students become clinical vets, and that's what most people think of when they think about becoming ""a vet"").  

The second thing is that this is a medical degree and career, and you have to be interested in medicine, in not also science.  

The first thing you should do is get a job or volunteer position in a clinic to see what people do there, and if that's the kind of thing you want to pursue.There's a standard safety protocol for handling meds:  Look at the label when you pick it up, look again when it's in your hand, and look a third time when you put it back.   It's a way to triple check yourself about what medication you're handling/giving/dispensing, at three different times in the process.  Don't be afraid to ask someone to double check it for you  - that's standard in many clinics anyway, so it's nothing to feel badly or ashamed about.","Veterinarian.
   Explanation: The comment discusses veterinary medical procedures, including surgeries and anesthesia, and mentions",Veterinarian
MakunaHatata99,"This is unfair and wrong on so many levels. It can’t just be let go. Now they will try to get away with a email saying “We apologize for the inconvenience and the trouble…” and WORST part is they probably will get away without any consequences.Let’s say they rectify the issue. But how do you convince and want 1000s of candidates to have faith when you literally mixed up their scores. This is the only issue that came to light, and they want us to believe whatever goes on behind the scenes runs smoothly with zero mistakes. 
They literally take almost $1000 per candidate and promise to make a fair and smooth examination process but the reality is completely opposite. 
All they are competent in is imposing limit on retakes, messing up exam schedules & score releases, limited exam windows - when there is already a massive veterinarian shortage.They can’t carry on with all the mismanagement with zero accountability.At this point can just accept they f* up, and just provide a remedial measure.

Whatever scores I get I won’t believe it’s mine, because I no longer trust them.I strongly agree. Their whole objective is to set a standardized process for quality veterinary practice and facilitate a smooth examination to achieve the objective. We pay them money because we look up to them as a governing body with a standard.

And what has been happening is completely opposite, they have become an epitome of negligence and mistrust. 

We need to realize that we aren’t paying them money to get such a poor treatment. And we need to stand together, THIS IS NEGLIGENCE. We all have been wronged.💯 I mean the count of students and probably all the foreign graduates being affected would be in higher 1000s easily.Yes please do update us. Appreciate the initiative. Such negligence can’t be ignored.Nobody here is dragging them to the court. The scale at which it’s affecting everyone right now is obviously huge. And I believe it’s not just limited to NA graduates but veterinarians all around the globe. The magnitude of stakeholders is very significant. 
Everyone here is just trying to share their concerns and fears.

IntrepidOption2635,"I would be happy to answer questions along the way, I am from the US though so may not be as helpful with certain questions having to do with that.It is definitely possible, I know a decent amount of vets who started in other careers. In terms of getting in to vet school you will have to take the pre-req courses(chemistry, biochem, orgo, ect) but no specific degree is required so you just need to complete those courses. A full list can be found on most vet school websites. It is good you have volunteering experience with shelters but you may want to find a way to get more experience directly with veterinarians as well. In my experience schools seem to like applicants who are arebswitching carreers. It wouldn't hurt to reach out the admissions office of some schools you're interested in and just ask as well. Good luck, hope to see you in the field.Hello, I am a current 4th year vet student who shares your passion for surgery. It is a long journey. The bare minimum requirements to become a boarded surgeon are achieving your DVM, one year of a rotating internship after vet school graduation, and a 3-year residency. This is easier said than done, and it's not uncommon to have to do multiple internships (known as specialty internships, these would be one year programs that are surgery focused) before getting a residency. During your surgery residency you will be required to take two board exams, and you have to publish at least one paper in a veterinary journal. It's never too early to start gaining surgical experience. A good place to start would be a local shelter that does high volume spay/neuters; they're typically always looking for volunteers. If you have any additional questions I'd be happy to answer.Not a dumb question. As a rule of thumb it is not ideal. Usually 30-60k a year. It depends on where you go. Private internships and residencies pay more in general like 60-80k but academic is much lower, like 20-50k.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

glitchgorge,"So many awesome suggestions already! I got a Hip Tech Bag from this company when I started as a vet assistant and I literally can’t work without it. They’re similar to the ones on amazon, but they come in a bunch of really cute patterns so you could get her something more unique to her!

https://sipseywilder.com/collections/tech-hip-bagI have zero interest in going the RVT route, so The only way I can make it work is by having an equal partner to share expenses with and also doing a fairly lucrative side hustle—in my case, I photograph dog sports & make around 20-30k/yr doing that on top of my meager vet assistant wage (which is higher than minimum wage, but still low). I really lucked out and my clinic is FANTASTIC and supportive and is very flexible with the time off I need.. last year I also made around $2000 in quarterly bonuses we receive if the clinic hits their profit goals.

marruman,"According to [fair work](https://www.fairwork.gov.au/employment-conditions/public-holidays), your boss can either pay you public holiday rates, or give you another day off in lieu.

I don't see why this wouldn't apply to your on call hours also. You could reach out to the AVA for more info, they are meant to offer that sort of advice (if you're a member)?A few of the Australian unis also offer the course as an undergrad degree. Massey uni is the only vet school in NZ, generally most of the schools require a written application +/- an interview, but no prereq. Obviously having a high level of practical experience improves your odds. Unsure what percentage of places are offered to international students at Massey though. It's likely to be pretty competitiveThat's a really good way to put it. I like my boss fine, but not enough to want to marry her/enter into a longterm financial relationship with her.

My partner was mostly responding to my frustration about my current role. I enjoy it, but the clinic is too small to allow me to work full time, so currently I'm not bringing in as much money as I'd like. My partner mostly mentionned partnering as an option to increase my earnings but... yeah. It's not really something I want. I do appreciate getting input from others though, that way I feel more confident shooting it down if it comes up again lol.We have a steady caseload but the clinic only has one consult room, so we only have one vet on at a time. I know the boss wants to expand to a larger facility, but is having trouble finding somewhere appropriate. My fiancé was thinking that if we provide some of the capital to facilitate that, then it would benefit me because then the move may be able to happen sooner and then I could be working more days a week.

I do believe our case load would support a second full time vet, if we had a second consult room.I'm in a small town with a vet school, so it's probably one of the only places in the country not in the midst of a vet shortage -.- but my partner needs to stay here for his career so we're not in anposition to move atmYeah, the more I think about it, the more I don't think this would be right for me, tbhAnother thing I've not seen mentionned is Vets without Borders can allow you to travel. I think they'll generally offer accommodation but you won't get paid during your stay.My old boss has done a few stints of volunteering overseas as an Australian citizen living in Australia, and I thought it was with Vets beyond Borders, but maybe it was a different organisation, idkMy dude, you'll always have some clients come in, complain about their animal's issues, refuse every single option you present them, and then complain that seeing you was a waste of money because you didn't magically fix the problem for free. That's just how it be sometimes.

For lame dogs, I tend to have the pain relief discussion less in terms of pain (""he's not painful, he's just lame"" owners will sometimes say) and more in terms of the anti-inflammatory effect. I'll generally say something along the lines of ""I suspect we're dealing with a soft tissue injury, like a sprain or a strain. We should start a course of anti-inflammatories, which will help settle any swelling, and help him recover faster. He will still need to be rested while he's on the medication to avoid making the injury worse. It's also useful to use the medication, because if he doesn't improve, that could indicate a more serious injury, like a cruciate tear, and we may need to do an x-ray"".

Like this, I've presented my opinion without making it seem optional, I've explained why the medication is useful beyond pure pain relief (because a shocking amount of owners won't care about that aspect), and I've also floated the idea of it being a diagnostic tool- in that non-improvement would indicate a need to look further.

Unfortunately, some people are just going to be assholes about it. Just make sure you document as thoroughly as possible in those cases.I saw a dog while shadowing in vet school that was being treated for lipeamia (or maybe hypertriglygereamia?) And was meant to be on a low fat diet. I did the initial history taking- O reports she's feeding the new diet as instructed. The new diet is home cooked I think, so she goes into a lot of detail, but overall it all seems appropriate. The vet is frustrated and confused because the bloods aren't improving. She goes out back to do something, leaving me in the room with the client. We're chatting, and, like 40 mins into the appointment, she mentions his ""protein balls"", which she uses to tablet him and are NOT part of the diet. 

Turns out she'd been feeding him like 2-3 balls of pure peanut butter a day. I got to feel pretty good about cracking that particular case lolDoes it pay well? No. Does it pay enough? Yes. Would I want to do anything else? Not really. 

I've had trouble finding work in my town and have neither the desire nor the capital to open my own clinic, so I've gone down to part time work, and working other jobs has really made me appreciate how much I love what I do. 

That said, vet school was harrowing enough for me that if I had to do it over, I probably wouldn't.I'm in Australia, I work 2 days a week (14 hours), and get 42/hr, or ~500 per week, 6 years out.

When I was working full-time, I was making about 1300/week after tax.

This is all in AUD, btwYou've said you're in the US, so most likely you will need some serious clinical hours to get considered for a DVM, from what I've heard. 

I went to vet school straight out of high school (in Australia). Probably the no 1 advice I would have had for prospective vet students would be to do a year working as a vet nurse first. It will give you a bit of a leg up on some of the coursework, and it will give you a chance to assess if this is something you actually want. 

Personally, I'm very happy where I am. I enjoy the work, euthanasia animals has never been an issue for me. Vet school was very rough though.The last 3 years of my 5 year course felt like an emotional meat grinder. You'd be in lectures from 8-5 all week, then you'd need to somehow try to allocate an hour of study for each hour of coursework, which was impossible. I basically had no free time because I was studying, and if I wasn't studying (because I needed a break, for a doctor's appointment, because I had a social commitment), I'd spend the whole time feeling guilty for not studying. It is the hardest I've ever worked, and, most of the time, it was not enough and I had to sit supplementary exams. A couple of the lecturers could be pretty unsympathetic (or, at least, I was in such a state of stress that it felt unsympathetic). One of them, in our clinical year, would just yell at you while you were anaesthetising an animal (I guess to teach you how to work under pressure?). All of this was compounded by the financial stress of being a student with no secure source of income. We didn't even really get a break between semesters, because we had to do 25 weeks of placement in those 5 years.You might avoid major injuries working as a home visit vet or euthanasia only vet, but you'll have to get through training first. It seems highly unlikely to me that you could make it through vet school without getting exposure to serious wounds. You will also be doing a lot of cadaver work, as well as surgery practice on live animals (in the final years).

Tolerance to gore is something that can be worked on. Many people start out squeamish and get over it over time. 

I'd generally recommend that if you're seriously considering vet school, it's probably worth looking at working in a vet clinic as a nurse/assistant/kennel hand for some period of time to get an idea of what you might be dealing with.I don't think this is unreasonable- it sounds like this isn't working for you, and while it might improve over time, it isn't working now. It might be worth framing some of it as a personal preference, like:

""Hey MD, I understand and appreciate your plan to have a tech shadowing every vet. I think this would be a really great end goal, however I feel like the transition is being a bit rocky since we have so few staff. I was wondering if, at least for now, it would be OK if I opted out of having a shadowing tech until we get some more staff on board. I'm used to writing my own notes, and would prefer to write them myself. This would free up an extra tech to help out at back, and hopefully will help smooth the transition a bit until we can get some extra techs onboard.""

Try to phrase it less as ""your plan is unreasonable due to our staffing issues and moreso as ""I'm on board but am aware of our issues and I'm doing my part to try and lessen the load"". Hopefully, it'll at least buy you some goodwill.

I personally really don't like having nurses writing my notes for me, and it is very much not the standard where I live, so I'd probably opt out of this as much as I could anyway.I'd never even heard of autoligation on an ovary... certainly not something I'd risk. I like a circumferential, but if it's a big dog or a very fat pedicle, I'll throw a Miller's knot. I generally doubly ligate all ovarian pedicles, just to be safe. For a cat castrate, I'll autoligate with no sutures. A dog castrate I'll do the same regardless of the size of the dog, but for adult large dogs we may discuss doing a scrotal ablation. 
I use PDS for all internal sutures, and generally place intradermals rather than skin sutures (though if I'm not happy with how the intradermals sit, I might throw on some horizontal mattress sutures over the incision.Agreed on the male cats- it's so quick and efficient! Tbh I don't even know how I would go about autoligating an ovary, I'm having a lot of trouble even picturing it. What are you even using to ligate here? The uterine horn? How do you go about removing the uterus afterwards?Interesting! I see I've been using the term autoligation wrong in regards to the testicle- what most vets here do is they use the testicular blood vessel and the vast deferens to tie a knot. I think I've seen the technique you're describing once, so I can kinda visualise what you're describing, but it is very foreign to me.In Australia, it's a requirement for all staff involved in taking x-rays have dosimeter badges. Is this the case where you are? You might want to consider buying one for yourself for peace of mind, but be aware it typically needs to be tested every 3 months to monitor whether you are staying in the safe zone","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

MN1314,"My issue is that I love vet med but I cannot get into vet school. I discovered my passion for vet med after graduating undergrad and I hate it for me. I love this profession so much that I worked as a vet assistant starting at $12.50 an hour full time while completing every pre-requisite I needed to apply. My grades weren’t stellar, but they were good enough to apply. I gathered SO many experiences the past four years, small GP and emergency, large, and exotic. My recommendations were great. But I was denied two cycles in a row. The applicants basically doubled from last year. File reviews tell me basically I’m “good but not good enough” and want me to get a masters degree that I don’t have five figures to dish out for right now. I’m 28 years old, I’ve gone into more debt for this profession, poured my heart and soul into this profession, moved up in my clinic to a lead surgery assistant, but I have absolutely nothing to show for it: no savings account, I’m single, barely able to afford rent, and all of my friends are advancing in their careers, starting families and own houses. I just have a pile of rejections. I’ve decided it may be time for me to move on from this profession that I love and use my bachelor’s degree that will make me 4x more money than I make now. It pains me to see vets go through bad experiences and leave the profession, I would give anything to be given a chance. I can’t imagine doing anything else with my life but I truly don’t think I can last another application cycle 😩

HiddenJindo,"Hello! Veterinary medicine is an incredibly rewarding career but, in most cases, clinical medicine is quite busy. A successful, well-functioning clinic is typically a busy clinic. It is good that you have had clinical experience already! There are options for lowering your workload but it depends on where you're working, the type of work you're doing, and how much control you have over your schedule.

As far as the US Army HPSP scholarship, financially it is a great deal. The scholarship pays for 3 years of veterinary school. At the same time, you are paid a monthly stipend of \~$2000 per month (greatly varying by your location). In exchange you owe 4 years active duty to the US Army.

An army veterinarian is a unique job. The primary clinical focus of the army veterinarian is to support the health of the military working dog (MWD). The typical army veterinarian performs less clinics than a civilian veterinarian because they will also spend their time doing other tasks such as auditing food facilities (ice cream facilities, bottled water plants, etc) that sell to the military. The history of army veterinarians performing food protection dates back to a time where the Army shipped cadavers (e.g. cattle) by rail as a primary food source for soldiers, and veterinarians were able to judge if animal meat was still consumable or not after transport. Army veterinarians also deploy and provide humanitarian relief.

Depending on where you are assigned in the army, you may do a mix of medicine and food work, or all food work, or all army work. It is a very real possibility that an army veterinarian attached to a deployable unit does not touch an animal patient for 2-3 years.

This fact is a big negative to many army veterinarians who originally became veterinarians because they wanted to work on animals, haha. 

At the end of the day, I think becoming an Army veterinarian for the financial benefits is still worth it because of the incredible cost of veterinary school. But it's important to understand the cost of becoming one, and the resulting time you may lose to 'develop' yourself as a clinician. It's also helpful if you have a personal desire to serve in the military, and not just because you're motivated by the financial benefits.

Justgivemeanamethen,"Everyone here is right about this being toxic behavior. You need to have a conversation with management about it. 

I’ve worked with a lot of assistants and doctors (as an assistant and manager) in my time in clinics. My experience with this behavior has been this:

1) some assistants/techs are lazy and don’t want to do extra work. So when they say things like “no one else makes us do this” that sounds like lazy staff to me. They may like the other doc because she is happy to take short cuts and “create less work” for them. 

2) how do you act when you are stressed or overwhelmed? I’ve worked with vets who shut down, can’t make a decision, and get snappy when they feel stressed. Those types of reactions can cause the team to question competency. How do you respond when they offer suggestions when you’re stressed? I would get frustrated with vets who are clearly overwhelmed but unwilling to accept my input. (ex. recommending a vet stage other extractions when they are already behind, can’t get good dental rads and there’s a root they can’t get out. only for them to tell me they already got approval from the owner so they have to do it.) 

3) I’d much prefer a doctor do additional work ups than just take the easy way out. I can much easier defend good medicine that irks a client than bad medicine that causes problems for a patient. I think any good tech/assistant would say the same. I do get frustrated when the doctor can’t multi task through it. Are you able to delegate the treatment plan to them and move on to the next patient or are you involved in every step? I’d have some vets that want to draw the blood and start the tests when it would be faster for me to do it. You really need to have trust in them to do that. 

I have also seen staff members who love working with bad vets! Idk why! The one I’m thinking of specifically gossiped with the staff, used the R word several times (and didn’t understand why she couldn’t continue to use it after I coached her) and never bothered to read medical histories. I saw her do the dumbest things that came back with complications and they still liked her. All that to say sometimes the staff aren’t as smart as they think they are.

They should improve the network and make in viable for both customers and node runner before getting their big paydaySo why introduce the 30+% settlement fee before ironing out anything?Do you know in general most of the mining pools (BTC, ETH) are taking only 1%-1.5% pool fee?The payout that I just got

Fee = 0.8466977 MYST (94%)  
Actual payout to the balance = 0.05564006 MYST (6%)

Anyone can tell me what costs do they need to cover to take 94% dev fee?My point is - there are tons of small PoW pool operators who don't get millions from the 1-1.5% fee. If they want to grow the network (in this case, their mining pool), they have to be competitive. Taking every single penny you could right now will just drives people away.No, Sunflower Farmer has been shut down yesterday. The fee on Polygon is back to normal today. My payout transaction is indeed 30 gwei, which actually used only 0.00315708 MATIC. And they took 0.8466977 MYST for the fee.

Everything is on Polygonscan, they can't lie about it.Everything is on the blockchain. They cannot lie about the fee.

In my payout transaction, the gas price is 30 gwei and it used 0.00315708 MATIC. Ends up they charged me 0.8466977 MYST on the settlement fee.Yes, the transaction paid 30 gwei gas price (actually spent 0.00315708 MATIC), but charged me 0.66623014429488 MYST (which is about 0.1344 MATIC). The 42x fee is sent to the dev wallet for the so-called ""Polygon mainnet fee"". 

The transaction is on the blockchain, everyone can verify whether I am telling the truth.The answer is Yes and No.

They didn't miscalculate the gas fee when they actually need to pay to send the transaction. They correctly set the gas fee as 30 gwei and spent 0.00315708 MATIC.

It is when they charged me for the said gas fee, they miscalculated and deducted 42 times more (0.8466977 MYST, which is around 0.1344 MATIC) and send it to the dev wallet.No, the Sunflower Farmer game has been shut down yesterday. The Polygon fee is already back to normal today.

In my payout transaction, the actual gas price used is the minimum (30 gwei), and it used  0.00315708 MATIC, but ends up they charged me a total of 0.8466977 MYST fee.

Everything is on Polygonscan, they can't lie about it.So, here are your estimations:

\- Estimated transaction fee (when you charge the node operator) is 0.66623014429488 MYST, which is about 0.1344 MATIC

\- At the same time, when you send the transaction to the Polygon mempool, you estimated that you only need to set 30 gwei (which is 0.00315708 MATIC)

Please explain to me why your estimated fee to charge the node operator is 42 times higher than the estimated fee that you actually used to send the transaction to the mempool? Both the estimations happened at the same time. You know your only need gas price 30 gwei, but you still charge 42x of the fee anyway.As expected, the dev on discord initially blames it on the gas fee on Polygon, and said there is a sudden raise that ""went 3000 Gwei before 15-25min i think"".

I am well aware of the Sunflower Farm situation, I know Sunflower Farm has shutdown yesterday already, and the gas fee is back to normal today.

The evidence is that the transaction that sent me the payout is indeed using 30 gwei (actual used 0.00315708 MATIC). I am still waiting for them to explain how a 0.00315708 MATIC fee became 0.8466977 MYST.The problem is not ""withdrawal"", it was the ""settlement"", which the dev just estimate a ridiculous gas price and charge you for that, while when actually send the transaction they only pay the minimum 30 gwei.The team wallet did take 42 times more of the fee. The transaction is on the blockchain and everyone can verify that.

0.66623014429488 MYST (which is about 0.1344 MATIC) is taken by the team wallet as the gas fee, while at the same time, you only spent 30 gwei (0.00315708 MATIC) to send the transaction.

If this is not ""take additional money"", please tell me what it is?It went to 3000 gwei for a minute, but when you settle my transaction, you already know you only need to pay 30 gwei (because this is the gas price you set when you send it to the Polygon mempool), but you still charged 42 times of the fee that you actually spend.

I won't complain if you indeed set 3000 gwei for the transaction and charge me for that. But you only set 30 gwei and charged me 42x.It happened to me once, but others on discord have also reported similar issues. The explanation that they gave does not stand its ground. When they guess how much they need to charge me (the node operator) for the transaction gas fee, their ""estimation"" was 0.1344 MATIC. However, at the very same time, when they actually sent the transaction to the mempool, they made another ""estimation"" and correctly set 30 gwei only as gas price (actual spent 0.00315708 MATIC).

As of today, they STILL DID NOT explain why the ""guess"" at the exact same time is different by 42 times.

If they are what they claimed ""that team won't take additional money from you"", they should refund the overestimated gas fee to the node operators. All those settlement transactions are on the blockchain, it can be verified by everyone. They can easily see how much they charged the node operator versus how much they actually spent on the gas fee.

Will they do it?Not at all. No one is actually using the network.

Just ask all those people who have set up a node, you barely have one or two connections a day. Average node earn about 1 MYST ($0.5) a month, and when you got the payout (0.3 MYST) nearly half are taken as ""fee"". So, net earning are usually 0.5 MYST per month.

That probably tell you how ""popular"" this project is.Not at all. No one is actually using the network.

washgirl7980,"I'm making $23 an hour as a VA in Seattle. I can only afford to make so little because my husband is a machinist and makes 3x what I make. I started the Penn Foster route when I entered the field 3 years ago, but I am about ready to just give up on being an LVT entirely. Working full time and raising 2 teens and taking an online program with no book has so far been too much.  I love my job, but if my partner wasn't making so much, I'd probably not be so content. I feel bad for my younger coworkers who are single and actually existing off these wages. I'm sorry, I don't know how you do it.☹️EXACTLY.

You literally need to take notes of everything, because anything could end up on a quiz or test. It just became too much. 

I had originally planned to take the in person route for school, but my first boss in the field convinced me to enroll at Penn Foster so I could still work full time. Big mistake.Can you work and go to school? Try and get a job at an animal hospital. I started as a receptionist with zero experience in the vet field. As far as volunteering goes, look for animal foundations that provide free appointments and surgeries. Whenever the non-profit from my hospitals has a clinic we get lots of volunteers from outside the vet world. It would give you the opportunity to see how things are done AND to meet people and other techs in the industry.We don't really have staff for more than 4 or 5 procedures a day, and where as other doctors will take drop off in-between, they do everything they can to not. The vet in  question was apparently hired by the owner to only do surgeries, but if so, no one told our office manager. It's been quite uncomfortable being in the middle trying to support a doctor and a boss who do not meet eye to eye(to say the least). I am lucky I have no

ImpressiveInterest9,"I'm from the US and I was also a first generation student. You can PM if you ever wanna talk!If you're going to be a doctor. You will lose patients. Some will be your fault. Others will just be a mystery. They all hurt. They all stay with you. You will always feel a type of guilt and think of the what ifs. 

But my professor and mentor told us, you know who doesn't have patients die in surgery, those that don't do surgery. They also told us that with every mistake we make, make sure you learn something from it. Analyze it and learn something.It is definitely easy to see all the mistakes we do and not see the good we've done.I felt the same in clinical practice and I went into shelter medicine and it was a breath of fresh air. I love shelter medicine. I love being a vet now.I'm a Rossie and went to a different clinical school and can tell you it was the same. I became bitter at one point, it really affected my mental and spirit. I always tried to go in with a positive attitude and was told by a clinician, ""well it appears your parents smiled at you too much when you were a kid, why do you smile so much?"" He said that in front of everyone multiple times to me. It's like they want to break your spirits, they find joy breaking your spirit. 

I had one clinican make me feel like I was so incompetent, when in reality it was cause I was taking all the ECC onco cases cause my rotation mates were 4th years and would not take cases just simple appointments. 

It took me one rotation away from the university to remember my passion and restore my spirit. When I cam back to clinics I was so annoyed. I did not want to be there. Everyone just seemed so bitter. 

Vet med academia is toxic. One of the reasons I didn't even think about residency, who wants to be in that misery for 4 years with shitty pay.Honestly reading through all these experiences just brought me back to clinical year and made me sad.

MooCowMoooo,"Have you considered in-home euthanasia? People who work for Lap of Love always seem very happy and fulfilled. I looked into it once and always have it in the back of my mind to do if I burn out again.Relief is also the reason I’m finally happy with the career. If you asked me in my first 5 years if it was worth it, I would have said absolutely not. Relief work allows you freedom to avoid the many clinics that will work you to death. It pays well, you don’t have to deal with the usual clinic drama, and people are grateful that you are there helping.

Unfortunately, you probably need to do some regular GP for a couple of years before you do relief, to get experience and feel comfortable as a solo practitioner.I have heard polarizing opinions.

On one hand, people say they love it. They get paid very well. The fact that clients see everything seems to be a benefit as they can see pets being triaged and better understand why they have to wait.

On the other hand, I’ve heard that the culture is ridiculous and the vet is expected to take every phone call because clients are told they can always reach a doctor. Even if that means taking a phone call to talk about flea control while scrubbed into surgery. 

I’m intrigued by them, but I don’t think I could do my job with clients watching my every move. And I get a lot of cult vibes from them. The people who love it seem so devoted and seem to have nothing bad to say. And the matching t shirts at the conferences. If a documentary came out in 10 years about it being a cult, I wouldn’t be shocked 😂Do you feel you have enough experience to work alone? If so, I recommend trying relief work for a while. I found it less stressful and you can get a good feel for a lot of different clinics in the area. I found my current job by starting as relief there. If you want a base salary and benefits, look into VetIQ.If you’re not on medication, consider talking to a doctor. Zoloft made such a huge difference in my overall outlook and confidence levels. I finally experienced what it’s like to not imagine the worst case scenario and second guess every decision I made at work.Switching to relief saved my career. It’s good money, keeps things fresh and interesting, everyone is appreciative of you, and the daily staff drama doesn’t grind you down.

I have a friend who does relief through VetIQ which seems like a good option if you need benefits. I haven’t tried them, but they seem very flexible (you can work anywhere from once to 5 times a week, and can choose to knock all your days out at the beginning of the month, then take the rest of the month off). They pay a base salary, even if they don’t have a shift for you, and they offer health insurance, CE, and other benefits.You just have to stop caring. It sucks for the pet, but you’ll drive yourself insane if you try to convince these people. They’ve already made up their minds.

Self-Taught-Pillock,"It depends on the practice and also the area. I didn’t work in veterinary medicine too long, but the practice that employed me made it a condition of my employment that my tattoos (pet-related tattoos) were covered while on site. It’s important to note that while such a requirement seems stuffy and of outdated sentiments, they didn’t have a moment’s hesitation hiring me or anyone with tattoos. They only wanted them covered. At the very most, I believe that’s what you’re facing: merely covering tattoos instead of not being hired because of them.

Most practices don’t care. I had tattooed acquaintances at other practices in this rather religious and conservative area that didn’t have to cover, even one with a septum piercing that wasn’t required to hide it. And long after I left veterinary medicine, I had to take my own little baby dog to a specialist clinic for a hemilaminectomy, and the specialist clinic (that had about 50-60% Mormon clientele) had plenty of tattooed employees that weren’t required to cover while at work.

Lyx4088,"Are you rabies vaccinated? If they are and you aren’t, that could be playing into some it with it being shelter medicine. It’s also possible they’ve observed your restraint technique and they’re not comfortable with it. Some people are overly aggressive in their restraint thinking it is necessary and most effective when that isn’t the case necessarily. It’s something worth asking them. A nice “hey I know we’re really short staffed. Is there a reason my help is being refused?” It could even be something like they just expect you to just jump in and help, not ask to help. I’d observe some too to see if you can get a better idea based on patterns of behavior if there is an underlying reason why if you don’t want to ask at this point.Some of the stuff alleged there is going to apply regardless of who the employer is or who they’re affiliated with. Going after employers for labor law violations and retaliation, sexual harassments, and staff not being licensed/certified/qualified for what they’re doing under applicable state law is smart. Anyone who has worked in vet med for a while has likely seen violations on these fronts, whether they recognize it or not. Know your state’s labor laws and absolutely report employers violating them. The reality is toxic behavior does not necessarily rise to the threshold of illegal behavior, but it is important to know when it does to hold individual’s accountable since institutions rarely will until an outside regulating body or entity is considering levying fines and legal action against them. When the toxicity is coming from the top down, your only hope is going to be multiple people catching them engaging in illegal employment and professional conduct, and bringing it to the attention of appropriate agencies with evidence (which make sure that is documented in a legal way for your state) to have them go after the problem individuals or even institution.Veterinary behaviorists are in a terrifying state, even with the number working in private practice.There just aren’t enough. I think there are around 80ish boarded veterinary behaviorists globally, and education surrounding behavior in vet school can be lacking from the lack of available expertise. It’s a very small field, and it’s a huge problem. Especially when you’re talking about dogs and cats who may not be receiving the support and treatment they need because there is not access to a boarded behaviorist, or if there is one they’re so inundated they’re helping at such a late stage with potentially catastrophic consequences for the animal.It’s worth noting California is a state that treats PTO as earned wages. You might see unlimited PTO in California more often as a way to get around paying out a ton of days of PTO when someone leaves a company. So it is worth being skeptical of an employer offering it and if that PTO is meaningfully accessible or if the employer is doing it to save money related to staffing turnover.I’m also wondering what the cost of euthanasia may be at that practice, and if it has radically changed since clients may have last needed to say goodbye to an animal? I ask that because I do wonder if they’re looking to take care of it first, clients then balk at the pricing that is much more than they were expecting based on previous experience, and then they’re being told well if they don’t pay the euth isn’t happening. I’ve worked at practices where prior to scheduling a euth, pricing for services were discussed so people could be prepared coming in and know what they’d like to do. That doesn’t help in a situation where an owner comes in not expecting to have the appointment end in euthanasia though. 

In my own personal experience, there are some serious issues these days with how some practices are being run (corporate vet med is horrifying). Last April I had to say goodbye to my 16 year old little lady. When we’ve previously had to call to set up a euth at that practice, they had been a practice that went over pricing for services on the phone with us so we were prepared. This time, everything was so abrupt it didn’t even register they didn’t. This practice was corporate bought out and has undergone serious changes over the last 5 years. We just had her euthanized. We brought her body home and buried her on our property (legal where I am). She was 12 lbs. It was over $300 for the euthanasia. Strictly euthanasia. Just a catheter and the drugs. No appointment cost because we’d just come in the day before looking to say goodbye, the vet convinced us to try one more med to give us a bit more time, and then the next morning it was clear the medication was going to do nothing to buy her more time. I’m all for paying staff and keeping the practice doors open, but after we said goodbye and got in the car, I turned and asked my wife “we had the money to do this and say goodbye humanely. What are people who don’t have the money doing? Over $300 for a 12 lbs dog is not insignificant and plenty of people wouldn’t be able to afford that.” Approximately 5 years prior a euthanasia at that practice for an 80 lbs lab was $150 with cremation being an additional cost. 

If clients at OP’s practice are experiencing a similar level of sticker shock, I get them being exceptionally upset. But if CSRs are following up with we won’t perform euthanasia until you pay, that is a problem. There are absolutely more compassionate ways to handle that and a policy like that would drive me from the practice as an employee. Even working emergency in a role where I was building estimates and presenting them to clients, we’d never approach it like that when there were serious financial concerns with a life threatening condition. I can’t wrap my mind around telling people you need to pay now or we’re not euthanizing as essentially an opening line. That is just wild and such a bad management policy.","Other.

Tantei_Metal,"Not a vet student but my wife is a 4th year and she’s graduating this May. She had 4 contracts sent to her, and 4 more places wanting to hire her, but she decided not to pursue getting contract offers from them due to not liking the environment, location, etc.

Basically what she did was:
1) found multiple places (8+) where she was interested in working in the city where we are moving to. 

2) before her off blocks, she called multiple places to set up working interviews where she would spend 4 to 8 hours at the hospital as a student doctor. She would basically shadow a doctor, get to go in to appointments, ask questions, get a vibe for the place, etc. None of these were paid, they were extensions to the phone interviews she had to do with recruiters. Every clinic she called accepted and let her do the working interview, some places did a phone interview before but others did it after. She would sometimes speak to the person in charge if it was a small clinic or a recruiter if it was a corporate clinic. Some recruiters reached out to her as well when she updated her resume and LinkedIn profile.

As a side note, she had done a 2 week externship with one of the places she got a contract offer from. Another one of them, she had done an externship with one of their partner hospitals, so she had a good recommendation from them. Both of these externships were in her third year.","Medical Doctor.

Frozenshades,"I went to a lecture recently and the speaker said everyone always pays attention to new client numbers but not enough on retention. How many of those clients are back within 18-24 months? All of those animals should have needed something in that time frame. Is our communication (namely digital) up to snuff to keep clients engaged and coming back for those wellness and vaccine appointments?

This speaker also did say that the general trend has been business slowing down with a return to pre-pandemic levels for a lot of areas and clinics. January felt slow as it often is after the holidays but we’ve been pretty busy. It’s a balancing act for the clinic; is the practice simply not grown enough to support the number of vets they have hired? If so are they anticipating growing into that? Is it just a slow period? With how hard it is to find vets right now, how tough of a spot would they have to be in to let you go knowing when they need someone again in the future it will be a tall order? 

Are the other doctors at your practice similar or are they busy? It also can take time to build clientele when you’re the new doc people don’t know yet.Reviewing medicine notes from school and clinics would be reasonable too. I did research for 3 years after vet school before taking a small animal GP job. It was intimidating after the time away from clinical medicine but you’ll be fineI reviewed through a lot class notes and spent extra time on topics I felt unsure about. Reviewed surgery notes and videos etc, didn’t jump into any procedures solo straight away. I did have plenty of anatomy review in the interim though, did a lot of necropsies and pathology stuff for studies.Spays are tough. Don’t rush and exposure is your friend. If you’re struggling to find something or expose something, extend your incision a little bit. Sometimes a centimeter or two makes all the difference between sweating it out for 45 minutes and an easy 20 minute procedure. It all heals the same.I feel similarly. Some days are shitty but overall paid well and have a good schedule. Like most careers there are good jobs and bad ones. The affordability of school is one of the huge problems and probably the main reason I’d say to beware. Salaries have gone up for sure but not enough to where a 1-2k plus monthly loan payment doesn’t hurt. I know people resigned to pay the minimum on income based repayment until the loan is forgiven. They simply can’t pay enough to make a dent in it and afford their living expenses.My PhD showed me the level of bureaucracy and petty bullshit in academia. Sometimes I do miss a quiet day of cell culture work or reading papers in the office, but grass is always greener right? The general public can be insufferable, but clinical medicine pays a lot more lol.Personally I also have reservations about relief work for a new grad. Unless you land gigs where longer term relief is needed like maternity leave or serious injury/illness, you’re facing new situations all the time. New practice environments, different softwares, different staff, different clients and pets. You have to have some combination of being selective of your jobs, being adaptable to a clinic’s working conditions, and being confident and steadfast in the way you do things, even when clients whine about how that’s not what Dr. X does. There are people who thrive with that, but it adds possible extra challenges to contend with day to day, to where I could see a new grad who is not fully competent nor confident in their medicine yet struggling.You definitely can, there were older people in my class. But plan carefully and reconsider your timeline. 

3-4 years to finish undergrad/your pre req classes.

4 years of vet school. 

1-2 years of internship.

3 year radiology residency. 

So you could definitely be a DVM in 10 years if you start college right away with a full time student course-load, but not a board certified specialist. You may not get into vet school your first attempt, many don't. And radiology is a competitive residency so you could do 1, 2, 3 year internship years with no guarantee of a match. And all those intern and residency years you make poor money for hard work.You certainly can, and there are some technicians that earn specialty certifications and work at universities or specialty hospitals. 

The fact that you ask that though, sort of tells me you're not really sure what you want to do. Being a vet tech vs a veterinarian are just totally different paths with very different day to day experiences and very different responsibilities and expectations.Ah! Yes, definitely volunteer and/or work as an assistant and/or kennel help. You'll need animal and veterinary experience hours as well as professors and veterinarians willing to write recommendation letters for you to apply to vet school. Vet tech classes for the most part will not fill prerequisites to apply to a DVM program so it makes little sense to become a licensed technician first.Seems pretty split among answers and discussions I’ve seen. I know some people love it there, but others find some of their policies problematic. It would be weird having clients everywhere and people watching you do surgery and stuff, but I suppose you can get used to that.

Jhoag7750,"If my employer told me that I had to do euthanasia that went against my inner judgment as the advocate for the pet, you can believe that I would walk out their door and never come back. As a veterinarian, I do indeed impose my own conscious evaluation of the pet and its optionsbefore agreeing to ever conduct that procedure. That is my right and if it’s not honored, I’m gone.Hey doc - fellow doc here - you need to go and talk to the office manager as a first step. Your entire environment there is toxic so it’s not just you. Unfortunately, very likely your office manager is a part of the toxicity so you may not get very far with that person and you may have to go higher up. I don’t know what your structure is but there will be someone higher up. remember this is work not a friendship, so don’t think you can bond with them and make friends with them, you don’t have to. But you can look them in the eye, and with a very pleasant smile on your face you can say hey I am a doctor, I do know what I’m doing, please put a cool pack on that incision as soon as the patient’s temperature is high enough and they’re able to thermal regulate. You also might check and see if the technicians have their own manager because I guarantee that toxicity between that entire team and all its members. Go and talk to the other doctors as well.
Oh, by the way, you don’t suck. Being able to do a dog spay in 45 minutes is pretty damn good so be proud of yourself. No one expects you to be perfect overnight, don’t go for speed, speed will come with experience. Also, remember incisions heal from side to side, not and to end, so if you need to make space for yourself, do it. if something feels Hinky about a patient, don’t do the surgery. Be sure you are getting pre-anesthetic bloodwork that includes a CBC, tick panel, testing, and basic chemistry.
If they are not able to get along with you, you need to talk to their bosses. If it hasn’t improved by the end of your contract, then it’s time to move on. Do not think of that as a failure on your part, think of it as a lesson to them about creating toxic workplaces.

PetsMD,"I'm 3.5 years out of school in small animal practice. I did a year of GP (during COVID) before starting to dabble in emergency. Everyone is different but I think my first year in GP only was necessary - it let me see a variety of things under less intense circumstances (i.e. I had other Dr's available to talk to rather than just by myself in an after hours clinic), it let me learn what treatments worked and what didn't, it let me figure out how to explain conditions to owners and just generally figure things out. Then I started dabbling in ER for a challenge and did a mix of GP and ER for just under a year. The constant flipping of days to nights and back was rough on my body and not sustainable long term. I moved to a GP practice that was a better fit for me and I now mostly do work there and do 1-2 weekend ER day shifts a month. This is a happy balance for me right nowI think if you have a good mentor that makes a world of difference! The ER I was at was more urgent care, so after hours and weekends. It wasn't a specialty hospital although we had the ability to call in specialists during the weekdays. So it was mainly former or current GP vets doing emerg work for a change or on the side. The clinic I was at was also very understanding that I was newer and hadn't dealt with a lot of ""big and scary things' yet. So the owner would buddy up with me for the first few hours each shift, she'd leave somewhere between 10pm-12am depending on what was going on so she could help take some of the bigger things that came in and I could learn. She was also fine with me calling her at any point through the night if I needed. She was also ok if i paused the line and sent patients elsewhere because I had enough on my plate and couldn't deal with that many patients at once. I found once I had 8-12 patients in the whole line (hospitalized, being worked up, waiting), I'd start to feel the panic set in and pause the line until I could deal with what was in front of me then open up again. This was absolutely paramount and I purposely worked there even though it paid less than a clinic 10 minutes more drive the other direction from my house because I wanted that mentorship and support.


In terms of case load, I find it's easily 50% what you'd see in GP - vomiting/diarrhea, QOL/euth, eye issues, blocked cats, weed dogs, . 25-ish % is bigger and scarier times - pregnant animals in trouble (I hate dealing with pregnant things and neonates), dog fight wounds, surgical cases (pyos, FBs), resp cats, more potent toxins (Pet Poison Helpline is a life saver), had a seizure but seems ok now. And 25% or less is oh my dog panic - hemoabdomen, GDV, hit by car, drowned in pool, unstoppable seizures, things like that. So it took an adjustment but in the right environment for me it wasn't too bad. Now I mainly do ER as a mind break from the vaccine and annual and allergy appts and, not going to lie, the extra income 🤣","Veterinarian.

no_good_surgeon,"For me it's history first, then the physical exam.

Let the owner say the story. 
Pay close attention, find the ""plot holes"" and ask the owner more questions to provide more specific details (define the problem/problems, and refine problem/problems). It allows me to see what areas I need to focus on while performing the examination, what investigations or treatment I need to proceed with, after the initial talking part is done. 

Also, asking those questions back will build your bond with your client, as in, you made the client feel heard, and it's problems on the way of being solved.If you do otoscopy in a conscious patient, you will not always get to see the tympanic membrane, or the tympanic membrane might be covered by wax, or the ear canal is stenotic, hyperemiated and painful, making the patient  hate having it's ears examined in the future. 
It's way, way easier to examine it while the patient is under deep sedation/general anaesthetic.  You can clean the ears if needed, you don't have a patient that moves, you are the one that can move the patient in what position you would need to examine the ear drum.You can look on the Vet Times Jobs, for UK salary ranges. They give you a salary range for every job advert, but most of them these days show anywhere between 50k to 65k/year for a gp small animal vet. New grads usually earn around 40-45k. I think (but this is my opinion), specialist salaries aren't listed anywhere because they are established on the job interview. If you want to go to UK to specialise, you have to remember that there is a ""road"" for that: 1-2 years in GP on new grad salary, then internship, which will be paid even lower, then residency then specialist. 

Also, if money is your priority, you can earn a lot in a short time span if you do locum work mainly in ECC, but in this case you will need a lot of medical experience under your belt.I am not implying what they earn or don't earn. I am saying that the specialist salary is probably established on the interview at the referral they are working or about to work. 

What I am implying is that, if you are prioritizing how much you earn,  there are some ""fast"" ways to do that. Another thing I am implying is that, if you follow the specialising route, you will have to earn under the market value for a salary in the veterinary sector, for a while.In short, don't give phenobarbitone, or long term anti epileptics in conditions that are caused by liver dysfunctions or are secondary to electrolyte/metabolic imbalances. 
(1. It takes time to reach therapeutic dose; 2. Are actively metabolised in the liver or stored in the hepatocytes)

The way they formulated the phrase is ambiguous and I think it depends on the context. ( Say, what do you do when a patient with hepatic encephalopathy comes in with full blown status epilepticus, with what medication are you supposed to stabilise the patient? )Very common problem, in particular at very busy practices. Some of those thermometers end up either in really silly places, either their battery has died, and due to time and budget constraints, ended up in the trash. 

One way to sort the problem out is to have your own thermometer that only leaves your pocket when you use it. 

Same with the pens. 

Buy yourself a pouch you can wear, and fill it o with the basic necessities (scissors, forceps, etc), and keep your stuff as much as possible in there. Once I've started doing that, the number of thermometers and pens I would lose each month dropped to nearly 0.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

RedPenguinGB,"Looking at Vetspire, it seems radically.. coherent(?) compared to other PMSes I've seen. It's kind of funny, I'm surprised by good software now haha.

I've done a bunch of pricing research and the figures I've seen are crazy. $100-300 per user is super high, especially compared to other Vertical SaaS solutions in other markets. Do you think $25-50 per user would be a reasonable ask for something that does what Vetspire, Vetstoria, PetDesk, and VetPay does? I suppose you can call it a practice-in-a-box. That and switching support of course.

I've seen documentation for some PMSes that covered their APIs. That might let me move records programmatically. Is data loss a massive fear here or is it moreso just an inconvenience that can really screw with one's daily workflow?I've taken a look at ezyVet in my initial research. Having used stuff like Vercel to host stuff at work, all the tabs and odd UX choices were confusing to say the least. Why do you think it's intuitive? I feel like there's something I'm missing. I look at it and get confused but maybe it's because I'm not used to it? I don't know. Do you feel like the amount of training you needed to do for staff was substantial? Do you think that software more in line with modern UX trends (stuff that looks like Reddit and works like you expect, ex.: bottom tabs on mobile with familiar icons etc) would have reduced that?

I assumed that ezyVet being a cloud system, there wouldn't be much troubleshooting to do. Like with serverless databases you don't really worry about updating the host's software. What types of troubleshooting do you find yourself doing often? Why is HTML knowledge required for it? Does ezyVet just use it for invoice and SOAP templates? Surprising that you'd need a support call to resolve these, I'd expect it all to be user-accessible.

Speaking about your experience with that EHR system, would you say that space for customisability with reasonable defaults is the best way to build software like this? (what you can do with Notion using templates and fully custom Notion pages)

Speaking about your new clinic, congrats! Starting a new clinic is a whole thing and I can't imagine the complexity involved. Is there something that would make you consider trying out new software having all this experience? Or is it that just ezyVet makes things happen and it's good enough for that?

Do you think that requiring a tech-savvy admin is a barrier for people getting a lot out of ezyVet and other PMSes? Do many clinics have tech-savvy admins even?

Thank you for your comment, it really helped me understand a bit more about all this. Please feel free to answer as many questions of mine as you like, I know there's a lot of them. I'm just super interested in seeing if there's software I can develop that can outdo these solutions. It's still just an inkling of an idea, but it does seem feasible. Do you think it's a good idea to try making it happen? Thanks againJust had a very quick look through Neo's website and it definitely looks better than the scary Avimark/Cornerstone screenshots I've seen. I can see how it makes more sense than these. Is customisation a big thing for you in a PMS? How much customisation and what type (apart from invoices&soap templates) is the most important to you? I can see how cloud based stuff must've felt to use for the first time. In my profession, we've had cloud stuff for a while but, when I moved from a company that self-hosted a bunch of stuff, it was a breath of fresh air.

I can definitely relate to the cost-wise part of it all. Starting at $250 a month is super steep for stuff like this. Is switching software always a rough experience or have you had good experiences along the way? Are there some particular parts of switching that make it exceptionally hard (incorrect records, stuff not copying over, etc.)?

About less technical people, I can definitely relate to that. Just being a software engineer doesn't make someone technical, and I've had situations where colleagues were confused after we switched out a CI system or something else. Do you think this learning curve comes from most software not being super intuitive or it's just people being people? What are some of the issues you've had post switching?

Thanks for reading my post and sending a comment. I really appreciate your time.Do you think a cost in the neighbourhood of $25-$50 per user per month would be prohibitive for most practices? Where do you often see data mispreserved/removed while migrating systems? Are these SOPs just pieces of paper that document how one should do things at your practice and contain information specific to the PMS you're currently using?

I can see how this process can be tough. Tbh, looking at the systems I've seen so far, I wouldn't be switching at all because I wouldn't trust them to do that correctly haha. 

Thanks for your time spent sending a comment here. It really helps me understand what you guys need and are looking for.Thanks for taking the time to read through my comments and to reply!

I'm surprised to find out Vetspire doesn't actually work well. But I guess I did judge a book based on its cover. The whole voting situation is a horrendous disaster and I'm kind of shocked that this is even a thing that happens. Imagine if Microsoft did stuff like this with Windows. Absolutely bananas.

Yeah, you're completely right here. I'm definitely feeling like I have a lot to learn and have applied for jobs at local clinics but have more of a software engineering background rather than an IT one which is what most of them would be looking for. Still trying though. I'm considering just approaching vet clinics and seeing which ones would be willing to let me have a day in their life. I don't think many will go for it, but it's worth a try. I really want to understand what's needed to make this happen.

You're also completely right on the practice type front. I have this massive idea that spans the whole pet care industry but to start out I'd like to focus on General Practice clinics as these are the ones I know people in + have the most knowledge about. Later on, I'd like to focus on other practice types. I don't want to make a one-size-fits-all solution because here one size really doesn't fit all.

I don't want to follow in Vetspire's footsteps. Tbh, I'd rather build separate pieces of software for particular clinic types because even in one clinic type there's multiple scopes you need to cover (does it work well for the vets? does it work well for the finance people? does it work well for the managers? etc). I still need to draw up the requirements and solidify my plan, but that helps a lot. Is there something specific Vetspire failed to do for you? I'm trying to understand where that generalised approach made things difficult for you. Thanks again for your time. This helps a lot with understanding what you guys need.Thank you so much for the in-depth reply! It's super exciting and interesting to find out more about what you work with daily. Definitely won't be boring to me. You've had quite the career! Congrats on the professional success and I'm happy you've found a place to settle down. I'm still looking for mine and trying out a variety of cities/countries and hope to find a nice place where me, my fiancée, and my cat can buy a home and relax.

It's really cool to see how that workflow can pan out in a high speed place like a vet hospital. Short versions of data seem important. The colour coding etc seems to drive that. Is the current system as efficient/good as it gets or do you think there's space for improvement here? I get how making these quick decisions can help, especially with the rising percentages of pet ownership and, I assume, the implicitly increased required minimum capacity for a practice. Am I understanding right if I'm seeing that you're using ezyVet's customisation to match up your shape/colour/etc system with what is on the PMS? This also helped me understand that ezyVet's tabs are intimidating-looking but highly intuitive because they're structured from big concepts to small details as opposed to just being an assortment of random stuff.

Ah yes, printer issues. The bane of anyone's existence. I can never get the buggers to work right. Rude little devices. With formatting and HTML, do you think a no-code visual builder will help? Not just block-based but one where you can just drop a block in its suggested location and then drag&drop to where it needs to be? No more margins, paddings, and `position: relative;` to worry about, just WYSWIG.

About the financial permissions, would retroactive discounts be the only thing you'd keep to yourself? I can get why that one should need approval but I'm struggling to come up with more examples that aren't hindsight vision corrections of invoices etc.

I'm glad to hear you're happy with ezyVet. I've struggled with finding software that works with me too (code editors, visual design tools, etc.) so I can get that feeling you get when it all just clicks into place. Maybe once I have a product ready I'll be able to change your mind 😂.

It's also good to hear the no-admin is more common than I expected. This means small practices also get to benefit from PMS' (if they can afford them from what I'm reading). It's also good to see a feeling of community. I've read a bunch of articles about vet burnout etc so that feeling must be super important.

Thanks again for your tips and knowledge. This really helps and I've gotten so many insights from this. I can tell you're experienced with this and I'm glad I got to talk to you about it. It's super exciting stuff. I'm still nailing down the specifics of my idea but once I do get them and come out with something, I hope you'll hear about it through the grapevine.Thanks for chiming in! My idea is a cheaper $15ish per user plan up to X users for smaller practices with features that they need most and then $25-50 for larger practices with stuff for bigger businesses like multi-location support (ie. multiple buildings or something along these lines?) etc. I'd want it to put the smaller practices first because of the current vet group acquisition movement that's going on.

Wow, that sounds like a horrible and unacceptable process. I get now why this process is something so many people are reserved towards. Data loss during system migration is horrible and pretty much the worst case scenario imho. That's subpar and I wouldn't want that to happen. The only troubleshooting that should be going on (in my head) is when you actually switch. It should be just done with afterwards.

Again, thanks for saying all of that. It's been super helpful in getting why migration is a big scary thing. That definitely sounds like a program issue from the PMS' side. Seems like I could do better here because really coding something that doesn't lose species data during migration isn't a super complex task. They should be doing much better.

This also ties into why I'm considering doing this. I work at the cutting edge of software and it's horrifying to hear that you guys have to deal with stuff I've seen as a thing of the past for a good while now. Crazy to think we have ChatGPT, GPUs that can do math faster than the collective brainpower of humanity, and PMS software that can't copy labwork and species data correctly.","Other.

Is there a different procedure for each?Thank you.  She wouldn't be getting anything published from the summer program so her best bet appears to be to go back to the same hospital and work under the same cardiologist as last summer and get her ""in"" that way.  She seemed to have a good rapport with this doctor.Yes, this externship is with the private company which has the residency program so it looks like she will need to just keep getting face time with them as much as possible.

Papio_73,"I wish I knew about the animal research field sooner, I never perused being a vet tech as I didn’t want to work at a general practice. I am not in the position to go back to school but man I wish I knew then what I know now.The same thing kind of happened to me; after working as a kennel assistant at a private practice I was sure working at a clinic was right for me: my boss is a personal hero and treated me very well but I wasn’t sure about settling as a vet technician as I felt this feel as I wanted something “more” after working in a clinic and aimed for general biology. I was hoping to become a zoo keeper but asides from the intense competition after working at a job (not related to animals) that didn’t give me a good work life balance and burnt me out (they made me work 12 day weeks and holidays while keeping me just under 40 hours so not to give me benefits) I wasn’t so sure about zoo keeping.

They can identify the traffic as a VPN, maybe even as a Myst VPN. They will not see the contents of the traffic that VPN users are passing through your node though. It's just a bunch of encrypted channels. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10l8mft/can_my_isp_detect_if_i_am_running_a_myst_node/j5wdczx/  Make sure you've got a backup of your data directory, and you can always restore it afterwards. Keep the backup somewhere other than the node, of course. 

The relevant parts of the documentation for backup/restore are at [this link](https://docs.mysterium.network/for-node-runners/migrating-your-node#:~:text=Migrating%20to%20a%20linux/raspberry%20node). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/x50jy8/as_a_node_runner_what_happens_if_i_format_my_sd/imzlf8z/  The node can see as much as anyone with control of your local network could see. If someone wants to sit there and mirror traffic from their node, they can see destination IPs and traffic types that node users are makin use of. But unless your traffic is really old school and unencrypted, the node operator actually can't see the actual traffic, just destination IPs and types. 

If you're sending, say, HTTP traffic (not HTTPS) through a node, and a node operator were to setup a way to capture all outbound traffic from the node, then yes, they could execute a man-in-the-middle attack, capture all of the traffic, reassemble it, and examine it. Pretty much nothing is unencrypted these days though. 

Keep in mind that with Myst, it's not end-to-end encrypted because the end isn't the node, it's the destination servers. As in, if a Myst user wants to visit [http://unencryptedexample.net](http://unencryptedexample.net), their traffic is encrypted from Myst endpoint to Myst node, at which point the node decrypts the traffic and routes it normally - unencrypted - to the destination server. 

This isn't unique to Myst though, it's true for any VPN; you're just moving to point of origin to the internet. This is why the web now defaults to HTTPS and most other protocols implement some type of encryption. It makes sitting in the middle pretty useless, there's nothing valuable to be gained from mining which IPs exit node traffic is routing to.

Even if verified partners have a clause in their agreements that say they can't torrent, can't partake in illegal actions, etc... Nothing technically stops this from happening. A partner could easily blast traffic that would get your ISP to shut you down. You could complain about it after the fact, and Mysterium would likely throttle or shut off the partner... But the damage is done at that point. My suggestion is that if you you don't know for a fact that your ISP will disregard legal notices sent to them, don't run an app like this. You really have no way to protect yourself. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wuy5hx/what_is_mysterium_verified_partner_traffic/ildeomi/  It will mostly depend on your exit node. One of the easiest ways to detect a VPN is to see that user traffic is coming from a datacenter. Users don't work in DCs, so when their traffic comes from there, someone is tunnelling it. With Mysterium, you can filter between residential and non-residential IPs. Non-residential nodes will give you the same experience as most VPNs - detectable, and blocked. But if you pick residential, your traffic looks like normal home traffic to the service you're accessing. 

So, filter for only residential nodes and you'll be fine. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wq7761/is_myst_vpn_good_at_being_undetected/iklf97a/","Other. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Other"" as it discusses various topics related to running a Mysterium Network node, but",Other

Hey guys 
I had written in another post detailing about my aspirations to become a vet one day and especially work more with wildlife, I still wouldn’t mind working with other animals as well. 
I am currently a senior in undergraduate and my current gpa is 2.44 , I have 2 semesters left , I am expected to graduate fall 2024. I am worried about how my journey is going so far in veterinary medicine because it hasn’t been the best and I will do my best to keep my story short. I relocated to America from Africa at the age of 13 , idk why I didn’t fully quite know I wanted to be a vet , it’s like I always knew deep inside that my fondness for animals is way deeper and I would always go above and beyond taking care of them the best way I knew how to do it since I was young , especially the stray animals back in my country. Anyway after coming to America , I graduated high school with a 3.9 gpa then went to community college for 2 and a half years where I was focused on international relations and international business , I have always been into humanitarian work as well , fast forward my advisor at the college asked me about how come I have never thought about veterinary medicine and all I do is talk about animals , that’s when it clicked to me that I am in the wrong major and I should pursue veterinary medicine , at this point I was like 21/22 years old. So I graduated from the community college with a decent gpa , I believe it was like a 3.4 and then I applied to do animal science pre vet track at the state university then I later changed it to food science pre vet track. My life started going downhill after freshman year of university and I would say that most of my undergraduate life has not been the best , I experienced a lot of racism , loneliness, depression, getting sick etc , just shit happening and I lost control of myself.  life was just hitting me from all sides and as a result of all that I think it was my sophomore year I started drinking a lot and I ended up getting 2 duis 2 years apart, so now I have a class A misdemeanor on my record. I decided to take a break from school and go back to my parents and work on myself and my life and seek therapy etc

I actually just resumed school this fall , after taking a break for almost 2 years , while I was on break I worked at the humane society and 2 other vet clinics as a vet assistant and I was full time there so I know I have a lot of hours when it comes to that. I have been seeking therapy and taking the alcohol classes and stuff , I have been sober for almost a year now and I know I still have a journey ahead of me fighting alcohol, I am happy to say that I did really well this semester and after everything I have been through , I do see some hope for me in the future , at the same time with a low gpa and 2 duis , am questioning all that 

I am currently 27 years old and I know that I really fucked up my undergraduate, sometimes I wish I could go back to freshman year and start all over and make better choices but I never did. So now that I am expected to graduate in a year , I plan to raise my gpa to atleast a 2.8, I met with my pre vet advisor and we discussed taking courses with more weight that would replace the ones I failed which is like 3/4 classes I think , I know the duis are definitely also another hurdle for me in vet school and career world 

Yes  my story is complicated and fucked up but I am looking for any advice anyone has to give me out there, anyone with similar experience or know anyone who has 2 DUIs and got into vet school or became a vet 

Although 27 feels old and that am super behind , I also know am still young and I don’t plan to apply for vet school anytime soon, I figured I should give it atleast another 2/3-4 years from now especially with my duis 

I am currently stuck on what should I do after getting my bachelors ? Should I just go straight to the work force or pursue a masters and what trajectory should I take so that I can be considered a candidate for veterinary medicine in the future or should I just kiss all of it goodbye since I have no chance whatsoever? 
Also my advisor told me that getting into vet school might be possible in the future but getting a dea license is where things might be challenging. We did a little research on it and we saw that if you are a felon then you are already disqualified from getting it or you would need to plead your case but with a misdemeanor and depending on how long ago it was , there’s a slight hope there but it varies case by case. 

So I know that all of these things won’t be easy for me and I have a lot of hurdles and challenges to overcome in the future. However am willing to do all it takes to get there one day even if it will take me the next 8-10 years of my life. I love animals so much and I grew up around so many stray animals and my own pets and also wildlife so I don’t know what else I would do with my life if not taking care and being there for animals.

pandaperson46,"Any idea when they'll re-upload?Hi! This is definitely a tough one. Unfortunately, many places will allow you to go shadow but likely will not hire you on their payroll for just a extended break or summertime experience. By doing this at the same place a few times, however, they may recognize your commitment and eventually hire you part-time for when you're in the area.

The unfortunate reality of trying to get veterinary hours... 

Does this answer your question? Or are you referring to just general shadowing experience?I'm sorry... The NYC area can be tough with this type of stuff. I would first off say that you will unlikely get a place that will hire you, but I think you should be able to find a place to let you shadow to get that experience and those hours in. I like to think that so many veterinarians have been in the same place as you and would like to help.

In my experience, I think that people are more receptive over the phone rather than email. I'd encourage you to call the front desk of a couple places you are interested in and ask to speak with the hospital director or leave your contact info!

I know they carry love to their humans..and my goal is for them to always reunite 💛 Do great medicine, advocate for my patient, and give my all for the best patient care ☺️THIS! I have many reasons to love ER..and schedule is one of the main reasons tbh! (ECC/CC LVT pursuing DVM to work ER exclusively!) 😊LVT here. I would say for technician level, not really super important. It will come handy for a deeper understanding of disease processes and in pharmacology. Are you doing a bachelor's in Animal Science then doing tech school? Are you planning on pursuing vet school? Animal Science degree is different than tech school. Imo doing both is a waste of time, if you are planning on vet school..go the animal science  BS route and make sure you get good grades. The average GPA for most US vet schools is 3.6 and up. Hope this helps 😊I see. Are you wanting to stay in the vet field in small animal? I'd advise you look at the content of both degrees. Animal science route will include a lot about large animal, animal management and care, and SOME medical stuff. Imo getting a bachelor's to move up to an assistant role is a waste of time and money. Doing a 9 month VA program would be beneficial for that purpose. If you are interested in management or government jobs, then do animal science. Also keep in mind that an assistant will not make much money regardless of the degrees. An LVT however will make more compared to a VA. Expand your horizon on your career goals and don't commit your time and money to something that seems like a good idea for 1 specific purpose. I don't wanna sound like I am shutting you down...it saddens me when I see a VA who wants to get more experience and move up and they have BS but make 12-15 an hour (depends on which state you are in). Versus an LVT who can make up to $50/hr (state dependant, specialty, experience). Versus an animal science BS holder- manager at a cattle facility that could be making up to 70k a year (state and experience dependant). Have you look at COL where you are at? Do you know VA vs. LVT/CVT duties in your state? Are you in a privately owned practice? Corporate practices will sometimes sponsor their VA's to get their license/certification and will aid in tuition. I am sure you will land where you are meant to be doing..don't ever feel stuck and prioritize your mental health and ur work-life balance.","Veterinarian.

Boople_noodle453,"UK Veterinary nurse here. Qualified for 12 years and in practice for over 15 year. what do you wanna know?

PCA/VCA is a really good starting point as you will get an honest view of the profession to decide if you want to jump into training as an RVN or not. Veterinary can be a very fulfilling profession if you can find the right practice to fit you. There are many options once qualified aswell.

Veterinary isn't just all hugging puppies and kittens, its very emotionally demanding. You will see people at their best and worst. You need to like working with people as much as animals in this job to survive. I hope you have a strong stomach as well cause you will see some sights. 

Personally I love my job but its taken a few years and a few job moved to find the fit that I wanted. The pay isn't always the best but it is getting better. As with any job its alot of who you are working with in your team as much as the job you're doing. 

If you don't mind the reduced salary then I would say you have nothing to loose starting a PCA postition and seeing how you feel.

RIP old man. Literally steps from his door and he wouldnt even come put the old man down. Best part is he called the cops on me, now knowing I was a cop I guess, and my boss came out and wrote him a whole bunch of citations after hearing my story(unregistered OHVs, Trailer, and expired reg on cars, debris in front of his house and some H&S stuff for improper medication storage).

If you go the tech route you can make an okay living if you know where to look. If you specialize, you won't be wealthy but you can make a little more than the average cost of living in a lot of areas. Doctors make more of course, but they can easily find themselves in a lifetime of debt. The schooling is a pretty massive undertaking as well.

1st time on call was when it hit me.This sub is full of people who gave up on their dream of being a vet due to family pressure and are asking later in life if it’s too late to still go to vet school 

Don’t listen to us and don’t listen to themIf you’re on salary then you need to have an increase every year or you’re taking a pay cut.

You now know that they are willing to discuss if you reach out first. So reach out.

Be prepared to know exactly what you want and what you’re going to ask for. If you are willing to walk, your position will be stronger.

If they accept your first request, it doesn’t mean you should have asked for more, it means you asked for the right amount and they understood your valueEastern Canada:

Surgeries are booked out 4 or 5 weeks. Appointments are always full. Ended up shifting one of the doctors to walk-in clinic 3 days a week because we had so many urgent cares every day it was wrecking our scheduleThese types of stories don’t get into the details of jurisprudence. I don’t know about this particular case but these types of things are often done in conjunction with the veterinary staff of the zoo.

The veterinarian is the one under whose license the work is being done. They either ran it by the state licensing body or have done so in the past and bringing in assistance from the human medical field has precedence.

When I was in vet school, they worked with a human dentist on some cases. We had boarded surgeons but no dentist. There was enough similarity in the anatomy that their skill set was very helpful to the case

TL;DR  There was most likely a licensed vet on the team under whom the work was being done for licensing purposesThe gap for some specialties can be relatively small if you compare GP to a specialist in academia depending on the school/location. 

If you compare private specialist to GP the gap is substantial for most specialties. Rad and path have the added advantage of being able to work remotely so they can take advantage of living in a lower cost of living area and still have the ability to consider job opportunities for multiple companiesSome do, some don’t. It’s not an egregious policy either wayYep, explaining  extraneous conditions on the phone always keeps people from saying “But I was told on the phone…”It has nothing to do with your license as you are not practicing veterinary medicine.

Most jurisdictions will have Good Samaritan laws that protect those who attempt to render aid in an emergency situation. You can check your local laws if you’re worried.

Yes, you should stop and render aid unless there is something about the situation that makes doing so unsafeFair enough. I assumed OP wasn’t planning on doing any of those things and was asking about routine 1st aid.

We all know where assumptions get us thoughDr and DVM together is repetitive and unnecessary.YesThat’s a broad question.

Are you in vet school? 
What year?
What country?
What is it that you’re most worried about?
Do you have any specific challenges (ADHD, learning challenges, etc)?Hey, you’re ahead of the game. I did one dog spay prior to graduating and being turned loose on the world. 

u/calliopeReddit is right about the Miller’s knot though for sure.You’ve asking two wildly different questions here and I’m reading it as if you put them on equal ground as far as what concerns you.

Cost of exam varies greatly by geography and no one can give you a real answer without that info. Having said that, I would consider anything around $100 for an exam as normal and acceptable. If you are in a free market, your clients will (should) determine if they are getting value for their money for the service they receive and go somewhere else if they aren’t.

For the cremation question, I agree that manager is either:
A) A raging asshole to begin with and this is par for their personality or
B) Suffering from some level of burnout.

Either way they are not making decisions that are in the best interest of the client or the clinic in this caseYou may both be having a hard time adapting to a new working relationship.

You’ll need to sit down with them to hash this out and be clear from the outset what each of your roles are in the hierarchy. If you are both equal under a regional manager, make sure you explicitly state that and that they acknowledge it.

If you don’t feel comfortable with this conversation one-on-one or just want another party there to make sure there is no misunderstanding going on, invite your regional director to sit inCan you be a vet assistant without a degree? Yes

Do they make good money? No

Many of us started out as kennel assistants (I’m a vet and I started as a volunteer kennel helper at a clinic)If you’re planning to practice in US/Canada, super annoying doesn’t begin to describe getting licensed from a non-accredited school. The process is >$10k and can take years.

For me, I’d pick a school that teaches in my primary language. Other than those 2 things, it can be a great experienceWhat part of the world are you in? I know some systems start a 6-yr program after high school to encompass undergrad prereqs and then vet school.

If you’re in a traditional North American system, in what reality is this “starting late”. Although not required, most are going to get a 4-year degree prior to starting vet school. Graduate high school at 19 and undergrad at 23. On top of that, how many of us get in on our first year applying? I was lucky enough to get in on my second year of applications and counted that as a win.

TL;DR - You’re fineThings that may help you decide:

-Google veterinary suicide rate. Even jobs that have a good work-life balance are going to have some notable stress. There are certainly alternative career paths (ones that deal less with the general public) but you still have the stress of vet school to get through

-Get experience working in as many different fields of veterinary medicine as you can

-Research entrance requirements for the vet schools you may be interested. You can tailor your college path to focus on what they are looking for and still have options after if you change your mind or aren’t able to get inIt’s (generally) not a thing.

But… anything is possible in a free market if employer and employee agree on it. 

What was the associate’s duties when they were hired? If I hired a vet and told them that they were going to do surgery and appointments, they could ask all they want later to do just surgery but that’s not going to happen. The only way that can work is if there are enough surgeries for them to generate the revenue needed to justify their salaries and they aren’t poaching surgery time from colleagues that also want to do surgery.What a dysfunctional mess. 

I will say, my office manager is not my boss. If I signed on with the owner to do surgeries only, they could bitch and moan all they wanted about nobody taking walkins and it wouldn’t phase me. I’d tell them no and if they’ve got a problem with it they can take it up with THE boss.

If what they are saying is true that isI guess it depends on the individual and the school.

The pass rate for NAVLE at my alma matar is around 97%. I don’t think it’s ever gotten down to 95%.

A fail rate of 20% would be bad enough but no accredited school would have a fail rate of 40%. Schools have to maintain a pass rate of at least 80% by the time of graduation to maintain their accreditation.

If your friend goes to a non-accredited school, I suppose it’s possible. That would certainly be a shitty school if that were the case.

My classmates were very supportive as were my professors. I was by no means an exceptional student and I passed easily thanks in large part to those supports.

Generally to answer your question, I know it’s (on average) harder to get into vet school than med school but never got the impression from the MDs I know that the curriculum was intrinsically more rigorousNo","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

EuglossaMixta,"To my knowledge, this actually happens all the time with primates due to them being so close to humans, especially for any surgical need. Likely there was an entire veterinary team also present and participating in the treatment and care. So more of a professional collaboration over this human-like animal that bridges that gap. Also I’m pretty sure as long as there is a veterinarian around, in certain facilities like zoos and research hospitals, human doctors can do surgery. I know that in places like a human research hospital that use mice and rats, often it’s PhDs and grad students who do smaller procedures on the animals in their research and MDs doing the more challenging procedures. They just have the veterinary team check on the animals and make sure they’re doing okay.I’m not an expert, so anyone with better info, please correct me, but I believe you can still put in experience hours in from high school on no matter how long ago that was and just give what information you can. They also have a box to check when inputting experience that asks if they can call and verify this experience, you can check no since it was so long ago. I don’t think it’ll look bad because it’s easily explainable and I assume you have more recent, more important experience that they’ll be more focused on anyway.Hi! Not in vet school yet but currently in my grad program, I use a surface pro for everything and really like it for taking notes. Lots of my friends use iPads and have a MacBook at home and like their set up. The only person that doesn’t like their situation is my friend that has a PC at home and uses an iPad for notes at school. She says that transferring the notes is annoying and just would have opted to not have gotten the iPad. I personally am still deciding if I’ll just get a newer surface or switch to iPad since mine will be dead by the time I start vet school. Anyway, I hope this helps! Seems to be that any tablet device is great for school/notes though!I’ve seen lots of examples of GP and some LA or industry but are there any examples of exotic vet salaries? I’ve been told they tend to make less than GP but I’ve seen a large interest in a lot of vet students wanting to go into this area so it would be helpful to see some of this infoI love this advice <3 thank youYikes","Other.

Sakitwee,"I would also be willing to claim some from you.What are the best websites to study USA in practice laws and which department controls what - for example for turtles?Yes thank you so much! Also the post you made, tysm helped me regain my sanity to battle this out again but for Nov-Dec of this year :)I don’t think it’s wrong to know that you passed a second time with extra time. I think it takes a better person to accept that they need the extra time to succeed than someone who is prideful that they don’t need the time when they really should. In the end no one is ever going to ask you how many times you took the NAVLE and what score you got.

I already graduated and if I don’t pass I will have to take it a 4th time. It is demoralizing especially since I did well in school. But I know I shouldn’t have taken it the 2nd time when I was so burnout on rotations. 

So don’t let it bother you so much you didn’t pass the first time. The test isn’t a great way to show we are competent vets. It’s made to be hard and mentally taxing. (Though for what reason I’m not sure). 

But never give up and never look down on yourself.https://www.vin.com/ce/MULT205-0124.htmHave u tried doing volunteer preceptorship observational work at either? Might give u a good idea of how the work environment is.

For me I chose to be a vet over MD because I love animals so much more. But it is super unfortunate that the salary for vets is so low. The vet salary really doesn't increase unless u specialize as a vet dentist or something and then get 250k+ but that's another 4 years of work.

My friend is an MD, and he doesn't think its worth it either. He's a family doctor and its really taxing to give people advice and they don't follow it and they are still mad at you. But he does make wayyyy more money so I guess that is a plus.

It pretty much weighs on you if you are capable with the lower wage and stressful conditions but love animals or if a higher wage and more annoying human clients to deal with.

Idk if this helped you but my best advice is to try volunteer observational work in both fields before you fully decide.Are you picky where you want to go? Or do you simply want to be a vet no matter what? I think the caribbean schools that are in the association are a good backup if you want to get in no matter what. At the end of the day, the client isn't going to care what school you went to, just if you know your stuff and if you are nice. You could also apply to overseas schools, I went to the Royal Veterinary College (super good school) and if finances are an issue, I was able to get full federal loans for tuition and accommodation as an independent with no parent help.  So it is possible to be a vet, it just depends on how picky or the want to be a vet. My gpa was a 3.2 because it lowered my last 2 years of college from commuting.Any suggestions should I do both Zuku and Vetprep questions? If I fail this I will have to take it a 3rd time.If they can fuck up like this, how can we trust them that they don't fuck up checking the exam answers and scoring us all? ? ? I think worrying about my results has shaved off at least 10 years of my life.Omg I came to this chat to see if anyone else got the email and now I’m freaking out and haven’t checked yetI think they want my money for the THIRD TIME NOW FMLProbably postponed for another day lolWell I will at least file the complaint. We should at least band together and do so. So it's not just swept under the rug.Plus it doesn’t matter if you think based on people you see study or not. There are plenty of people who have studied a lot and have done well in school and still have not passed the exam.I’m in the exact same position as you. Overseas school that graduated in 2023 and had to take it again and moved back to the U.S. I know it is a lot of pressure on us to pass this exam, but best to still keep positive no matter the outcome. (I say this but I kept having mental breakdowns the last few weeks waiting for these results 😅)pls no im on my 3rd try ;-;Omg I don't want to have to retake the exam because they fucked up what evenomg i had that exact question!yeah u do have enough time, but doesn't mean the later dates are available its a bit iffySame I want to join tooOr Atleast I’m going to contest them when I get my score back and it shows I didn’t pass.

And then might drag them to court. Because it is a ridiculous exam to begin with and is far more ridiculous on how they are dealing with it now.You're clearly not important enoughGuys please, Im currently on my period so its gonna hit harder than ever these results and Im going to be so upset if I'm so close and didn't pass. I took it for a 2nd time and I already graduated. I feel like a waste of space at this rate.I’ve gotten no email from IVCA yet, usually they email you that they are released.I want to pass I really do, I studied so hard, but also super anxious that I did fail. And then what am I going to do then?I’m a recent graduate and I did the GAB year but I got into it with a 3.2 gpa. I think the 5 year program isn’t bad either it gives your mind a little bit more breathe room so I wouldn’t feel ashamed in doing that.Lol same I’m not from the usa and failed the first time. But taking it again in 5 days. But I remember the first time taking it I was just so nervous the first 2 hrs in the exam my brain was not braining.Honestly I think this is the best advice. Pretty much just believe in yourself. I too am taking it again after graduating from a school outside the usa, and the biggest thing I just struggled with the first time was not taking practice questions to see how the exam is like and being so nervous the first 2 hrs in the exam. Even if ur score is the lower end on the practice, I think the test questions are easier.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

Pancakesmith,"I’m still pre-med so I’m barely racking up animal experience but from this side, I love having even a small part in making animals happier. A large part of my rolls have included cleaning up animal poop but I’ve never been happier cleaning up poop simply because I got to hang out all day with animals and know that I made their lives brighter ❤️☺️Thank you for the reminder☺️❤️ that is a great point. Thanks 😊I’m so sorry you had to experience this. Please remember you did the very best that you all could given the timing and situation. My mom who also works to save lives tells me to remember that in order to push through these tragedies we have to remember that our job is to do our very best since we can’t win every time.
I feel like that’s the only advice I have to not absolutely break down during things like this. I clutch on to it. I know it doesn’t make everything better but it’s like a reminder. 
But I understand the pain. I’ve been on the side of the pet parent who lost two young dogs traumatically due to sudden internal bleeding due to cancer and one day if I’m ever privileged enough to be on the vet side I hope I can still remember this advice from my mom. 

I just graduated undergrad and am prepping for vet school. This is all stuff I think about a lot but I just wanted to give you a verbal hug and remind you that you’re giving the gift of helping as much as you can which is so much better than leaving an animal entirely without an effort. 😔 

I think we always have to cope with not being able to save everyone and I also don’t know how other than to try to think of what my mama said. 
She works with children as a respiratory therapist and sees very tragic things too. 

*my spirit sends yours a hug as well as to everyone else who has to deal with this*This is great advice. Thank you.Yes, I relate to the asking. I think that’s so natural for all humans to do when faced with tragedy. 
The pup’s humans took the decision in their hands when they decided that. Perhaps they knew ribs could break during that and didn’t want that for their already suffering dog, or who knows why, but they decided and even if you do not know, they for whatever reason felt that would be least stressful for them and perhaps even the animal. 

I know we are going to be around a lot of hard things and I encourage you to see if you are able to speak with a professional therapist every now and then too since depression in our field is so high. It might help. Ik it’s helped me in the past with maintaining a positive mindset.

No_Percentage3491,"Think of it like a physician anesthesiologist and nurse anesthetist in terms of oversight vs running the actual case.

The LVTs I work with have a lot of additional administrative duties and bitch work like cleaning, which is arguably below their pay grade. 

Also, during a case, legally only a DVM (like an anesthesiologist) can prescribe medications to add to the protocol. An LVT and even a VTS still needs doctor permission. 

You didn’t actually ask about the difference in knowledge base, but that varies depending on the technician and their experience.

It's a 9-ish hour test that requires knowledge and extrapolation of that knowledge for problem solving.  It is administered by exam centers that also proctor exams for other major tests and you can't bring anything into the room with you.Go to whichever school will leave you with the least amount of debt when done.You will need to understand stats concepts for vet school such as positive and negative predictive value and standard deviations.  You will also need to be able to do basic drug calculations.    Undergraduate math courses are more advanced than anything you will have to do in vet school, but you are expected to have retained a baseline knowledge of concepts. Your college grades will help determine if you're a candidate for vet school application. Vet schools will want to see that you've already found ways to manage areas you struggle in academically by the time you've applied.  They may not care if you failed 9th grade math, but they will care if you failed a second year stats course.4th year sucks, but there are so many aspects of vet med that can be explored later on.  You have 3? months left of rotations.  Finish it, then take some time off to figure out what to do with your degree.Meal prep is the answer I need to also follow more frequently. If you pre-portion your meals, it can also help with portion control as well as having healthy choices ready and available.  I am a big snacker when I'm stressed, so something like trail mix or popcorn is a better option than sweets or chips.  I try to keep my bigger meal at lunch time and eat a smaller meal at dinner before bed, especially as I'm often eating dinner quite late. I keep tea bags at work to have a low cal beverage in the afternoons.

I find it hard to have a regular weekly exercise schedule, but I have some drop-in exercise classes that I try to attend.

Outrageous-Painter,"You can do this by creating multiple container of myst nodes and connect them to the network

Here is a simple python script to use the API to connect to another myst node:

    import requests as r
    import json import os
    url=""http://localhost:4050/""
    providers=r.get(url+""proposals"").json()
    proposals=providers[""proposals""]

    consumer_id=""your consumer id""
    print(provider_id)
    os.system(f""myst cli connect {consumer_id} {provider_id} wireguard dns=system"")

To disconnect you need to do a DELETE call on [http://localhost:4050/connection](http://localhost:4050/connection)

Now your virtual machine has a new network interface called myst.

You can now configure a proxy server in your container to use the myst interface

Here it is the configuration using squid:

    http_access allow localnet
    cache deny all
    tcp_outgoing_address 0.0.0.0 all
    dns_nameservers 1.1.1.1

cirena,"Relief is absolutely a way to [travel as a veterinarian](https://holidayvet.com/traveling-veterinarian/). A friend of mine got so burnt out in ER work that she quit and went full relief. She'd pick up jobs in towns around the National Parks to pay for her vacations. She'd do a week or two of work for a week or two of vacation, almost van-life style.Youch! Most US states are between $100-$500. So far, I've only seen 2 states that are $1000 (Alaska & New Mexico), and none above that.

With relief rates the way they are right now, you can earn your fees back in one shift, so I wouldn't see that as a massive barrier to working somewhere else.

That said:      
Some of the exceptions to ""at will"" that can make a termination illegal :

RosasharnSun,"So I’m a recently SA qualified vet. We had 2 people in our year from North America, both had biological science degrees with honours postgrads but both had to start in 1st year (and I’m sure you’re aware it’s a 6 year course with the first year basically being just non vet sciences). Once you complete your BVSc, to practice in SA you need to complete a compulsory community service year and you only can do it in the year after you graduated. No comserve = no council registration.
You can use the degree to practice in the UK, AUS and NZ without comserve.

OP is definitely a planet of its own. It’s in a very isolated part of town and some people struggle with that, especially in residence. There is a campus psychologist who comes 1 a week but her waiting list was always stacked and it would take months to see her. Pretoria north is functionally 30 minutes from Pretoria main. 

Residence the party/drinking culture is wild but there is space for studying. Academics wise they have changed a lot of things now even since my time - I was part of the last group to endure the block system and to have to have the equines module crammed into 1 semester. It’s definitely tough and a distinction is 75% (in the old days it used to be 65% but honestly the way they test it might as well be!). Admin tends to be on the disorganised side and you often get told of important things the day before (sometimes even the morning of!). And the exam paper setting - my mother is a medical professor and when I told her about some of them she would just gawp in astonishment. It’s not very standardised but hey suppose it makes you think in the fifth dimension

Species wise - expect a lot of ruminant theory  work. Majority of the theory is focused on ruminants throughout the modules. We do have dedicated smallies and equines modules. Wildlife is a very small one semester module in 5th year and exotics is an elective week during clinics. Majority of clinics was smallies rotations as that keeps the hospital ticking over financially.
Clinics are a very vigorous 18 months. The 1 week of ICU night shift rotation is infamous. Like anywhere there are good clinicians and bad clinicians. They do get away quite easily if they aren’t the nicest person to students. But for the most part they do their jobs really well and are good clinicians. 

But yeah doing the NAVLE if you want to go back to America to practice should be definitely on your mind. It’s an expensive test and I think for the SA guys (I was looking into it at a point but decided naaah) was about $10 000. Maybe it will be less if you have American degrees but the majority of the cost was the veterinary testing the and practical exams. 
Hope this helps - you definitely need to make this an informed decision and weigh up the reasons for going to SA. I wouldn’t say the standard of veterinary education would be higher than in the states. Definitely has its own flavour! Our political stability is a bit uncertain with the 2024 elections but that’s always a given. It’s a great country on the whole.","Veterinarian.

AmIAmazingorWhat,"Lmao did we get the same offer? Not really, but I just got a VERY similar offer. And I'm in the same boat as you where I really just want to know if it's ""reasonable"" or what to negotiate. In my case, there are a LOT of positives to my position beside the offer itself: desirable location, fantastic practice culture,  great work-life balance. I just want to know if I'm undervaluing myself or not.Not to steal OP's post... but if the practice offered reimbursement for all the things (license, DEA, CE, etc) as well as an ideal mentoring structure written into the contract, would that make it better/more even? I received a very similar offer and the opportunity itself is fantastic, I just don't have enough experience in the negotiating and hiring process to know what is a good compromise and what to push back on.It's sad, because I wanted to specialize (in equine internal medicine or advanced radiology) but after seeing what interns and residents go through in my vet school I decided it wasn't worth my sanity. I *love* advanced medicine, and learning, and teaching, and research, and I would have made a damn good resident and internist. 

But I want to see my fucking family, and ride my horse, and sleep more than 4 hours a night, and pay off my $300k student loans.

And so I watch the increasingly desperate ads from vet schools for interns, residents, and clinicians and wonder what they'll do when there's no one left.I was close friends with some residents and interns in my fourth year, and it physically pained me to see people call them bitchy and complain about them when I had watched those same residents and interns cry in front of me because they were so tired and overworked. Should they be lashing out? In theory, I'd love to say no. But it's pretty hard to be a sunny disposition and not get frustrated when you're running an entire hospital service with only students for help, your attending is MIA, and you haven't slept in 24 hours. 

The trickle down misery is so realI don't have a lot of suggestions, but I just wanted to say that we as veterinarians really appreciate that someone who isn't involved AT ALL in vet med cares so much about this topic that they looked into it and are interested in helping. 

Perhaps reaching out to the AVMA (the national group that is in charge of oversight of the vet school programs and such) and expressing your concern as a pet owner that veterinarians are experiencing poor working conditions and you want to know what they're doing about it.

One of the problems is that there seems to be no oversight: the AVMA likes to put out pretty words and ""suggestions"" like restrictions on student hours spent in clinics, but there are no consequences for programs that don't follow these restrictions. What this results in is that young vets are ""talking with their actions"" and not doing internships and residencies...which is going to (and has already) lead to shortages in specialties or select for people who don't care about fairness and just keep the same attitude, rather than anything changing. Maybe if the big organizations realized the general public is aware of their dirty laundry and concerned about their transparency and the blind eye they're turning, they would do a little more.Lmao this reminds me of our communication training. We had ""scenarios"" with paid actors, whom we had to placate and cater to and never ever be honest with despite ridiculous scenarios- one of them was a man with a cat who ate a vegetarian diet because he was vegan and the scenario was that his cat had heart failure and he refused to give it meat/taurine. 

I also was once told that ""I didn't show enough empathy,"" to a client whose fake cat had kidney failure. The way I approached it was to explain what kidney failure was, gave them the options, and then waited for them to process it and remained a calm sounding board and answer their questions. Wtf did they want, for me to cry with the fake client over their fake cat? 

Not once has anything from that stupid class ever helped me, and I always thought the way they coached you to speak sounded extremely condescending, like you were talking to a child.

Edit: FWIW, I have received rave reviews from my bosses about my communication with clients, even clients who have been prickly about seeing ""the new vet"" in the past. So whatever I'm doing is workingI can probably elaborate on what the previous poster is dancing around. What if your mentor isn't doing a good job, and you don't feel like you can go to them (or they're taking advantage of you- giving you cases that aren't good learning opportunities, being unavailable when you need help, etc.) but they're also your boss? How do you approach issues in your learning or place in a clinic when you are worried about your job security because the person you should be able to go to for advice is also the one screwing you over?Where did you go?!? My experience was similar to OPs although we had more opportunities to get large animal and exotics experience because our clinical schedule was very customizable. But everything else held true. I regularly pulled 80-90 hour work weeks between treatments, on call, weekend treatments, and paperwork.I didn't go to either, but I've heard good things about both. I've only known one person who went to Davis but she really liked it, I've known a few who either went to or worked with students from NC state and NC state sounds like maybe it coddles them a bit and makes it hard to get the experience needed to be a competent doctor fresh out of school (ie limited opportunities to do things like equine GP work because they don't have that as a rotation, less chances to put in catheters because techs do it most of the time unless you're really self-motivated and insist on doing it).

Definitely don't just take my word for this as most of it is second hand, I went to neither. I think both are likely good schoolsWe autoligated almost all our cat spays (even pregnant...) when I was doing a shelter med rotation. It made me incredibly anxious at first and I did not enjoy it but I eventually warmed to it. I had several I insisted on throwing ligatures on because I felt the pedicle was fraying too much to be comfortable pulling it enough to autoligate. It is tricky to maneuver the mosquitoes to grab the pedicle in the right spot to ligate, but there were only one or two ovaries (out of like 7 cats) that I genuinely couldn't get it, and the more experienced surgeons did it just fine. I'm not positive but I think we autoligated male dogs as well?

I LOVED autoligating male cats, very efficient, similar to a horse castration (my chosen field).

I just hate surgeries in general and am very happy never spaying a cat or dog again!The uterus we did with sutures, miller knots. But the ovary was autoligated similar to the testicle, clamping and twisting the pedicle around the mosquitos as close to the ovary as possible, then snipping off the horn/ovary, and doing the little autoligation push. I had a few where the pedicle sheared and tore while I was pushing the pedicle off the mosquitoes (I always noticed it before fully releasing, so no bleeding) and those ones I just kept my mosquitoes in place and slipped a millers knot down over my mosquitoes to tie deeper into the body cavity, and then ""finished"" the autoligation. It always felt more risky than the neuters, it didn't feel like a super secure grip on the pedicle to me. But it worked great in a shelter med setting with limited resources I guess 🤷‍♀️Huh that's interesting. Yeah it's definitely a bit awkward. I think there's a youtube video about it from the united states humane society that goes over high quality/high volume spay n neuter, but it's been too long so I don't remember what it was called!","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

It’s a steep learning curve but I had awesome mentorship to get me where I needed to be. It can be done, you just have to find the right place that will build the skills you will need.I chose where I wanted to work and didn’t actively look for places that advertised mentorship. I looked for private ownership (more flexibility), case load, species, doctor profiles, etc. In my interview I asked very pointed questions about how the practice would get me up to speed, how long training was, what to that looked like, etc. The staff at my practice is on the younger side (avg age under 40) but that translated into willingness to teach new grads high level medicine and good mentorship.Check with the state your job will be in.  Some require you to simply transfer scores, others require you to go through the process of licensing and then transfer the license to the new state.  If you only need to transfer the score, I would do the first time vault transfer.  Once licensed, you can then pursue licensing in your home state.I think most of us can agree they are doing damage control at this point. I think we can all agree that it is statistically improbable for the reports to contain everything for another student except their score or pass/fail status. 

But even if this were true, Name and ID information alone is enough for me to look up someone else’s score through the system. 

For example. If I knew someone’s name from my class and ICVA number, I could easily look up their birthday on the internet and log into the system and see if they passed and access their score report. I’m obviously not going to do that, but the fact that they are dismissing the information they did leak as unimportant shows their ignorance because the issue is less about the score or pass/fail.

I do not judge as long as they get to a humane decision in a reasonable amount of time and pay the bill. There are, after all, the ones that apologize later and never do it again after the initial outburst and me gaining their trust. These have become some of the best patient relationships at our clinic.Sincere question - IF vets hate the backyard breeders so much why do practices even need to see them? Here is Los Angeles there is no shortage of vet clients and prices have never been higher. I am in the process of purchasing a vet clinic that does low cost preventative health care to the community and I fully plan to offer those breeders an initial exam and a spay appointment. If they do not make the spay appt they will be fired as clients. With the city of los Angels offering zero breederpermits right now I have no business enabling these humans to produce or animals or in adding extra added value to their puppy sales. If they want to make cash off the backs of those animals they can pay oneof the expensive vet clinics to enable them.  BTW I feel you all should know that Euth rates in Los Angeles shelters for cats are 60-70 percent.  DOgs somewhere around 30% and managed intake has been a thing for over a year meaning the shelters will refuse cats, rabbits, birds and pocket pets and reptiles and they will not take owner surrender dogs.  Breeding in meth tents along freeways is a huge problem as are animal sales in home depot and Walmart parking lots.   TY all for indulging my rant. I look forward to your thoughts.I think a high end clinic is where they belong.  Taking resources from a low cost clinic that focuses on preventative health care while breeders make money off the backs of the animals ? It sure would be nice if they could be educated that this might be a party foul. Unfortunately sometimes having to pay higher costs isteh best form of education.  Make irresponsible breeding not profitable and maybe they will reconsider.I Mentor a second year vet student. I am not a vet.  I do love this kid like she is my own and I worry. I'll start that [change.org](https://change.org) petition. I'll send a letter to anyone who needs to see it. I do think though that in speaking up for people who may hesitate to use their own voices for fear of reprisals that it might be helpful if any you all DM'd me and told me 1) what you would like those in power to hear and  2) who those folks in power that have the ability to make change are.  I will happily fire off that missive for you all.  Keep your heads up.  The animals and the owners that love them need you to come out ok.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

That said, I have never been called Dr (name) by any of the staff unless they're talking about me to a client. Must be a cultural difference.NoI never had any particular love for them. I had an interest in science and comparative medicine. The only real way to pursue that interest was as a veterinarian.>pay is not a problem for me

Well it should be. That said a lot of veterinarians earn a very decent wage. It depends what area you go into. I was 89th percentile of earners (compared to the general population) after a year in practice.

>like putting down animals, 

Never been a problem for me. It really isn't a problem for a lot of people.

>what else should i do to prepare?

Nothing. Consider your options wisely though. You can do the American Bachelors degree follow by DVM pathway. Alternatively you can go to the UK, Ireland, Australia or New Zealand straight out of high school and complete your veterinary degree right away. Choice is yours.No it can't be revaluated. You'll probably past next time.PASSThis whole process has been quite stressful. I’m already a practicing veterinarian in my country. Then to actually not be able to get the results once they’ve come out….. I’m sitting in the pharmacy at work right now just waiting for this page to load!!!!!I think I had 10-15 questions on feline periuria throughout the exam. Not sure what that was about....YepThat worked for me. I created flashcards for the power pages and power lectures as well.So toxic that this is downvoted lolI forgot a fair amount of what I learnt in my first couple years of vet school by the time I was graduating honestly (5 year undergraduate degree, I still passed the NAVLE on the first attempt). It's why I'm spending a lot of time having now graduated relearning a lot of fundamental physiology and medicine by sitting down and properly studying these texts. 

Oftentimes I was just remembering enough key information from a power point slide to pass an exam. Now I am sitting down and reading, as an example, Nunn and Lumb's Applied Respiratory Physiology from front to back.

Perhaps I'm a particularly bad example of this but I feel that myself and many of my colleagues did not graduate with a meaningful understanding of what I would now describe as key concepts. As an example, I left vet school not really understanding the renin–angiotensin-aldosterone system pathways properly. Sure I could draw it out and name what was going on, but I didn't really understand it. It's only now that I've graduated that I could properly sit down and read Vander's that I've developed a better understanding of it.

Basically what I'm trying to say is that the curriculum in many vet schools is pretty lacklustre and the sheer volume of information you have to learn can result in a lack of meaningful understanding of many key concepts, resulting in them having to be learnt years after having graduated. This isn't to say that a graduate veterinarian is incompetent or stupid, just that a lot of learning will happen once they graduate.Some schools it's much lower than that. I think Arizona was 70% pass.Yeah it's not uncommon to be treated like absolute shit.

That said, I have never been called Dr (name) by any of the staff seriously unless they're talking about me to a client. Must be a cultural difference.> I'm not sure if there's a similar culture in veterinary medicine 

Yeah sort of the other way around because I guess it's more casual. If I'm being called over as ""Dr"" it's probably because my handwriting is atrocious and I'm being lightly ribbed.","Veterinarian.

shortchic88,"Hi there, unfortunately this field is very discouraging when it comes to pay. Average tech life is 5-7 years because of many reasons but pay is a leading reason. We do it because we love it not for pay.

Background: I've been in the field for 20 years, started as kennel and moved up to room nurse in GP.  Switched to ER about 4 years in and became a tech. Love ER and became lead tech then tech manager then practice manager of 24 hr ER and specialty clinic. I started going to tech school but as I was advancing I made more without the degree (live in Texas where it's not currently required). Externships are hard to get especially working 80hr weeks in the industry shortage. I came to learn that it's your ethic and the people you know. 

GP I was making $7.55/ hr in 2007 vs. ER started at $18/hr plus shift differential. Ended at $33/ hr as management and was hiring techs at $22-$28 based on experience not degree- what I have seen in the field a degree didn't mean much since I run circles around green techs with degrees. Not saying anything against it either.

Currently I manage an academy and make $85k which requires a bachelor's degree but once interviewed I was perfect for the job and they didn't require it- also was recommended which is why I really hang on it's all about who you know.","Veterinarian.

erlingspaulsen,"Nice! If anyone is hosting a Mysterium node and have a spare hard disk, it's very easy to run a Storj node alongside Mysterium. I do this on my Raspberry Pi 3. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/mnkau7/mysterium_x_storj_labs_a_partnership_to_link_the/gtz6qg2/  My Raspberry Pi is running the Mysterium Rasbian image. Then I just followed the Storj installation guide and installed Docker engine, downloaded their Docker image and started the Storj storage node inside its own container. 

I just looked up Presearch, and it looks like you can run their node through a Docker container - so this should be okay to do alongside Mysterium. To install the Docker engine on Rasbian, you can [follow this guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/#install-using-the-convenience-script).

Thanks for bringing it up, as I was not aware of this project. Might as well try this myself! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/mnkau7/mysterium_x_storj_labs_a_partnership_to_link_the/gu8bdxr/  Doesn't look like Presearch node is supported on Raspberry Pi yet:

 Hardware Specification

1. Docker image is only for x86 / x64 based CPU's for now.
2. We plan to support ARM / Raspberry Pi in the future, but we're currently focused on fixing bugs and making sure the current platform is robust before additional supported platforms ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/mnkau7/mysterium_x_storj_labs_a_partnership_to_link_the/gu8er2a/  That's not an issue. I'm in the same boat as you - started out with the Mystberry image from Mysterium, then I installed the Docker engine on top of that. So Storj is just running inside its own Docker container (kind of like a virtual machine inside the Raspberry PI), while the myst service and OpenVPN is running outside Docker on the Mystberry OS itself. It has been running a couple of months now without any issues.

I'm also trying to [install an NKN node on the Raspberry PI](https://forum.nkn.org/t/make-your-own-nkm-new-kind-of-miner-out-of-a-raspberry-pi/1599) now, not using a Docker image, but on the OS itself. Trying to get the most out of that little thing, haha. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/mnkau7/mysterium_x_storj_labs_a_partnership_to_link_the/gucl0p8/  Correct!

You can then install the Docker engine as root. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/mnkau7/mysterium_x_storj_labs_a_partnership_to_link_the/guj4kr7/  Haven't really found any other projects where I can run a node on Raspberry Pi yet.

Could you please follow the troubleshooting steps outlined in our blog below, which may involve enabling UPnP or setting up port forwarding.

If you haven't already, we recently launched our [2023 VPN Feedback form](https://mystvpn.net/feedback), we appreciate any further input and will read every response.Hey, u/jspring86, we've recently decided to limit the number of available servers to 1000 per country in Mysterium Dark. This may be why some of your previously used servers are not discoverable. 

From our perspective, this decision was made:

1) To enhance the experience for genuine, non-commercial users.  
2) Provide additional security against IP quality degradation for MystNodes providers.

From our use-data of Mysterium Dark so far, we believe that currently limiting each region's nodes to a randomized pool of 1000 should be more than sufficient for 99% of users and protect against exploits.

We feel this change is best for the overall health of the Mysterium ecosystem, hope this helps!Sorry, our Black Friday sale has now ended.

1. The Mysterium VPN team operates as a different project and team, and their focus is to scale their commercial-grade apps and generate revenue like any other business. This is to ensure the permanent viability of the whole project without reliance on external funding sources.

2. Both Robertas and Jaro are still active supporters of the original Mysterium project and other than being advisors, they contribute to and collaborate on specific areas. They are just not public-facing facing :) Btw, Jaro is not actually a founder, just an early team member.

3. We believe we’re very competitive against bigger players like NordVPN, not just in terms of pricing but in the value you are receiving. We’re much more affordable and flexible, PLUS we also have the greatest number of countries available to connect to - over 130 - more than any other VPN provider (that we know of…). We want users to have a truly global internet experience so we’ll keep adding more locations wherever we can.

4. We have a core team of 8 and a larger number of supporting engineers and contributors.

5. Sorry to hear this - maybe this is an issue with your firewall, and a change in your network setup may help. Try other nodes including data centre nodes (those without an “R” next to the node ID).

Savannahu/allrok These questions and suggestions can be asked directly to the MystNodes team - I am not part of that project so cannot help with a reply I’m afraid! But if you have any questions relating specifically to Mysterium VPN, please feel free to ask - FurkanHey u/Lost_Combination9465!  
  
We don’t have any plans at the moment to provide free data to new users, but if you’re interested in trying out the platform to make up your mind before paying anything, you can always try our 7-day free trial on our mobile platforms.   
  
We don’t collect logs, and in terms of the anonymous part, by switching your IP address with another, you anonymise your identity. But still, a VPN is just one way to enhance your anonymity online and is not bullet-proof.  

SavannahHey u/nctr thanks for your questions!  
  
\- **any upcoming partnerships with other VPNs to sell them bandwidth?**  
B2B sales is not currently a focus of the Mysterium VPN team. We’re prioritizing our global userbase and providing them with the best user experience and support.  
  
**- Is currently the number of nodes or the numbers of bandwidth users (internal or from external partners?) the bottleneck? What are you doing to make it less of a bottleneck?**  
I’m unsure what you mean by bottleneck - right now Mysterium VPN team is utilizing a large number of residential IPs from Mysterium’s node network, with more locations and residential IPs than our top competitors combined. So now we just need to spread awareness of these new VPN apps and show the world what a great enhancement it is to our lives ;)   
  
**- There used to be a partnership with the Sentinel DVPN, as in allow users to use each others nodes. Is this still planned?**  
Mysterium Network collaborated with Sentinel back in the day to form the dVPN Alliance. Sentinel has since pivoted to a new network (Cosmos) while the original Mysterium Dark app uses Polygon to facilitate its P2P transactions. Something for the MystNodes team to consider in future.  
  
\- **Any plan for whitelabel VPNs? As in I create my own website, design and possibly GUI for my VPN company, but pay mysterium in the backend to be able to use their servers?** Possibly with a generic GUI that can simply be rebranded to my own brand.  
  
We use the open-source Mysterium protocol so in theory you could also create your own VPN app using a direct integration of Mysterium Node (check out their GitHub).  
  
But our team may consider white labeling our VPN 2.0 app in the future.

SavannahHey there u/epsilonion-original!  
  
Thanks for bringing up your concerns about Mysterium VPN 2.0. Let's dive into some of your points.  
  
We have a solid QA system in place as we test every release before launching. Yet, unfortunately, bugs slip through the cracks given the device/network variety and we’d love to get your support to detect and squash them.  
  
We had our initial beta testing phases concluded a while ago before we publicly launched our applications. We’ll keep posting any new beta testing opportunities most likely before big feature releases.  
  
On Mysterium VPN 2.0, your assigned IP address refreshes at every connection and you can also manually refresh the IP address in case of any issue with your current IP address.  
  
Thanks a lot for your support and please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any feedback, complaints or suggestions over our Discord channel!

\- Furkanu/SoulReaver-SS Thanks for sharing your points here - we can pass this onto the MystNodes team as we’re not involved in node-related product development or operations. You can also share your concerns with their team directly via their community channels and support team - FurkanHi there, u/holi_thi!

Well, I won’t be able to give you all the technical details here, but I can give a general idea. Unlike Mysterium Dark, Mysterium VPN utilizes a simpler login with magic links so the users will not have any problems losing access to their Mysterium VPN account. On the connection side, we have a brand new system allowing us to handle the connections to nodes and their management, without overburdening the client applications. The node infrastructure allows node owners to share their connection with us and get paid per the usage of their network. Lastly, our client applications (iOS, MacOS, Android and Windows) are all built using Flutter framework. We had to customize the Wireguard library as a Flutter version didn’t exist.

\- FurkanHey u/LaroTayoGaming \- can you elaborate on your question further please? If it's regarding a premium gaming service for MysteriumVPN, this is something that is being considered currently :) 

FurkanHey u/rieljanry! With the new 2.0 apps, we wanted to give superior and stable connections. So whenever you switch on the VPN, our automated algorithm automatically connects you to the fastest, most stable and most suitable server available in the network. If you like that particular IP and find it suits your needs (for streaming for example), then that IP will be saved for you so you will be reconnected again in future.   
  
If you still want the option to choose a specific IP, you can always use the legacy Mysterium Dark app, where you can select from a global menu. This app is also pay-as-you-go. Keep in mind it’s not available for iOS.

FurkanHey u/residentfinancial828, We’ve completed the development of simultaneous connections, which will support up to 6 connections at the same time. Our QA team is currently testing this feature to ensure there are no issues. Our plan is to roll out this feature to all users within one to three weeks.

FurkanHey u/Throwaway_For_Xmas:

Firstly, we recommend you only use a VPN to connect to services and platforms you already subscribe to and/or pay for, and not violate the terms of any platform.   
  
If you are travelling and want to connect to your streaming services back home, or want to stream at home with more privacy and security, then you're better off using a residential IP VPN like Mysterium. In theory, residential IPs should not be detectable by streaming services as these connections appear like real-world users. Most bigger VPN providers connect you to datacenter IPs which are flagged by streaming services. 

SavannahMysterium VPN has a unique edge over regular VPNs like Nord and Cyberghost. We give you exclusive access to the largest network of genuine residential IP addresses, just like the ones you have on your mobile and at home.   
So you get reliable connections that appear like real-world users. This is very helpful when you are travelling and need to access certain websites and apps that might be blocked in different countries. Using a residential VPN means you can easily access your messaging apps, social media, subscription accounts, shows and sports matches no matter where you are in the world.  
  
For context - your average VPN service typically connects you to centralized data centre servers, which often have built-in third-party trackers and shady logging practices. They’re also routinely flagged by popular streaming services, as they are easily identified as data centre commercial IPs. Residential IPs are far more stable, high-quality connections that are harder to detect and block.   
  
On top of that, we support nodes in more than 135 countries, a number that’s higher than almost any competitor in the market and we’re working to improve this even further.   
  
Lastly, one of our key focuses in our new applications is simplicity. We want to get you connected as soon as possible, without worrying about any details :)   
  
FurkanHey u/Euphoric-Brick6291! You would be correct.   


Please note these Finnish Node earnings are a small glitch in our database, and **does not have any impact on other user earnings** in any way. Expect this bug to be removed shortly and the leaderboard to be updated accordingly.  


Apologies for the inconvenience, and thanks for doing your due diligence 👍Hey u/F4OST, to clarify MYST coin is 100% essential to access services from Mysterium Network.

Mysterium Network collaborated with Sentinel back in the day to form the dVPN Alliance. Sentinel has since pivoted to a new network (Cosmos) while the original Mysterium Dark app uses Polygon to facilitate its P2P transactions. Something for the MystNodes team to consider in future.  
  
\- **Any plan for whitelabel VPNs? As in I create my own website, design and possibly GUI for my VPN company, but pay mysterium in the backend to be able to use their servers?** Possibly with a generic GUI that can simply be rebranded to my own brand.  
  
We use the open-source Mysterium protocol so in theory you could also create your own VPN app using a direct integration of Mysterium Node (check out their GitHub).  
  
But our team may consider white labeling our VPN 2.0 app in the future.

Savannah ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jxelecz/  Hey there u/epsilonion-original!  
  
Thanks for bringing up your concerns about Mysterium VPN 2.0. Let's dive into some of your points.  
  
We have a solid QA system in place as we test every release before launching. Yet, unfortunately, bugs slip through the cracks given the device/network variety and we’d love to get your support to detect and squash them.  
  
We had our initial beta testing phases concluded a while ago before we publicly launched our applications. We’ll keep posting any new beta testing opportunities most likely before big feature releases.  
  
On Mysterium VPN 2.0, your assigned IP address refreshes at every connection and you can also manually refresh the IP address in case of any issue with your current IP address.  
  
Thanks a lot for your support and please do not hesitate to reach out to us if you have any feedback, complaints or suggestions over our Discord channel!

\- Furkan ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jxej34r/  u/SoulReaver-SS Thanks for sharing your points here - we can pass this onto the MystNodes team as we’re not involved in node-related product development or operations. You can also share your concerns with their team directly via their community channels and support team - Furkan ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jxehgyk/  Hi there, u/holi_thi!

Well, I won’t be able to give you all the technical details here, but I can give a general idea. Unlike Mysterium Dark, Mysterium VPN utilizes a simpler login with magic links so the users will not have any problems losing access to their Mysterium VPN account. On the connection side, we have a brand new system allowing us to handle the connections to nodes and their management, without overburdening the client applications. The node infrastructure allows node owners to share their connection with us and get paid per the usage of their network. Lastly, our client applications (iOS, MacOS, Android and Windows) are all built using Flutter framework. We had to customize the Wireguard library as a Flutter version didn’t exist.

\- Furkan ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jxei6ja/  Hey u/LaroTayoGaming \- can you elaborate on your question further please? If it's regarding a premium gaming service for MysteriumVPN, this is something that is being considered currently :) 

Furkan ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jxeks53/  Hey u/rieljanry! With the new 2.0 apps, we wanted to give superior and stable connections. So whenever you switch on the VPN, our automated algorithm automatically connects you to the fastest, most stable and most suitable server available in the network. If you like that particular IP and find it suits your needs (for streaming for example), then that IP will be saved for you so you will be reconnected again in future.   
  
If you still want the option to choose a specific IP, you can always use the legacy Mysterium Dark app, where you can select from a global menu. This app is also pay-as-you-go. Keep in mind it’s not available for iOS.

Furkan ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jxene4e/  Hey u/residentfinancial828, We’ve completed the development of simultaneous connections, which will support up to 6 connections at the same time. Our QA team is currently testing this feature to ensure there are no issues. Our plan is to roll out this feature to all users within one to three weeks.

Furkan ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jxeogtw/  Hey u/Throwaway_For_Xmas:

Firstly, we recommend you only use a VPN to connect to services and platforms you already subscribe to and/or pay for, and not violate the terms of any platform.   
  
If you are travelling and want to connect to your streaming services back home, or want to stream at home with more privacy and security, then you're better off using a residential IP VPN like Mysterium. In theory, residential IPs should not be detectable by streaming services as these connections appear like real-world users. Most bigger VPN providers connect you to datacenter IPs which are flagged by streaming services. 

Savannah ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jxeoufg/  Mysterium VPN has a unique edge over regular VPNs like Nord and Cyberghost. We give you exclusive access to the largest network of genuine residential IP addresses, just like the ones you have on your mobile and at home.   
So you get reliable connections that appear like real-world users. This is very helpful when you are travelling and need to access certain websites and apps that might be blocked in different countries. Using a residential VPN means you can easily access your messaging apps, social media, subscription accounts, shows and sports matches no matter where you are in the world.  
  
For context - your average VPN service typically connects you to centralized data centre servers, which often have built-in third-party trackers and shady logging practices. They’re also routinely flagged by popular streaming services, as they are easily identified as data centre commercial IPs. Residential IPs are far more stable, high-quality connections that are harder to detect and block.   
  
On top of that, we support nodes in more than 135 countries, a number that’s higher than almost any competitor in the market and we’re working to improve this even further.   
  
Lastly, one of our key focuses in our new applications is simplicity. We want to get you connected as soon as possible, without worrying about any details :)   
  
Furkan ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15xt0un/ama_meet_the_future_of_vpn_were_savannah_and/jxeons5/  Hey u/Euphoric-Brick6291! You would be correct.   


Please note these Finnish Node earnings are a small glitch in our database, and **does not have any impact on other user earnings** in any way. Expect this bug to be removed shortly and the leaderboard to be updated accordingly.  


Apologies for the inconvenience, and thanks for doing your due diligence 👍 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/15ohjbn/an_enigma_on_the_leaderboard_node_generating_1052/jwardej/  Hey u/F4OST, to clarify MYST coin is 100% essential to access services from Mysterium Network. Even if clients accept fiat, under the hood, they will have to convert it to MYST tokens to use MYST Nodes in their clients. Hope this helps to clear things up, please let us know if you have any further questions :)

Please note [MysteriumVPN has 500k+ downloads](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=network.mysterium.vpn&hl=en&gl=US) on the Google Play store and we've been going since 2017! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/13w4y12/mysterium_on_virus_total_says_its_aware/jmd9df2/  Hi u/iexistwhoa, are you referencing the [Mysterium VPN](https://mysteriumvpn.com) app? If so, please make sure you download the latest version [here](https://mysteriumvpn.com). This should fix your problems with updating. Thanks for sharing, please let us know if this solves your issue and if you have any other questions 🙌 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1132iua/mysterium_updating_forever/j8nmxu6/  Hi u/lib3rty, staking $MYST tokens on IQ Protocol is risk-free as it does not require any upfront collateral like most DeFi protocols.

Additionally, staking $MYST is also 100% non-inflationary by design as any yields are generated **only by actual network usage** and not from artificial inflation (due to this, we are unable to specify a percentage APY for yields.)

I hope this information helps, you can also find further details located in our docs here: [https://docs.mysterium.network/for-node-runners/staking-your-myst-tokens](https://docs.mysterium.network/for-node-runners/staking-your-myst-tokens)

Please let me know if you have any other questions, thanks! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10zqwpj/risks_of_staking_on_iq_protocols/j8dssss/  u/Visible_Chance5712, correct the staking process is still in beta as we seek to roll out our new tokenomics. Earnings from staking $MYST also automatically compound in IQ protocol (unless you choose to withdraw.) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10zqwpj/risks_of_staking_on_iq_protocols/j8i08zd/  Hi, u/visible_chance5712 To clarify, **rented MYST** is for those who wish to access Network services from Mysterium Network (for example, b2b clients, third-party apps etc.) You don't have to do this to access [MysteriumVPN.com](https://MysteriumVPN.com), you can just transact directly with your $MYST polygon wallet or our payment processors.  


**Staking rewards** that each participant receives will fluctuate based on the size of the pool and network activity. The more users, the more rewards can be earned by exit nodes and token delegators. Because of this, it's very hard to calculate APR for anything other than a short period of time, that's why we currently have not included an APR metric on the dashboard.   


Other users have made their own short-term calculations which they are free to share, but due to the above reasons, we are unable to comment on APY of yield rewards.   


Hope this is helpful, let us know if you have any further questions. Thanks! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10zqwpj/risks_of_staking_on_iq_protocols/j8nhaka/  u/tech686 \- Anyone can take part, even total beginners!

The type of device/O.S does not matter as long as everything is functioning correctly (which as you have already received traffic, should be fine.)  


$MYST node traffic is based on location, internet quality (bandwith, latency, uptime) and consumer demand for your region. To note, residential nodes have a higher demand than Data centre-based providers.   


$MYST pricing is dynamic and is calculated using this formula:   
Base Price x Load Coefficient  
Load coefficient = active sessions / active providers in the region  


I hope this information helps! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wedjiy/leaderboard_1_earned_145us_in_the_last_month/io9w8wj/  Hey u/hedsteel, great to have you here and thanks for your question.

**BUT** like every other subreddit we do (very rarely!) remove content to keep the discussion on the **topic of the thread**. As an example, you have made over a dozen comments/posts in r/mysteriumnetwork and I believe just 2 were moderated by the team for being off-topic.

Regarding your time node-running with us, we would like to apologise if your expectations were not met but kindly remind you that since our recent switch to Mainnet, node rewards are tied to your setup (location, uptime etc) and also **money into the network**. 

The more **money into the Mysterium network means the more money paid to nodes**. 

Many of our node-runners support the network for our **long-term objectives and believe the $MYST token / Node earnings will grow as our B2B and Consumer-facing products gain momentum**. Even though Mysterium is still in alpha, there are lots of users reporting highly profitable nodes as seen [here](https://mystnodes.com/).

As an example of our growth initiatives, we recently launched the [$3M RnD fund called NectoLabs](https://www.nectolabs.io/) to attract **world-class product builders and traffic** into the Mysterium Network. We're aiming for Mysterium to be larger than centralized privacy offerings and also offer our supporters exposure to unique revenue streams that blockchain technology facilitates.

LifeHappenzEvryMomnt,"This right here.You bit someone?This infuriates me as well. Yesterday there was a different one also blaming a vet for a dying dog. The dog was terminal when they got to the vet. People don’t seem to understand.  They’re angry at the loss and you guys become the target of that anger. And I’m sorry because they should behave like adults, bring it to the person they blame and talk it out. 

Best to everyone in this profession. You are valued by most of your clients in real life.Not a vet but I’m a scientist and help on the chicken subs. I once went through and analyzed the only scientific paper on the use of DE for preventing fowl mites. I explained to the person why the paper doesn’t quite say what he thinks. That environmental use is a secondary finding. Used some statistics to extrapolate the researchers findings. Pointed out the paper is not cited by others, the PI himself never followed up. 

I was in a mood.

This is what he said, “Well me and everyone I know uses it and it works.”

You cannot argue with this kind of willful ignorance.Happy cake day!Wear a mask?? Are you Satan?Like, are you serious? Really? I agree with explaining she can split the ashes or send it back to the crematorium to do it. It’s really not your job.It depends on whether you are going into small animal or large animal practice.That’s tougher then. And more expensive. Your competition is corporations who can staff clinics and buy equipment that’s harder for a single practitioner to afford. 

But it’s like real estate and can depend on your location and your specialty. Right now we have many vets but the only vet who will see exotics is at least 20 miles away. And I’m seeing more and more people willing to pay a vet to see and dx their pet chickens for example. We have a great relationship with our horse vet and he saw one of our chickens but he was winging it (groan). 

In southern CA we were bereft when the only canine dental specialist in the area retired. 

These are just some thoughts and I’m not a vet, just a customer. It’s also hard to predict what the market will look like many years from now.My vet has a memorial tattoo of her horse on her wrist. You can’t miss it. I love it because it shows she cares. I think it’s a positive thing.

Consider provided she has the money, certainly she could go and you could handle those things at home until you could join her later?

Chambers are a whole different thing.I have worked ER full time since 1998 and part time and relief at various GP. I have not seen manual differentials done except in one or cases. Honestly because I was there to do them versus waiting for the sent out results. 

When I started in GP (mostly we saw dinosaurs) a large majority of the lab work was sent out. It has become the norm now to have in house diagnostics but routine annual panels are still sent out.In ER we did them on every patient. I have a technician friend who worked at Antech. She was expected to process 15-20 manual differentials per hour. I wish I could have that speed and be confident in my results. 

I don't miss manual WBC counts in ye olden days before there was an in-house machine.The answer depends somewhat on where you are located.

maighdeannmhara,"rDVM here.

I've had clients who went on their own and said they were transferred. Or clients who have called with something that is obviously an emergency on a Friday 10 minutes before close, and we send them elsewhere directly so they say they were transferred when we haven't physically seen the pet in 2 years. I've had clients who I know were given a ballpark estimate and go anyway only to decline everything due to cost because maybe they mulled it over on the car ride over. I recently sent a client to Hospital Y because Hospital X said they weren't taking transfers, and she showed up at Hospital X anyway, so Hospital X got mad at us. 

The closest ER/specialty hospital to us will only book appointments for clients if we call in a referral first, and they also strongly encourage us to call for ER as well. So we do. We like them and want to have good working relationships.

But they only want doctors calling, not techs, even though most of these calls could easily be handled by techs. I don't know how many times I've sat on hold waiting and how many times I've had to call repeatedly because the specialty scheduling person wasn't available. For emergencies, I also don't expect ER docs to be ready and available to talk on the phone immediately because they have a million more important things to do than talk on the phone. And when we have issues getting through, clients get upset and sometimes decide to just go.

As for cost, there are 4-5 referral options near me, and I can't memorize prices for everything for everyone. Inflation hasn't done us any favors, with how many times prices have changed. When I get that info during a call, I pass it along to the client. Whether they actually listen is out of my control.

It's hard on both ends of the relationship. Cut us all some slack and show a little grace for your colleagues who are trying their best.We don't have a vet school enrollment or vet school shortage problem. We have retention and distribution problems. 

Rural areas lack services because working there is not desirable and sometimes not even profitable or sustainable. The work is physically demanding. On call and after hours work are required because if you're literally the only shop in town, you're responsible for providing 24/7/365 care to your patients. Anecdotally, the only people who work in rural practices and stay there long term are people who grew up there and have other ties and other reasons to be there.

What I mean by the retention problem is that many full timers end up leaving the field or dropping down to part time hours. It happens for a lot of different reasons, some related to the field and some related to wider phenomena.

None of these things - literally zero of them - can be fixed by simply opening new schools. Mark Cushing is a vulture, and everyone else is either fooling themselves or taking the opportunity to cash in, taking advantage of people who want to become vets and who will pay $55k+ per year in tuition to some slapdash rickety-ass school to get there. It's gross and a disgrace to the profession.Looking at the newer schools, Lincoln Memorial University is $52k per year in tuition alone. University of Arizona is $47k. Texas Tech is ""cheap"" at $33k for out of state and $22k for in state. It's the only one I can think of that has state support.

So say you're a bright eyed, bushy tailed student, and you get into one of these new schools. Let's pretend you're lucky and have family pay all of your living expenses and everything other than tuition. Or maybe you had savings to cover that. You graduate with $200k minimum in student loan debt, ignoring the interest that accumulates while you're in school.

Rural jobs are long hours, weekends, holidays, and pay is lower. How are you going to manage your massive debt load from your expensive school by providing services in an area where you make way less money for working way more hours? 

A lot of people start off in this career intending to do large animal, equine, or mixed practice, but the financial realities drive a significant number of those vets into small animal practice in suburban and urban environments. Adding more schools doesn't change that at all.I think we're more likely to ignore studies that go against our personal experiences, and with metronidazole, it's such a commonly used medication that we all have a lot of experience with it. And we all seem to think it really works. As a GP, I've only seen a handful of blocked cats over 3 years, so I don't have any strong feelings or preferences with prazosin or any other aspects of management. So it's easy to change what I do based on new studies. But I see multiple cases of diarrhea just about every week of the year, so it's really easy to build up anecdata and blind spots.

I try to avoid metro for the most part. I've had good results with fiber supplementation and have gone that route with my own dogs with success. There are some cases where I reach for metro or tylosin if bland diet + fiber + probiotics fails. I also have a handful of clients who are used to getting it every time, so I cave in. And I have one worked up through internal med who is on it chronically. But overall, the evidence for antibiotics causing dysbiosis and predisposing to long term problems is very compelling, and it's all over the human lit as well. So I'm convinced overall.

I'm also wondering about all of these various doodle breeds who seem predisposed to chronic enteropathy. I've had a few who got metro as puppies and have had non-stop issues since. Of course it's impossible to tell if their issues were exacerbated by metro or if they were already going to have exactly the same problems and that's *why* they got metro so early in life in the first place. Still, I really, really try to avoid metro and tylosin in dogs who haven't reached full maturity.At my current job, prescriptions and refills are a slightly lower %, and heartworm/flea tick is 11%. Any diets (we only carry 2) and OTC products like medicated shampoos, wipes, probiotics are not included. Each hospital is different.I've worked mostly with Idexx machines, but my new place has Abaxis. I'm not impressed. The image quality and resolution for the urinalysis machine is terrible compared to the Idexx Sedivue. No big issues with the hematology or chem machine except for it being annoying to run and the print out being the little strips of paper vs the nicer Idexx print outs. The rotor thingies suck. I've had situations where I'm waiting and waiting for T4 results and then my tech tells me it didn't work and they have to run it again because of air in the rotor or whatever. And I don't like that I can't check just ALT or any of the individual slides. 

Our practice owner hated Idexx customer service and is very loyal to Antech and Zoetis, but I miss my Idexx machines.

As for general send out lab stuff, I don't have any complaints with Antech vs Idexx, though I rarely miss having quantitative proBNP.I personally have never seen it, but I don't see why it couldn't happen. I think the biggest sticking point would be that other associates would be giving up these surgery cases to the surgery doctor. You can't get a pet to surgery if you don't have them in for an appointment first, so as someone who likes surgery and likes appointments, I'd be very irritated if I ""lost"" a lot of my cases to someone who didn't want to put the work in to develop the surgical caseload themselves. But I've worked with a bunch of vets who don't do much surgery or any at all, and they were happy to pass on those cases to someone else, so if you have the right mix of people, there's no reason why it can't work.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Since you’re the Tech manager, where else do you go with a problem besides the next step up the ladder?I’m a vet. My 18 month old son went to the ER many years ago. He needed a catheter and they couldn’t get one in. Finally they called over the MD to try for a jug cath.  I asked if I could hold my son as I was a veterinarian.  They let me, to my amazement. I had hands and legs wrapped up and neck extended.  No, the doc couldn’t get the jug cath in that big old non-hairy protruding vein so they eventually got a pediatric nurse to get in a saphenous in his foot. Very interesting experience, and the staff at the ER were all great.Talk to the Medical Director and OM if corporate. If private, talk to the veterinary owner. This is creating a hostile work environment for you and isn’t ok. They need to teach the staff how to act professionally. But, as many have said already, s**t rolls downhill and this probably started at the top, either through intention or inaction.I worked as a groom on a race track one summer before vet school. I asked the equine vet on the track if I could shadow him for a little bit and he let me. Just ask. Worse that happens is that they say no.  I wouldn’t do LinkedIn.  Doubt you’d get a reply. Face to face is best if possible, at this stage of where you are.Decades ago I went to Miami for a week during a vet school summer and helped out at a bird quarantine center.  It was a huge warehouse with cages of wild caught parrots, budgies, macaws, etc stacked on each other. Every morning we’d check the cages and take out the sick birds and they’d go to the clinic in the warehouse.  One morning we tube fed over 30 sick parrots and macaws.  I think they also necropsied the birds. Being a vet for that type facility might be a step Along your non-traditional pathway.I would think there are a lot of veterinary clinics around you looking for a full time associate. In our area everyone is looking (CA).Get a job where they agree to mentor you. That might mean the mentor vet sees fewer cases per day while you start building up your experience and communication skills. You’d probably want to start the case, then go talk to your mentor. We’re looking to hire someone, and if a new grad, that’s how I’ll set it up. You’d be pretty good in a few months to not need much help. And, there are books- with flow charts, explanations, and so on.  For surgery the mentoring would be a little different depending on who has the time. We’re planning to hire a vet I know who is partially retired to do that.It’s wrong that you aren’t getting paid. You can get a job for a decent salary. I’d quit and go find a paying job. You’ll get experience AND get paid.At what age should I spay/neuter my dog. 
My dog hardly ever goes outside, so he doesn’t need heartworm preventative. 
What’s the best dry food to feed my pet, and it cleans their teeth, right?Sometimes the client talks too much, and you can waste valuable time. Controlling the narrative of the history, without squashing it, is a useful skill to develop. For example, I might interrupt, and apologize for doing so, then say I just need to get a better overview of Fluffy’s vomiting and diarrhea.  Did the diarrhea start with the vomiting 3 weeks ago, and roughly how many times per day or week.  That type of thing. 

As you get better at asking the right questions, as well as listening to the client, you’ll get a better history which can help you out with non-routine cases.  We’ve built our practice on listening to clients, and have 30-45 min appointments.  But I often don’t need all that time and will allow an urgent care to take part of a slot.I check ears with otoscope for all routine exams. Just make it a habit and it’ll get easier. Like riding a bike.We aren’t slow. Clients want some basic respect. Letting them know the ballpark cost can let them choose to see you or go.  We’ve always given out this type of estimate from the front desk.Vet here. I suspect the questions were beyond what you would or should be expected to know or to answer, and it’s ok to say that a vet should answer the questions and you’ll leave a message. I, the vet, would call the (scared) client and quickly field some questions and have them make app’t. My notes would say “first seizure, disc. rules outs, set up exam. Told O to go to EC if more seizures or does not want to wait for app’t”.As a new grad just get some general medicine and surgery experience first. Then in 5 years, if you’re still burnt out of the profession (not just being a student) you’ll have a good enough skill and knowledge base to do relief, house calls or whatever.It may not be the profession. It might be depression or another medical issue. I’d take a week off to re-evaluate things, maybe see a counselor (I’m a vet).You’ll do fine. Many vets are looking for associates. Be clear what you are looking for. Don’t sign a contract without having it reviewed. Too many times vets get stuck in a poor fit because of the contract they signed.Salaries have risen a ton in the past 3 years. I used to try to dissuade young people from being vets, but currently, the bennies and income is good. Of course, it all depends on your vet school debts, so calculate an average expected debt load and crunch your numbers on payback amounts.I worked in NYC as a vet a long time ago. Depending on where you live you’d want to contact the practices nearby. No need to commute an hour. Salary in NYC should be comparable to CA ( I’m in CA now).I did an AMC internship in NY and that really really helped me. Many corporate (maybe non-corporate too) will mentor new grads. Heck, at my practice I have experienced relief vets who can only see 6 cases a day- without mentoring. I’d much rather take a new grad and mentor their 6 cases a day as I know they’ll just get better and better.You’d go in and start the case. Then come out and ask your mentor how to proceed. Then back to the client. You’d get better and better with each case. Surgery would be mentor scrubbed in to help you initially. No “dive into the deep end” stuff.Female GP, 2 DVM’s, CA, many years out, corp.  $130k plus 21% prod. 32 hours/wk. No on call. 5k CE, 6 wks PTO, 4 sick days, 5k matching 401k.I have a feeling they just want you to have skin in the game to suck you dry. At 5% “ownership” you can’t make any decisions. There are a lot of 1-2 doctor practices on the market or soon to be, with few corporate buyers for even 1 million grossing small clinics. If you really want to be an owner, you should be able to pick and choose right now, and down the road.I also once bit someone in a “situation” and got arrested. Fortunately for me the police were very helpful under the circumstances and called it something minor rather than an assault. And said the other person had done the same thing to me. We both declined to press charges and I went to vet school the next year. I’d get a lawyer for this.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment was written by a veterinarian, but it also contains information and advice from a medical doctor perspective.

catanddogtor,"GPA is certainly important for some specialties, but the other method to land an internship/residency is networking. But it depends on the specialty of course.

I've always been big on work life balance and cruised through vet school with a B average. In my fourth year, I did rotations at locations where I wanted to do an internship and did my best to make a really good impression on the doctors there and was subsequently selected through the match at one of those clinics. During my rotating internship, I did an externship at the clinic where I wanted to do my residency and made a good impression there as well, and they took me on as a resident outside the match. (Making a good impression basically meant looking into cases ahead of time and being very prepared, knowing about the diseases and medications, jumping in to help as much as possible etc). And now I'm a boarded specialist. Meanwhile, one of my intern-mates was never accepted for residency despite a very high vet school gpa because she was.. well, very awkward.Also, I went to lots of office hours for a couple different professors, tried very hard to excel on their fourth year rotations (when they occurred before the match) and then asked them for LORs.I'm not too sure about what grades people are looking for. My resident mate and I both just networked our way into residency outside the match. For dermatology, a good number of the residency positions are outside the match, so you have a couple different avenues for residency. Higher grades are generally helpful for the match, networking is very helpful in or outside the match. Doing a derm internship can make a big difference, because derm is a small world and you can really meet people and learn a lot that way. NAVDF is a good place to network too.","Veterinarian.

Less-Ebb-7668,"This is disrespectful and is a form of insubordination. I defiantly would talk with them and also let them know you will be talking to superiors about the issue.You sound similar to me… since I was 8 years old it’s something I’ve always wanted to do. I HATED HIGH SCHOOL! In a class of 250 students I was ranked 198 with a 2.32 GPA. I graduated in 2006…

4 years later I started at a technical college and graduated with an Associate’s Degree in 2013. I moved on and went for my Bachelor’s in Business Administration, in the meantime I spent time doing various other jobs including insurance for 4 years. Learned alot but still didn’t feel at home with what I was doing. I graduated in 2022 with my Bachelor’s in Business Administration. 

Just over 3/4 the way through the Business Administration degree, I had to enroll in a  freshman Biology course for the distance education degree I was working on. That course led me to take microbiology. I then signed up for Gen Chemistry to prove to myself I could do it. (I basically failed my Chem class in HS) That Gen Chem class ended with an A and I took the 2nd half of the year course that Spring, and then the professor convinced me to take the years worth of Organic Chemistry. You guessed it, I did very well. After I graduated in the Spring of 2022 with my BS in Business Administration, I enrolled in Spring of 2023 at the college I took 3/4 of my science courses with a Biology major with emphasis in Animal Biology & Pre-Veterinary medicine. I had finished all but two classes and applied my first Cycle in 2022 with the VMCAS. I was rejected from every Veterinary school I applied too. 

If any of them offer file reviews DO THE REVIEW! I took the two offers for the file review… did what they told me I should do for the Summer of 2023. I reapplied on the VMCAS cycle for the Fall 2024 Veterinary School admissions. I applied to 7 schools. Waitlisted at 3 - had interviews at 3, outright rejected from two, and was accepted to two schools. I am choosing UW-Madison to go too. On top of that I am graduating this Spring 2024 with another two Bachelor’s Degrees. 

What I am saying is being persistent, resilient and learning through the process is HUGE! Do what your gut is telling you. I wish I did sooner.

I should add that I have major self doubt, self confidence and I have a hard time believing in myself. I’m always asking if I really can do it. Even now with me being accepted I’m worried I won’t make it through Veterinary College. 

I turned 36 this year…

goddessofPtown,"You need to really learn medicine first (in the really world,  not school). I do in- home euthanasias and there are times where there have been (flagrant) misdiagnoses and other situations which changed the outcome for that pet. Plus you need to have experience in dealing with clients,  sometimes at their worst. Plus, in my experience,  not all euthanasias are 'by the book'. Sometimes I have to work with severely debilitated patients. You need experience to deal with that.

sierrakurian,"I do!! Give me 2 years 🙋🏽‍♀️ looks like they would accept me from the US due to the shortage. I’m interested in equine. Do you feel like it’s mostly small animal that they need?My recommendation is although all the animal stuff and patient care is of course the most fun part, try to appreciate and put effort into all parts of the job. Whether you’re doing receptionist work or cleaning bathrooms, it’s all important and it’s all an opportunity for staff to see how much of a hard worker you are. Then they will train you and let you do all the fun stuff!! Try to familiarize yourself with where things are so you can grab them in a hurry. Also, making sure you are good with customer service! Taking care of the client will go a long way as well. Good luck you’re going to do great!What does loan repayment mean? Like they pay the full loan amount for you? That sounds lovelyI had a lot of success with YouTube videos!I go grocery shopping and make a big pot of something on Sunday and try to make that last through the week. I’m definitely tired of eating the same thing but it saves me a lot of time And money. 
This year I really have tried to prioritize making time in my day to exercise. It helps having a dog that requires exercise so I can’t really avoid going. It’s tough, I am by no means in the best shape of my life. Especially right now when it’s dark at 430. But I’ve found that taking that time to exercise makes me better at studying and an overall happier person. It’s often about mentally pushing through the fatigue and coming out on the other side I’m always glad I did it.","Other.

""That incision looks great, I can take those out for you."" 

""No thank you.""

""No thank you."" 

""It'll save you coming back and wasting time later.""

""I don't think that would be a good idea.""

""Why not?""

""Because it's been less than 48 hours and it bled a lot when they removed the mole that was there.""I mean if fowl mites aren't an issue in his area and he and everyone he knows are using DE then it's not really harming anything as long as he wears a mask and moves the birds somewhere when spreading it. I've never had any snakes in the kitchen and I've always had a coffee maker there so I can't say there's a correlation for sure, but it definitely seems like coffee makers prevent snakes from coming in. 

Mind you, if they have a mite infestation and try to treat it just with DE that's another issue.Overnight positions can be difficult to fill. It sounds like they haven't received a lot of push back from you, and unfortunately for some managers the path of least resistance is the one most frequently taken. I live in a place with lots of demand for veterinary professionals, so my first step would be a meeting where I laid out my availability (not overnight) and my second would be updating my resume and looking at other local hospitals with vets who see exotics.","Veterinarian.

But all I want to add is that most techs respected me as a new grad. There were a couple that didn't, and in one case, the situation escalated.

daabilge,"Jobs/pay: yeahhh vet pay is almost always lower. Sorry. Even the residency pay between DVM and MD pathology residencies at the same university tends to be drastically lower..

Residency success: I would look into finding a pathologist to do research with, joining the pathology club, generally getting involved in pathology. Join Davis-Thompson foundation as well! Identify programs you'd be interested in and try to set up externships during your clinical rotations. 

Benefits/raises/promotions: will depend where you end up. There's many different places you can work as a pathologist, ranging from academia to reference labs to contract research to specialty diagnostic centers to state diagnostic labs. 

In office vs work from home: again, varies, but generally pathology is a specialty that's more amenable towards work from home with the rise of digital slides and whole slide imaging systems. If you end up somewhere that doesn't have a slide scanner or where you have a necropsy caseload you might be working in-office more, vs like a reference lab like Idexx might have you mostly work from home.Yeah I send a written summary of what's going on with the owner and then email the full record to the ER. I'll also call the ER to give them a heads up, and if they provide me with an estimate, I give that to the client. I don't guesstimate how much the ER will charge if they don't, though, that seems to make clients angrier if I underestimate.

If it's one of those where ER is recommended but the client is unwilling but MIGHT go to ER I usually try to include a bit of extra info and basically that case summary and relevant diagnostic results in their discharge notes in case they do decide to go to ER.I've absolutely taken off claws when they're problematic - I had a polydactyl/syndactyl where the syndactyl claw was thick and platelike and growing out sideways like a hammerhead into the sides of the toes next to it. I don't phrase it as declawing - I also don't do declaws unless medically indicated - so I called it what it is, which is a digit amputation. Cat kept the remaining claws, but that one (or technically two that had become one?) needed to go and the cat has a better quality of life for it.I guess to elaborate on what the other commenter said, exotics would typically be where it gets ""fun"". There are standard positions for many of our domestics, and those adapt somewhat well to many of our mammalian exotics, but not always. I think Maders has guidelines for standard imaging on different types of herps, and Quesenbury has them for small mammal.

Often for small mammals, small reptiles, and birds, we do whole body rads. Typically not enough space on the animal to collimate out what you're not interested in anyway. We also may use dental radiographs to image limbs or extremities on tiny patients (I used dental rads on a tree frog to see an humeral fracture, for example) and some places use the mini-ct scanners for small patients since they've come down in price (relatively..)

The small body sizes of many of our bird and reptiles and small mammals has led to all sorts of jigs and doohickeys for imaging them. Often we do end up sedating them to obtain images, but also there's positioning aids that you can tie birds into, we also sometimes ""invent"" things like a little rig I built for imaging turtles that my coworker affectionately calls my panini press. I've also just taped lizards down to a rolled up towel like James Bond with the laser in Goldfinger.. 

I LOVE ultrasound for aquatics. It's so freaking easy. Water is an incredible conduction medium so you just kind of put the fish or frog or salamander in a bag of water, point the probe in its direction, and image away.

And sometimes you really have to get creative in zoo med. For big mammals they often use portable/handheld x-ray units. Columbus zoo has a video of them CT-ing a shark, which I think is Dr Junge's proudest moment. Dude loves his CT.I don't think there's like a discrete subspecialty where you'd train in exclusively large animal oncology, but in a region with a lot of large animal cases you might be able to carve out a niche at a big referral center, like maybe Rood and Riddle would hire a surg onc doctor with a strong equine background, or you could try to go the academic route and work for a university hospital. We had an oncologist at my vet school who would consult on equine cases because her research was on melanomas.I'm a member of a couple professional societies for topics of interest (Reptile and Amphibian medicine, aquatics, and pathology) and I get their journals and CE events. I also am part of two journal clubs, so we scour recent publications for topics of interest and meet up to chat about them. I also teach prevet at a university so I make my students read papers as well.I believe penetrating captive bolt is generally preferred for this sort of use. I'm not a large animal vet but it's what I've used for large fish.Yeah our wildlife officers just use a rifle... safer at a distanceI would message her directly first. I would use specific examples and provide the appropriate information in response to those examples. 

If you feel that the information she's putting out is harmful and outside the scope of her practice, you might also consider reaching out to her states veterinary medical association and/or licensing board since that may technically fall under practicing without a license. Unfortunately, we don't have great title protection for our techs and it's not necessarily illegal to just give bad pet advice, although if she's misrepresenting herself as a medical professional in order to do so, that may cross that line.For wellness, my common questions tend to be along the lines of
- dental prevention/cleaning/does my grade 4 perio actually need a dental cleaning or can I just let them all rot out of his skull
- (when) should I spay/neuter?
- why do we need the vaccines/what are we preventing?
- the food allergy talk, alongside the general allergy talk, because everyone and their mother will tell you their dog is allergic to chicken and corn
- should I be feeding a raw/grain free/whatever the current trendy diet is? What's the best diet?
- obesity/yes your pet is obese/no, your cat should not be spherical
- what's the deal with (disease/pet thing currently in the news)
- why should we run the screening bloodwork/fecal
- general medication compliance (his cough seemed better so I stoped the pimobendan)

And then a handful of common case presentations that I'd be ready to approach and have some differentials for, by species

Dog
- rash/ear infection/other dermy things
- lameness
- cough
- diarrhea
- change in appetite
- inappropriate urination
- vomiting

Cat
- hiding more
- losing weight
- inappropriate urination
- change in appetite
- chronic vomiting
- upper respiratory stuff

**and if you'll be doing exotics**

Small fermenting fuzzies (rabbits, guinea pigs)
- URI
- eye discharge
- Decreased appetite/defecation (most experienced owners will also just tell you stasis, so your job is to fix it and ID the underlying cause)
- drooling/dropping feed/other dental spur things

Other rodents (rats especially)
- chronic RI (and it's almost always mycoplasma, and they almost always infect their whole colony, so good time to have that biosecurity/quarantine talk)
- fur mites
- masses

Ferrets
- Rubber foreign body (young ones)
- adrenal disease (and in young ones, questions about adrenal disease)
- weird diarrheas
- lethargy/seizure/insulinoma
- respiratory

Reptiles
- hasn't eaten in 6 months, now lethargic
- RI
- mouth rot
- Generally poor husbandry (what I mean is, bone up on husbandry and supportive care approaches)

Fish
- Water Quality
- WATER QUALITY
- **WATER QUALITY**Repetition is key - you'll get these drilled into you after having them as cases so I would start out somewhere that offers you time to think about your cases when you're starting out. My first practice unfortunately started me on 20 minute appointments, if I could do it all over again I'd definitely want at least 40. Getting those reps in will help you build confidence in each topic and plan out a speel.. and it's always fine to say ""hey I don't know, I'll find out"" and go read some journals and find your answer.. like for the weird dog respiratory disease, I had a bunch of clients that I sent an email to once I had a chance to read up from trusted sources. I read a lot of journals anyway, largely because I'm trying to get out of GP and into a pathology residency or a research lab and so for every residency I applied to, I read up their universities recent major publications, and likewise for each lab I applied to, I read their entire bibliography.

I tend to be more of a ""lumper"" which helps since your initial diagnostic approach for each differential under each case ""archetype"" is going to be pretty similar.. and most of those are common enough that you'll have plenty of repetition. I also use Blackwell's 5 minute consult and I use Veterinary Partner for handouts on specific diseases. You can do CE for areas you feel weak. Conferences tend to also focus on common diseases more often. 

For the exotics stuff, a mix of externships, firsthand experience, and CE. Lefeber is a good place to start, Miami also hosts a monthly free CE for mostly exotics hematology and clinical pathology topics, and then respective professional societies (WAVMA and ARAV) and their journals and CE. I did a couple lab animal conferences (POLA and CLASS) that helped with rodents, rabbits, and fish. I took a master herpetologist course that helped a lot with husbandry for the reptiles and amphibians.For pathology, depends highly on what you end up doing. Salaries for academia aren't great. Salaries for industry/reference labs tend to be fairly good. Salaries for contract research organizations or private labs tend to be excellent.

A bunch of my pathology professors from vet school would read slides for reference labs on the side since many labs now use digital slides and have a lot of flexibility/operate kind of like digital radiology.And the benefits.. The one I interned at had a gym and water park and full catered dining hall (all included in employee benefits) on site, plus great insurance and some of the best techs I've ever worked with. I'd very much like to go back after I'm boarded.Depends on what type of vet you want to be.. and what you consider travel.

As a GP it may be difficult, especially in a smaller practice. At my first job out of school, I got one and a half days off per week and 2 weeks total vacation per year and had to work out coverage for any vacations (or conferences) with my coworkers, and I would get last pick of vacation dates and conferences because I was the most junior. It may also cut into your travel.. like I had that office call me at my friends wedding to ask about an exotics case because none of the other vets felt comfortable answering, which was rather frustrating.. A classmate of mine is at a larger clinic (corporate, like 10ish doctors) so she has a lot more freedom with time off and travel. 

Meanwhile some specialties have travel cooked into your job - like USDA or other public health/regulatory positions. And, of course, if you're a leader in your specialty you'll get invited to speak at conferences, and between the conference and your employer, someone will often cover some part of your travel expenses (like hotel room or the conference admission). May not be locations you always want to visit - although I'm finally getting to see the national zoo as part of an upcoming conference - but it's still travel even if a good chunk of it will be spent learning/working.

You also have to consider travel expenses with your student debt.The internship requirement is becoming absurd. Even in pathology - which doesn't require an internship - a lot of programs are giving preference to students who have completed an internship, and there's a growing number of pathology specific internships where your duties look suspiciously similar to a resident, but you don't qualify for boards and the pay is somehow even lower.. and they're one year appointments so you have that additional financial barrier of needing to move for just one year of work. They state it's because you'll have additional clinical insight from your internship, but working as a clinician rather than an intern apparently doesn't count for that because you couldn't understand the academic rigor. Working as a clinician full-time while getting a masters apparently doesn't count either. 

And I've noticed - for at least two programs that I'm aware of - the residency director has openly slept with students or residents and still holds that position. 

Although I think the most egregious example I know of was when (and details are left vague to protect identities) a resident discovered that their significant other at another institution had attempted suicide and was punished for taking PTO to go visit their SO in the hospital.Male, relatively recent grad, suburban major Midwestern city, 115k with no production (started at 96k) and I rotate between multiple clinics owned by the same entity with GP, Urgent Care, small mammal exotics, reptile, amphibian, and aquatics. 14 days PTO, $1,200 CE. I also have teaching duties with a local university and do research, altogether make about 150k across my jobs

Eta: I work nine 4-hour shifts (technically they're 5h with 1h per shift for phones/lunch, usually it's four 8-6 days and one half day) per week at the clinics and then teaching/research duties on my half days and weekendsThe passing grade varies from year to year - typically it's around 425-450 which comes out to around 55-60%

Passing grade is based on what's called the Modified Angloff Method for deriving a pass-fail score, so they basically have a group of experts decide what would constitute a passing grade for a minimally competent candidate and then subject it to a whole bunch of discussion to establish a concrete cutoff score based on their expected difficulty.Congrats!

It's a really straightforward interview with fairly classic vet school interview questions. Prepare for the usual sorts of interview questions (there's some really good examples online) and don't panic. They're just trying to find out if you're a good fit for them, and you should also see if they're a good fit for you. Nobody is out to trick you or intentionally ask anything confusing or difficult.

Be yourself, rest up the night before, dress nice and find a space with minimal distractions. Don't be surprised if your interviewers are a bit stoic - they're not supposed to lead you or react in a way that would change your responses. Keep in mind that it is closed file, so your interviewers know absolutely nothing about you going in.

We're all just regular folks just like you, so don't be intimidated. We've all been in your place and know how scary it can be. This is actually my favorite time of year because I get to meet all the new prospective students and hear all about your path to vet med and your goals and dreams.Nobody I know has left the profession entirely, but I had one classmate who left clinical practice to do a home euthanasia service after being harassed and stalked by a client and getting no support from their employer. Another is now a rep for a pharmaceutical company after trying two private practices. Once my contract is up in May, I'll be quitting my current jobs in private practice and teaching and taking a job exclusively in research.You could do aquatic medicine. I'd see if your school has a student chapter of WAVMA. They also offer a pretty good student discount on individual membership and on their conferences. If youre also into amphibians consider ARAV as well.I mean yeah I'd agree the main focus is dog medicine - even cats are often taught as a variant to dogs, although we had a whole semester of equine/ruminant anatomy - but from what I've seen a lot of vet schools are pretty ""customizable"" although usually that means you have to set that opportunity up yourself. We had tracks for large animals, small animal, mixed, and equine and then you could also ""build your own""

I was lucky enough to go to a school that had a pretty solid aquatics foundation, we had a class taught by a CertAqV and an active WAVMA chapter that did a lot of wetlabs so I got a good chunk of my credit for the CertAqV done while in school. My school didn't do any live exotics on clinics so I had to do all external rotations and set them up myself. I had classmates doing aquatics who did summer internships with zoos or aquariums or with aquaculture producers. I'm more into toxicologic pathology so I did lab animal stuff with our zebrafish colonies.Ohio State - certainly still not perfect but they did at least have electives in exotics (which have gotten better since it's now Dr. Nick Jew from Medvet teaching the reptile/amphibian classes and Dr. Oglesbee teaching rabbits and avian medicine) and aquatics (last I heard, it was Dr. Flint and Dr. Malbrue teaching, we also had Dr. Coble and I think he's still in the area so he might still guest lecture)

They went through a curriculum redesign but last I heard, they still had a good selection of electives and then our clinical year was very customizable. Still not perfect - they have many of the systemic issues with vet school like treating the students as free labor to supplement their hiring shortages, and they don't see exotics in their hospital except for the necropsy floor and through lab animal - but I thought they did a fair job.Apoquel did not have a [significantly different incidence of cancers](https://avmajournals.avma.org/view/journals/javma/257/5/javma.257.5.507.xml) compared to other allergy therapies (corticosteroids and cyclosporine) which makes sense because it's fairly selective for JAK1. The caution for use in pets with a history of certain cancers also isn't really based on anything from the tox data for apoquel specifically, it comes from data on less selective JAK inhibitors (such as Jakafi and Xeljanz) used on the human side. Theoretically blocking JAK1 (and therefore IL2 and IL4) carries some risk of inhibiting NK Cell activation which should still be considered in patients with a history of certain types of cancer.Join ARAV if you haven't already! There's a student Facebook page; we have some fun plans to get it more interactive this yearTbh it's kind of a matter of picking your battles. Ideally we'd do it perfect every time, but that's not really practical (especially on a senior pug!) so in that case it depends on the test you're running and what you're after. 

Like most if not all tests run off a blue top NEED to be perfectly full and NEED to be a clean stick because they tend to be for coags. I don't really care so much if it's going into a serum separator, since it'll clot anyway, as long as we're not hemolyzing the sample a ton. Purple is kind of an in-between with a frustrating amount of ""it depends"" - if it's just for a 4DX I wouldn't be too concerned, if it's for wellness I care a bit more but not the end of the world, if I'm suspicious or monitoring like a low platelet number, I'd absolutely want it to be a clean stick and a full tube on just that stick.. and if you have to poke twice and can get enough for a full purple the second poke, I'd rather have that purple all be from the same stick, but I'd also rather have one full purple with the right anticoagulant to blood ratio vs two partially-full purples with the wrong ratio if that's what it comes to. 

Also adding through a vaccutainer can be problematic because that vacuum is calibrated to the ideal draw volume for the tube and if you lose the vacuum, you're then guesstimating the right ratio, although depending on what/why you're testing that can be more or less problematic. Pushing into the vaccutainer through the needle can also lead to hemolysis, so if I have to add to a purple, I usually take the cap off and remove my needle.I'd second trying to shadow a local practice, but you'd likely have to be over 18 for them to allow it.

In the meantime try and get some general horse experience if you haven't already. If you're already involved in the equestrian world a bit, it'll be easier to get into equine medicine. I worked with a therapeutic riding stable to learn basic horseman terms, safe handling, and basic equine husbandry stuff.I do mixed exotics.

I prefer to autoligate where possible (cats, small dogs) but still do a three clamp technique and strangle knot for the uterine body. I do modified three clamp for larger dogs with one circumferential in the crush and one transfixing. I typically use hemoclips for rabbits. Small rodents are often just cautery. 

I do scrotal neuters for cats, prescrotal for dogs, varies for other species. 

I tend to close any incision with intradermals, since it keeps the animal from messing with the incision as much. I do a local block for the same reason. A lot of exotics don't tend to do well with a cone, and I don't always trust owners to use a cone anyway, so the more I can take matters into my own hands, the better.Like the other comment said, salary, expected work hours, staffing ratio. Clear and straightforward. 

I also like to see certain amenities (I like having an ultrasound and endoscopy and in-house labs. I mainly use endoscopy for exotics, though). I want to be able to practice the way I feel comfortable and have the tools to be successful. 

I do NOT want to see non-competes or other restrictive components to the contract. I don't really care about production if the base salary is good, but I don't want to see negative accrual. I also don't really care about equity. 

And I'll absolutely ask during an interview how long your staff has been there, about your turnover rate, about the number of RVTs vs assistants.. I'm looking for a place that can retain their staff, and has enough well-trained staff that I can focus on being a doctor.Oh absolutely. I was a vet assistant in high school, it was a really steep learning curve but after a couple months I got used to handling and everything. Tbh, for the syringe thing, just ask if you can take home a syringe without a needle and practice pulling it back and handling safely. Don't be afraid to ask - safety first!

I ended up leaving vet med for a while to pursue archaeology and then ended up in medical research and then eventually a small zoo.. and didn't come back to small animal until I got a job as a vet assistant in vet school. It was a steep learning curve all over again, I was like ""what the heck is a cytopoint"" (when I'd left small animal practice, apoquel had just come on the market) and cat handling and care had come along SO far (and tbh the field is all the better for it!)Depends on your state practice act. I would also make sure to get full informed consent from the owner. 

I was allowed to assist with TNR during my first year of vet school under supervision from a vet, and my school did a summer externship program for first years where they could do small animal practice after their first year under supervision, including surgery duties.

And I would get the SAVMA student liability insurance if you're doing it.I really enjoyed comparative physiology and pathology. It's really cool to see the different ""answers"" that life came up with for different problems. On the pathology side of things, sort of same idea but it's also neat to see the different ways things can go wrong, but also the unexpected similarities across different species. 

I also really enjoy teaching and client education is a huge part of the job. My big clients as a clinician were all massive nerds.. and then my new position will have me teaching vet students and tech students. I also have a tik tok where I host journal clubs that gets like maybe 50 followers and tens of likes, but every so often someone will comment like ""oh my gosh this is so cool!"" And that makes it worthwhile...I mean if the owner declined diagnostics for the infectious disease case that's not your mistake, that's on them. In most circumstances, you can't have an accurate diagnosis without running diagnostics. Just make sure your recommendation and what they declined is in the record.

And as far as the spay goes, sometimes spays do be bleeding. I'm literally published on hemostasis in uterine surgery (from a translational research perspective for hysterotomy but still) and I still get bloody spays. 

End of the day, you do your best with what you've got.Some residency programs require an internship, so it'll vary by the program/type of residency you're applying to. An internship does make you more competitive regardless. You can still do an internship after time in GP (that's what I'm doing for pathology, which doesn't require an internship anyway but it's become so competitive that it may as well)Also check the individual governing organizations page (you can find open spots outside the match) and reach out to residency coordinators early, individually. Pathology doesn't use VIRMP at all and when I worked for Michigan medicine in lab animal medicine (ULAM) they had their individual deadline a fair bit earlier than the VIRMP deadline and would make offers early if they had a good candidatesIf you like inverts, Lewbart is the go-to.

For pathology of herps, Jacobson's atlases. For pathology of warm fuzzy critters, Percy and Barthold lab animal. I do a lot of necropsy so even if you're not a path person, good to have.

I like Noga for fish

PurplePotatoCat,"Ask your clinic about a dosimeter badge to measure the amount of radiation you’re being exposed to taking x-rays. Ideally every clinic should have them, and every employee should have their own badge. Try to rotate who takes x-rays to limit exposure. Wear you’re PPE including gloves. Stay out of the primary beam. Use sedation, then you can typically move further away, and get quality x-rays the first shot instead of having to take multiple because of movement etc. Collimate the xray, don’t get the whole pet when the point of interest is a paw. I’m sure their are more tips. Consider looking into CE about x-ray safety.

Also just because another tech/assistant/doctor doesn’t follow proper safety protocol doesn’t mean you don’t have to or should feel like you can’t or be embarrassed that you do. You have to do what is best for your health, even if others aren’t taking the same precautions.I’m a US general practice vet, I graduated about 3 years ago. I have about $320K in student loan debt, with about $20K from undergrad. Majority of my classmates have similar debt. My current salary is $100K per year not including monthly production bonus which ranges from about $500- $3K or higher per month based on if I took vacation, if we have a full schedule etc. I also work maybe 2-3 relief shifts per month where that extra pay I split between loans and a high yield savings account. I graduated with $360K student loans with a $13K private loan that I have paid off. While I do overall stress about my student loans, I have had no problem making my payments and it isn’t a significant source of stress on a day to day. I feel like I have a pretty good quality of life, I don’t splurge often but I can buy nice things if I wanted. That being said, I’m married (my husband is currently between jobs and going back to school), we do not have children or any medical problems. 

I do not live above my means. I grew up kinda poor and I am used to living without. I live more comfortably now than I did ever growing up. So while being in debt is not ideal, it also isn’t the end of the world if you truly want this job. Granted that is different for everyone. If debt is going to really stress you out then for sure look at other options, but unfortunately being a vet typically means going into debt unless your family is well off. Majority of veterinarians are in large amounts of debt, it is terrible but it is also probably not changing anytime soon.Ooooh, they don’t offer deferment while you’re in school?

yesterday an owner came in with a big barking lunging bully. she was clearly exhausted and embarrassed as i loudly, but calmly, collected a history over the barking. she opened up about how she felt so judged at the other vets she'd tried, and that he's a wonderful loving baby in every other situation. being able to reassure her and watch the embarrassment slowly turn to appreciation is soooooo rewarding. it's hard out there for reactive dog owners who just want to do what's best for their pets, and we're in a unique position to show them patience.already commented but ALSO: when a cranky cat comes in for a dental, then after some extractions they wake up from anesthesia a purring loving little angel XD","Veterinarian.

Open_Efficiency2939,"Everything I go to the vet I feel for the practitioners. I realize I mainly get a quick diagnostic because how overwhelmed they might be. It's understandable and hard for both the client and professional. My heart goes out to anyone up for the task. I love animals but being a vet seems overwhelming. 

My solution... not being about the money and how many dogs can be saved and limit the amount you see and spend quality time with them. Hell almost sounds what our health care should be like in B.C. Canada.

It’s my whole world and I wouldn’t have it any other way.I wholeheartedly disagree with you and your statement is abhorrent. You shouldn’t be a veterinarian.If you’re not a veterinarian then why are you even commenting about what you would and wouldn’t euthanize? Cats can have behavioral issues for many reasons. Stress, anxiety, disease etc. You should always have a diagnosis and a backup plan before you start talking about euthanasia. That is ALWAYS a last resort.My husband (a veterinarian) put it perfectly. If you had a child that had inappropriate urination, would you kill it or try to figure out what is wrong? …He’s not a vet. And euthanizing a cat that has inappropriate urination without trying to rehome, trying meds, considering lifestyle (eg litterbox count, stressors etc) is not exhausting every resource…I don’t know what state you live in but veterinarians are the only ones who are legally allowed to euthanize animals in my state!So what exactly is your title?

baneyney1234,"I am one those people with mathematical problems. Most of my classmates are very good with understanding math problems, but during college of prevet where algebra, trigonometry and other subjects were very hard for me to understand so I really needed to study and memorize the way my instructors and classmates handle math problems. I was lucky enough to have statistics roomates and engineering roomates that spent their time trying to help me solve them. Statistics I would say would be the prime type of math that will come up and use during vet school, and if you are in research base vet field, it is vital for you to know basic statistics. 
My point is that if you really don't have the smarts for maths, you need to really try and study because you need it to graduate.Between the long hours, difficult clients ansd cases and oppression of the job itself by other people, it is only rewarding in a very few instances. Unfortunately, the third of my life has been circled around my profession and I don't know how to do anything else.

Visible_Damage851,"Hey all! New to reddit, but stumbled upon this forum while doing veterinary school research so I thought it was worth a shot. I'm a junior biology student who is looking to apply for a PPVM program this Fall. I interned at a clinic my senior year of high school and have been working seasonally since then to complete around 1,275 paid hours as a VA. I'm pretty involved on campus and have numerous leadership positions within important organizations. I'm holding a 3.94 after the hardest semester of my college experience and I'm picking up two large animal shadowing opportunities this semester. With my program not having an entry exam or even an interview process, I'm feeling extremely nervous about how competitive it's going to be. At this stage, I'm looking to build a spotless and diverse resume for my application. Are there any opportunities I should be seeking out? Are there any changes I should make?Thanks for your response :) Research is something I considered a little too late. It's something I may do my senior year in the Spring after my application, but right now I'm hoping to find shadowing opportunities outside of the standard small animal clinical setting. Hoping to work again later this semester, but school is going to come first, especially to hold my GPA. Worst case scenario, I'll be working this summer and likely most of the next semester.

Ohimesama781,"I remember a colleague of mine sharing a story abt a dog patient she had that had open-type pyometra. Owners were given the treatment options available (surgery or conservative tx with antibiotics); she also highly recommended that surgery be done. Owners declined surgery, decided to do an antibiotic course instead. Medications were prescribed, clients were educated on how to give said medications and other things to note abt their pet's condition (and to bring in their pet immediately if the symptoms seem to be worsening even with the medications). They were also advised to come back for a follow-up after a week if the pet's condition seems to be improving with the prescribed medications.

A week after the first visit, the dog is brought in in a worse state than their previous visit, owners are frustrated because their dog is worse than before. Colleague asks if they've given the medications as prescribed. The owners' response? No, they haven't given the medication *at all*. 🙃","Veterinarian.

DutchessGodiva,"I sure hope so, best of luck on your journey and feel free to pm me if you have any questions :)Just bare in mind a lot of schools outside of the country are quite on par in terms of cost and living expensive compared to the US. Only one that's for sure cheaper is UNAM in Mexico from what I gathered.   


Best of luck to your journey :) Let me know if you have any questionsThey are both decent. I liked Zuku's lectures and explanations more however downside of Zuku was I cannot highlight part of the questions which made reading long questions a bit difficult.

Other than that both are decent and everyone has good experience with them. Most of the navle comes down to doing questions and getting used to the way the questions are worded and presented which I think both vetprep and zuku does a good job ofThis would take some research, if you google search and type in either temporary, or supervisional vet license, there are different regulations depending on the state. I would say more and more states are allowing vet grads pending NAVLE exam/licensure to practice with decent salaries in the meantime which at least gives you some peace of mindKey thing is reading the wording of the question. Just using the following as an example, a dog with CCL rupture, answer for best treatment would likely be surgical. 

However the NEXT most appropriate option for the patient would likely be either Cage Rest or Weight Loss depending on the way the question is phrased and how the patient is presented.

Hope this kind of makes senseThank you that means a lot :)  


Here is the most recent list of the AVMA accredited schools in and out of US

Just make sure to look up their tuition etc for INTERNATIONAL/OOS students since they can drastically vary versus the local students.   


In my opinion and this is just my opinion, you will have to go in debt regardless wherever you go. Nowadays salaries for vets in North America is at least somewhat respectable where hard-work and the right situations can pay off your loans in a ""reasonable"" time versus a lifelong debt from what I gatherHi happy to answer your specific questions you may have.

I need help distinguishing between animal experience, research, and veterinary experience.

I completed most of my basic pre-reqs (gen chem, orgo, biology) with fairly good grades. I’m planning on completing a post bacc to complete the other science credits I need. I haven’t had a lot of extracurricular vet experience during school —- I attend a pretty intense college and have been managing some mental health struggles.

How do you gain veterinary experience with a non-stem major? Where/when can you start?
What do vet schools think about gap years? (I’m planning to take some time off and do/learn about other things I love — farming, backpacking, travel — before vet school.)
What can you do as a vet beyond small animal or equine? Are there positions that allow you to travel and/or help places without many vets, kind of like Doctors Without Borders?

Not all clinics are pits of despair, but finding a good one is difficult. Take as much time as you need (if you can afford it) and consider your options. When interviewing, be sure to talk to the staff and find out their staff turnover. Do several days of shadowing any potential opportunities and don't sign a 60-day notice period again (and definitely do not sign a non-compete - I don't know where you are in Canada, but some provinces still allow them).  Consider reaching out to local locum vets as they will give you the inside scoop on local practices and whether they'd be a good fit for you or not. If you happen to be in BC, feel free to reach out to me, and I can hopefully get you in touch with people who can help guide you. 

You went to school for so many years and worked so hard getting your DVM- before giving up on the profession, consider time to refresh, renew and gain some perspective. For context, I've practiced for 23 years. I've been an associate, practice owner, worked in specialty and emergency, and now am a locum. I haven't exactly found myself either, but there are a lot of opportunities for different kinds of practice, and many non-clinical opportunities too. 

Good luck!I have an unpopular opinion as a Canadian vet. Don't take on debt of that magnitude. I have had a couple of very good vet assistants apply to WCVM and be offered non-IPA (non-subsidized) seats for admission, which meant they'd pay about $70,000 a year in tuition (in BC, until recently there were only 20 subsidized IPA seats per year for the entire province). I sat down with them and planned out housing costs, food costs, tuition, etc... during school, and then what loans of that magnitude would mean upon graduation, especially if they wanted to come back to BC (where housing costs are insane) to practice. Both realized that given the average salary for vets here, financially it wasn't worth it. One is now happily in another non-veterinary professional school, and the other went to college for a human health care program that has a similar salary after graduation with far less debt and time in school.  
There are so many of us who are dissatisfied with the profession, and I know a lot of veterinarians who have left or pursued lower-paying, non-clinical roles. But my colleagues who have that huge debt load seem especially worse off, especially concerning their mental health, as they can't afford to explore other options. So my advice would be to make yourself competitive for the in-province option, consider a non-veterinary career, or win the lottery. Good luck to you!Compression socks and Hokas for the win.","Veterinarian.

SuggestionWild3935,"FACTS ! I got a job at a private practice now and am absolutely loving it. Just practicing medicine man 😭Hi ! 
So I’m not a DVM maybe I should clarify that in the post. I am a PM (or was) I was told I was having “performance issues” for not meeting revenue goals - when my hospital had no doctors, no controlled drugs so we were unable to perform any surgeries and was solely working on relief. This was a known thing about my hospital even before I took it on 5 months ago - but things were looking up.I wasn’t a DVM. I was the practice manager ! I recruited a DVM for my hospital that was solely working on relief.Unfortunately I see that a lot after meetings with higher ups. Hopefully she’s going better where she’s at !We got a new FD a few months back and she’s gotten rid of two PMs so far. She just kept saying I was having “performance” issues but wouldn’t give me specifics or set up an action plan with me. During our last call she told me she didn’t think I was in the right position and if I didn’t step down or resign she’d he “forced to pursue DA” and had already gotten approval for a final when I’d only ever gotten a verbal once. If I didn’t resign she was going to fire me. I tried to step down but then they said they couldn’t support that but they accepted it as my resignation.I am not a doctor 😅😅 I was a practice managerIt’s not that easy and it would have really affected my career leaving on “bad terms”Yes I know I’m no longer eligible. 😅😅

405tothe101,"“Dr. Name, DVM” is actually repetitive since DVM is doctor of veterinary medicine. Standard is usually either “Dr Name” or “Name, DVM”. If you are going to be in a general practice, I would go with “Dr Name” since most clients don’t know what DVM means unfortunately. 
I would also wait until you start your new job since most places do have a uniform stipend to order scrubs or lab coats, and they may want their logo on it as well.Actually, while I see your argument, I disagree. Your degree confers the title. It is the reason someone with a PhD is also referred to as Doctor. The minute you get your degree, you can call yourself doctor. Whether you pass your boards, practice medicine, go into industry or academia, you are a doctor.Ok, I see your argument, but I do believe we are discussing two different things here. 

When OP asked about using “Dr Name, DVM”, they implied they are graduating from a US based school, or one that confers a doctorate in veterinary medicine. US graduates need a doctorate in order to practice medicine - so I was speaking to the cultural standards in the US. 

I understand you may be in the US practicing with a foreign degree, or still practicing in your country with that degree - and in other countries, being a veterinarian may not require a doctorate degree. Those countries set their own standards to confer the doctor title. When you move to the US, you are required to undergo degree verification which reviews your coursework from your university to determine if you received doctorate level coursework, or if you have to complete additional training in the US in order to get that determination. 

There is no attack here on you or your ability to use the term doctor, but purely a cultural difference that was not clearly stated.I could never get a Millers knot (modified or regular) regardless of how much I tried, so I always double ligated. I would recommend being sure your suture size is appropriate for the size of your pedicles, and always unclamping your closest clamp, tightening your ligature down again, then reclamping. I always find the extra splaying with the clamp affected how tight I could get it, especially when ligating close to the clamp.","Veterinarian.

scoonbug,"I think they are concerned their license may be in jeopardy because there are a bunch of drugs missing.You can work for the USDA in some capacity I think.  My dad is a veterinarian and was having an existential crisis in the 90’s and talked about working for a meat processing place as a veterinarian.

But it’s hard to make suggestions without knowing what you dislike about clinical practice.  Is it the clients and diag?  There’s shelter medicine… that’s mostly spay/neuter and upper respiratory.  The nice thing about that is that you work for a nonprofit you can qualify for debt forgiveness, tooThere is a Brazilian vet working in my dad’s hospital right now that is working on the ECFVG.  She’s been in the US now for about a year and a half.  I think it has been a little easier for her than many foreign vets because she has dual citizenshipIf it’s AVMA accredited I don’t think you have to go through the ECFVG.  Your main obstacle would just be getting a visa.  Where in the US are you wanting to go?This is a good point.  I would consider euthanizing a cat with inappropriate litter box behaviors a justifiable behavioral euthanasia if the owners had made a good faith attempt to resolve the issue (c/d stress or calm, Feliway, etc).  My reasoning would be that the alternatives are to either live with piss and shit in the house or move the cat into a rescue setting (which will likely make the problem worse).  But I’ve heard of vets not agreeing.

Edit: I’m kind of surprised by the downvotes, I didn’t think this opinion was that controversial.  Euthanasia is an option to alleviate suffering… if an animal is exhibiting behavioral pathologies related to stress or anxiety that havent responded to treatment I would think it would be fair to say that animal is sufferingI’m not a veterinarian.  I’m an animal welfare professional.  So what would you do with a cat that has behavioral pathologies likely related to stress or anxiety that isn’t responding to treatment?  Keep in mind, animal shelters already have to euthanize healthy cats with no behavioral pathologies every day.  Why should the cat that is suffering not be euthanized but the healthy adoptable ones should be?I work in animal welfare and have this conversation a lot.  You say “we don’t have space you’ll have to take him to the city shelter,” and they say “I can’t take him there, they will kill him!”

But the city shelter is going to do everything they can before they get to that point, and if they get to that point it’s in the animal’s best interest.  Euthanasia is an act of compassion, not an act of malice.  Animals get euthanized because the alternatives result in the animal suffering.People (as in the pet owners) can make whatever decisions they want, but if an owner said they’re not willing to live with that are you saying they are bad people or are you saying they’re making a different judgment based on the facts available?

Because an animal hospital that refuses to consider a euthanasia in that situation is simply offloading an (admittedly) unpleasant aspect of the job to animal control officers and shelter workers (who are actually the ones euthanizing in the animal welfare space, not veterinarians).  If the shelter has 10 condos and 11 cats, the cat that was surrendered for inappropriate eleimination is going to be the one euthanized.Do you think veterinarians are the only people that have to euthanize animals?And if the inappropriate elimination was obviously caused by stress or anxiety… let’s say it started when the owners had a baby.  The owners have tried nutraceuticals like Hill’s c/d stress and Royal Canin, have tried pheromones like Feliway, and have even tried psychotropics (let’s say they’ve even gone so far as getting it compounded in flavored chews).  So this family has really gone the extra mile.  

What would you as a veterinarian say to these owners in a euth consult?What state are you in?So you’re going to rehome a cat that’s already stressed and anxious (enough that he’s displaying behavioral pathologies) and put him into an unfamiliar place?  And you think that’s going to solve the problem?  Spoiler alert: it probably won’t, so you’ll just have a new owner in the same situation as the old owner.Would you charge them for the consult?

I’d invite you to think about this from another perspective… an argument could be made that the cat is legitimately suffering: it is having behavioral symptoms of extreme stress/anxiety.  The owners have contacted shelters and have been told they will euthanize because they don’t consider this cat adoptable.  They are trying to do the right thing: they raised this cat, they want to be with it when it passes so that the last thing it knows in this world is a familiar face.  You can’t see that as an act of compassion, both to the cat and to the owners?

A follow up question: by refusing, there’s a good chance they will not seek out another veterinary professional resulting in a worse outcome for the cat (getting turned out on the streets, getting surrendered to a shelter and euthanized by strangers, etc etc).  Does that change anything?

Please don’t interpret any of this as negative judgment upon you, I’m just interested in your thought process.  This is like the trolley problem.And who do you think is going to agree to adopt a cat that won’t use a litter box?  You’re being naive.Not a recent anecdote, but my dad had a vet working for him in the 80’s and 90’s (small animal) that quit to go do a phd in laboratory medicine and it turned out really well for himThis is a subject I find really interesting.  My father (licensed in ‘71) took a veterinary communication seminar for the first time about 15 years ago… it was called Frank and was out of Colorado State.  He LOVED it.  Kept talking about how he wished they had something similar when he was in school.

He sends his vets and one of them (licensed in the 80’s) who I’m super fond of was telling me about how stressful the role plays were and how a couple of the other DVM’s started crying during.  I asked her if she got anything out of it and she told me “you don’t take someone that’s never ridden a horse before and put them on an untouched mustang.”I do think the value of the communications seminars is lost on certain types of students (seems like primarily non traditional students).  But vet schools do seem to select for a certain type of student (probably because admissions are so competitive) that one of my former employees called “aliens in human suits,” and those types of students, whether they know it or not, have pretty remedial communications skills.  Which strikes me as funny, since so many get hustled into production pay structures that effectively turn them into salesmen that don’t have a salesman’s soft skillsMy dad said “I learned there are certain people I want to lecture to instead of listen to.”  I said “like who” and he said “like you, I want to lecture to you”So much wisdom I’ve received… like why large animal medicine sucks “all a horse is thinking is I wonder if there’s a way I can kill that guy,” dating advice “steer clear of horse girls son they have way more expensive tastes than you can afford,” and even medicine “never let a dog die without some dex and baytril on board”I run a rescue and rehab center that’s partnered with an AAHA hospital.  If you want better than shelter pay, salary not production, and are ok with a hybrid model that involves both shelter med and traditional clinical small animal practice we would love to talk.The problem we’ve found is that we haven’t leaned hard enough into the shelter med stuff.  It’s 20-30% of the practice, but many of the vets that have come to work for us find the rescue work aggravating or a waste of time (which would be understandable if they were on production, I guess).

I’ve contacted A&M to see if there was a shelter med student association I could talk to and they said there wasn’t :(This is a different perspective (I’m not a DVM, I run a rescue and rehab center that is a partner org to an AAHA hospital owned by my father), but in this market you have all the leverage.  

If I were a DVM, my contract priorities would be: 1) salary, not production… it’s a misalignment of practitioner and client incentives and you’re a doctor not a salesman; 2) staff ratios that align with my practice style; 3) defined (and followed) appointment scheduling rules; 4) standard of care established by DVM’s not practice admins or managers; and 5) a certain “budget” for pro bono or discounted work for “at risk” animals (basically, a commitment from the hospital to do at least a small amount of shelter / rescue work).

It seems that a lot of the advice on here focuses on negotiating tips regarding compensation, but there’s only so much juice you can get out of that orange.  I know y’all all have a lot of debt and compensation is important, but I think it’s equally important that a hospital recognizes your needs, wants and interests as an individual.  Talk to your practice management about what you want and need if you want to stay there, be clear about it and that you intend to leave if those needs aren’t met.  If you want to explore other options, be very clear with other potential employers about what those needs are and that you want them to commit to meeting them.There was a discussion about tattoos in my dad’s veterinary management group a few years back because someone had a tech with a tattoo of a naked woman and they came to the conclusion that anything more salacious than PG-13 needed to be covered.

So, a group of 50+ year old practice owners don’t care about tattoos, and just would ask you to cover them if they’re dirty.  Also while they’re more common amongst support staff, there are still a ton of tattoos in vet medI’m not a veterinarian, but my father is an owner/practitioner and I run a rescue and rehabilitation center that’s partnered with his hospital.  Given how hard it is to find veterinarians, I would think that the PM could try to find more surgeries (through marketing or rescue/shelter contracts) but I don’t see how 5 procedures a day is enough production to cover the salary.A veterinarian that worked for my dad was apparently a brilliant student (for whatever that’s worth, he’s in in 70’s and school was 50 years ago).  He was number 2 in his class until number 1 dropped out to go to med school.

ACatOfTheCanals,"I worked a year in GP, feeling the same dread and anxiety you did. It sucked. The anxiety and self-doubt I felt every day was terrible. The only thing that helped me was having a wonderful support system outside of work, AND working at a clinic that had zero tolerance for toxicity. 

But I knew myself. And I knew end of life care was where I wanted to end up. I worked that year in GP so that I would have more context, experience, clinical knowledge, etc. I don’t regret it. But man, it almost broke me.

At the end of that year, I bid GP goodbye forever and am now working as an IHE vet and am more content with my life choices than ever. I just wanted to chime in with a slightly different experience. While it may be very true that, for you, it’s just this clinic that is the problem—it’s also possible that maybe it is general practice itself that you aren’t comfortable with.

I spent a year, miserable, in GP. I actually had a relatively supportive mentor and pretty friendly staff. I was just terrified, everyday, of making a mistake. It was all-consuming. I was miserable on my days off. I would stress about patients when I was home. I hated that appointment times were so short, and that I had to treat each patient and owner so briefly. I knew two months into GP that it was a bad fit. Family and friends told me to stick it out. They told me it was just this clinic; if I went somewhere else, somewhere with more support, then I’d have an easier time with it and learn to live with it. 

Literally the ONLY times in GP when I wasn’t crippled with self-doubt were when I was performing euthanasias and having end-of-life conversations. I felt confident, self-assured when I was approaching an end-of-life case—the way that my vet friends would talk about their GP jobs. And I realized two months into GP that end-of-life care was my calling.

I stuck it out for the full year though—not because I wasn’t sure about making the switch, but because it took me ten more months to convince my partner, friends, and parents that I wasn’t insane for ditching GP to go into end-of-life care. They told me I was wasting my degree, that I’d lose all the knowledge I learned in school. They thought for sure I would regret it. When they finally saw that, not only was I not more confident in GP than when I started, I was somehow even more paralyzed with self-doubt, they reluctantly got on board with me making the switch.

I took a month off between my GP job before I started with my in-home euthanasia job to reset my mental health. I’ve been in end-of-life care now for a year and a half, and I have never been more fulfilled or at peace with my decision. This is where I belong. And if I had listened to everyone else who had told me that I should stay in GP, I would be very, very miserable. 

That’s not me saying GP is a bad fit for you. I just wanted to provide an alternate take to leaving veterinary medicine entirely.I left small animal general practice after only a year, and even that one year was a struggle for me emotionally. I now work for an in-home euthanasia service, and I feel very fulfilled. It’s a much better fit.","Veterinarian.

MissAnthropy_YIKES,"I've found that I have a much easier time with the domestic pet euth situation than with the industrial euth situation. In the former, enormous effort is taken to show respect and deference for the life and experience of the animal and the owner with whom they have a relationship.  In the latter, the lack of such respect is much harder for me- there's much more internal emotional friction. 

Every time I've had a particularly difficult euth and have shown personal emotion in front of owners, they have only taken it positively. They clearly take it as a validation of the relationship they have with their pet, validation of their current emotional response to losing their pet, and so on. Far too many people equate our asking for money in return for veterinary care with ""not caring."" This is the stuff that reminds them that we're just like them, and of course we care.The barriers that have been stopping my practice from switching are: very prohibitive cost, incomplete or problematic data preservation and transfer between old and new system, and stretched staff has no time to change all SOPs to reflect new software.
It's just too many hits all at once to fix something that isn't even broken because it's just not great.I've worked through 2 corporate buyouts: vca 18 years ago, and wvp 3 years ago. 

Vca was a nightmare in many ways and many of us quit after a year.

Wvp has been surprisingly painless. No one has quit. They're intentionally pretty hands-off, especially compared to what was expected. They made sure our practice manager and medical director (lead doctor) were competent, and now they leave things to us, mostly. I imagine that if our practice had been a shitshow at the time of the buyout, there would have been much more of corporate ""taking the wheel,"" so to speak. It's nice that if employees need Ada accommodation or need help from hr, we now have the resources of a big company available to us.Is this a direct response to my comment? 

Are you essentially saying that it sucks people have to use ERs which have long waits?

Round_Fall620,"Is getting a vet tech degree worth it to become a vet?

I’m a senior in high school and I’m having a hard time figuring out where to go to college considering cost as well as what will look best and be the best route to vet school. I’ve been looking at colleges around the country that have pre-vet programs and I’d love to do those, but they’re so expensive and I really don’t want to get into a lot of debt so early on in life. Recently I’ve been looking at one of the nearby community colleges and they have a vet tech program where I can get an associates degree in Veterinary technology after getting some prerequisites done beforehand to actually get into the program. I know that what vet techs and vets do aren’t nearly the same nor is the necessary education which is what my concerns are. I do want to get a bachelors degree because I don’t know how far just an associates degree could get me as well as if I go to vet school there are many required courses that I most definitely won’t finish in just 2 years with an associates degree. Or should I just stick to going to a 4 year with a pre-vet program?

Sorry this is kind of wordy, but if anyone has any advice or any I’d love to hear it!! I’ve posted it on the vet tech subreddit and I’ve heard that it wouldn’t be much help because a vet tech degree would of course cater to vet tech careers and not the prerequisites for vet schools, but majoring bio or chem with a minor in animal science may be helpful.","Other.

Lopsided-Switch-8404,"My partner is currently an intern at a well known and well regarded small animal rotating internship. I'm in a different profession that is also known for having long hours and a very demanding culture, especially when you first join the profession or work at the ""elite"" level. 

Working long hours because you are in a complex, busy, and demanding profession is fairly understandable to me. What is blowing my mind about the veterinary internship and resident process is the level of abuse interns receive from residents and senior clinicians. Some of the things people say to interns would get people fired immediately in my profession, and my profession is known for having a fairly cutthroat environment. So many senior veterinarians operate with the mentality of ""it was hard for me, and so it should be hard for you."" The point of the internship seems to be suffering and discount labor, not training, patient care, or gaining experience.

This internship has formal rules that are designed to support interns (e.g., an intern can't have more than X number of inpatients at one time; hours limitations related to overnight shifts; etc.) that are openly and flagrantly violated on a daily basis. For example, after working for 15 hours and having well over the maximum number of permitted inpatients my partner asked if someone else could take one of my partner's inpatients. My partner was berated by a resident for being lazy and not caring about their patients. This happened publicly in front of other residents and clinicians and no one said or did anything. This is a common occurrence.

Vacman85,"I am now playing with Monero mining. I went from starting with Mysterium to running a Helium Hotspot, and now I have  Raspberry Pi, a Linux box, and a Windows matching running hashes. Between all three, I have made a total of roughly $10 over the last two week. Lols.

Edit: I’ve made about .003 Myst, and about $8.60 in HNT, and the rest with Monero.

Myst has been running the longest and I’m thinking about abandoning that project. Monero I just started about 36 hours ago - that one seems to have the best chance so far. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tijvgl/best_ways_to_earn_supplemental_income_aside_from/i1eoy9u/  I should mention that Monero mining does not use or allow GPU gear. So no need to have expense; impossible to obtain, equipment either. The real trick is to get into a mining pool - where the rewards are shared. Network Chuck (YT) had a great video on how to do this stuff (esp with Monero). The other guy to check out is “Your Friend Andy” on YT. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tijvgl/best_ways_to_earn_supplemental_income_aside_from/i1ev6n7/  Time will tell. I think the Helium ride is over - I’ve only been up and running for about two weeks, but I’ve watched the earnings steadily drip lower. Since I have the miner installed, I’ll leave it run until I get my hardware investment back at least. Too early to tell yet, but I’m hopeful on the Monero “farm”. I started running it on a Raspberry Pi 4 B (2 GB) and it barely works. I then did an install on my Linux box and that one is cracking hashes nicely. The Windows machine is doing ok. I do have another raspberry pie coming tomorrow (this one with 8 GB memory, so we’ll see how it goes there.

3DPvetguy,"Currently in vet school. Hard as hell but well worth it. It is a very good market for graduating vets with GPs making great salaries.I think it’s a very interesting opportunity. I’m pro-owning for sure. Valuation is very difficult because you probably don’t know how much the practice profits and the owner takes in yearly. Typically practice valuations go as a multiplier of the previous 12 months profit. 4-6x is pretty standard. Any higher than that is difficult to justify without significant opportunity to grow or add services. It’s one of the reasons corporations have been able to buy so many practices. They can afford to overpay, 8-10x profit for example, because they have deep pockets and they’ll make back the money by cutting costs or decreasing salaries. So it’s tough to say in this situation without knowing typical profit. I’d say anywhere between 8-20% profit is typically where most practices sit but there are outliers on both sides. So if you gross 5-6 M and profit 20%, then the valuation isn’t as crazy. If you profit 8% then it’s absolutely wild. 

As for partners I think it’s very situational. You can also organize it in different ways. Maybe you take a lead, pay more and have a larger portion and therefore more decision power. I also don’t see a huge problem with 4-5 equal partners with equal say as long as there is a good contract with out-clauses for each partner. Owning a practice can be an opportunity to set yourself, and your family if you have one, up for life financially. 

Would love to hear others perspectives and happy to answer any questionsMost of my classmates are getting between 4 and 6. If they are going to a city like NYC they may be hitting 10 because there are so many. A lot of them are a corporation offering them 2-3 locations in an area so they add up quick.

Prairiedawg123,"You can’t be your internal prosecution without being your internal defense council as well. It’s important to be aware of our weaknesses and try to improve them. But don’t give them more weight than they deserve. The first year of vet school can definitely mess with your head. You go from being among the smartest in a group to realizing how many people are smarter than you. You’re very intelligent or you would not be where you are. There’s more to be a great vet than intelligence and memory. Are you thorough? Compassionate? Thoughtful? Persistent? Determined? I’m sure you have qualities you aren’t even thinking of bc you’re focusing on what you aren’t. You have positives your friends probably don’t. Don’t borrow problems that are 3 years away either. The shyness isn’t something to worry about. By the time you’re a vet you will feel more confident in your skills and be able to communicate with clients. And if not there are so many non client facing jobs in vet med. if you’re feeling like your shyness holds you back then start working gradually on ways to overcome it. It’s a process. Give yourself some time and graceThis is insane to me as a private practice owner. I always call ER and speak to the dr if I’m transferring bc a client getting there and getting turned away doesn’t benefit the pet and the client is mad at me. I ask if there’s anything else they’d like me to do first before sending. I always send referral info for the same reason. We  get patients in for recommended rechecks at the recommended interval after being seen by ER. Not doing all of those things is bad for the pet, the client is pissed, and they wouldn’t want to come back to my clinic. Are the bad apples not clinic owners?Hi I’m going to dm you, mostly to show supportAre you a seasoned DVM? New grad? That matters because you didn’t mention things about the clinic that are so important- staff to DVM ratio, appointment length, mentoring if you’re new- actual structured mentoring and not just lip service. While the actual compensation seems a bit low, it’s not enough info.A million times thisWhy are you paying a percentage of profit? Veterinarians are usually paid a percentage of their gross production - usually 20-22% of gross production with their other compensation (benefits, CE, etc) increasing their total compensation to 25% of their gross production. I am a GP owner so I don’t know what % is competitive for a specialty, but 25% of the profit on a vets production is low.Possibly but net profit is used 3 times in the post, and there is a lot of emphasis placed on determining the costs and then subtracting those from revenue to determine pay. In the event OP truly means profit , I thought it necessary to point out in order to be helpful and help OP offer competitive pay to this DVM. There’s a big difference between the terms net profit and gross production and anyone responsible for determining what a DVM is paid needs to understand them.Wow so you recruited your replacement without knowing it? Corporations suck guys— the money always sounds good but it’s either an empty promise or they kill you getting every penny and more back from a production/work standpoint.I’m sorry you’re having this experience. You really should be paid for recruiting the DVM regardless of whether you are still there or notWould be happy to pay more than that in CincinnatiWhat? Thats insane. Find a new clinic asap. Where are you? I have friends that own clinics in several statesI have a friend in Wesley Chapel who is expanding and moving into a new building. She’s wonderful. I’m in a group called VMG with other private practice owners - my particular group has members from several states. If Wesley Chapel is too far for you, go to www.myvmg.com and click on the “work for a VMG practice” link. This shows listings for all VMg practices nationwide.

Just wanted to provide OP with info that they are eligible for govt loans as many ppl (including many Canadians I attended vet school with) do not know that an international uni is eligible for those grants/loans.

I have saved countless years trying to apply for vet school after my bachelors. The minimum I’ve saved is 2 years (3years bachelors with 4 year DVM) as my degree was 5 years. I am making an income now to pay down my loans. I want other 17/18 year olds to know that a Canadian Bachelors to DVM is not the only route.

erincatsj,"Can only speak on my personal experience with idexx, as a tech I find running all the tests to be quick and simple. It’s a pretty straightforward process for any staff that might be unfamiliar with in house machines. They even give you explicit directions on the screen when running dilutions. 

In my clinic we have most of the machines available: catalyst for chemistries/lytes/T4 (takes 10-15 min depending on which tests you’re running), procyte for CBC (takes only a couple minutes), sedivue for UA (I hate the strip reader but LOVE that the sedivue takes pictures of the sample so you can double check for bacteria/crystals/cells- way simpler than staining a UA to read, takes about 5-10 min) , coag for PT/PTT (3-5 min), blood gas values (10 min?? Not as confident on that number because we use it infrequently), and the snap readers. In an ER setting all of them get pretty regular use aside from the blood gas, mostly because the docs just prefer to run those on the istat. 

With our software, the results connect automatically as well which is really convenient. Idexx customer service is also great- if a slide/cartridge won’t run for some reason on any of the machines (even if there wasn’t enough sample), we can make a note of it and they will refund us for that test. They were also quick to respond when we ran low on our reagent kit on a extra busy weekend, and got one out to us before we lost the capability to run CBCs (:","Veterinarian.

animul_guy,"I would encourage you to look into Instinct Science. It’s a cloud based practice management software with integrated digital treatment sheets, ax sheets, and whiteboard so you can treat you patients and track their medical history all in one place. It was created by a team of veterinarians so you’ll notice the tools like plumb’s integration, patient warning systems so you don’t overdose a patient, drug calculators, and predictive billing are all used to make not just the veterinarians life easier but as well as the technicians and CSRs. Also, the user interface is pretty great.","Veterinarian.

julzyq,"I’m not a vet, so I can’t speak to how the job itself would or would not work for you. However, I do work for an in-home veterinary hospice and euthanasia service. Our DVMs are incredible and I admire their work. I’ve said goodbye to many of my own pets over the years - always at a clinic or an ER. This past December I scheduled in-home hospice for my dog, Roxxie. We were able to get her on meds to make her comfortable and set up a plan for her care. We were connected with a hospice nurse and the doctor checked in regularly. I was able to plan for Roxxie’s euthanasia at home and it was a beautiful and peaceful experience. We gave her all of the food she couldn’t have during her life (chocolate cake, cheeseburgers, chicken nuggets, etc.) and she was around her family and our other pets. The doctor gave Roxxie a subQ sedative while she was laying on her favorite couch with our other dog next to her. The doctor waited until Roxxie was fully sedated before placing an IVC and euthanizing her. My sister and I carried Roxxie out to the doctor’s car and covered her with her favorite blanket.
I am very close with several of our DVMs and they love what they do. Most of them work four to five days in a row and have said having two or three days off in a row in the best way for them to decompress. Some of our DVMs have never worked in a clinic and went straight to end-of-life care after graduating. If you have the passion for hospice and euthanasia, you’d probably find a position like that very fulfilling. 
Again- I’m definitely not a veterinarian and I’m sorry that was so long. Good luck in whatever you decide! ♥️

tomvet93,Also hepatic encephalopathy especially portosystemic shunts if you give a benzodiazepine they often have high endogenous benzodiazepines and very slow metabolism so could become profoundly sedated/respiratory depressed. Phenobarbital will also not be metabolised so will effectively be more potent.I agree that complications rate is concerning. I also worry about aiming for surgical time of 30 mins.

history_is_legend,"I cry at happy animal videos on my phone. I think starting out by volunteering / interning at a place to get your foot in the door and exposed to the medical side of animal medicine is a good start, especially in terms of wondering if it’s what you really want to do. As an empath, I get emotional all the time, especially when cases are really sad and we have to euthanize an animal. But that’s okay. Because it shows the owners how invested you are and how much you care. I won’t say it gets easier, and there is a level of “getting used to it,” but it’s okay to get emotional during the sad moments of vet medicine. In general practice, from my experience, there is a lot less devastation than you would experience in emergency. So feeling it out in different practices is definitely an option. Hope that helps.","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it discusses experiences and emotions related to veterinary medicine,",Veterinarian
