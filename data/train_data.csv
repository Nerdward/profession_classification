Goldinshaur,"Im from mexico, i used to be a medical doctor (oncology), it has been quite of a ride!, its also difficult to be a specialist but if you rich it is so well paid!, i had to move to canada with my husband and they want me to pay a lot and do all over again, so i decided to study and make something different that i always  wanted, if you want to study to be a MD or a Veterinary or even a nurse in both fields in mexico my only advice is to decide where you want to live and develop your career because not all countries revalidate that easily your background.

If you like your actual job, maybe having a side hustle can be a good option or move to another country that can easily revalidate and bring you great opportunities with the knowledge and certifications you already have.","Medical Doctor.

Noctuella,"Yes.  They know that they have valuable experience that you lack, and they don't fancy being told what to do by a person that's younger and inexperienced. And they are likely to have seen some young doctors come and go.  That said, some are patient and helpful as you grow into your role, while others are just toxic about it.

There's no one trick to getting them on your side. Maybe you're a ""That's Doctor Newbie to you, Susan"" type and maybe not (wouldn't be my choice).

When I was in your shoes I felt attacked. In retrospect I might have ignored it and waited for them to get over themselves (it can take years). Unless one of them is sleeping with the boss; in that case they will always be considered more important than you, so you need to either fight for some changes or brush up your resume.> “no offense you really don’t do well with any sick animal”

Even if this were true, which it doesn't sound like it is, it would be inappropriate coming from a tech unless they are also the hospital manager.  

You can either confront them yourself or take it to admin but one way or another it has to stop.  The last thing you need is coworkers who insult you and your skills on the regular.

They're within their rights to have another vet treat their animals, but their attacking you just for looking at them is over the top, hostile, and unacceptable.

If they can't improve with a politely stated ""Knock it off,"" I personally would very quickly arrive at ""When I want your opinion I'll ask for it"" but that may not be the most professional approach! 😉Can confirm. I had a couple of toxic coworkers early on and it felt like I was still in school.  Def affected my confidence and growth.Does management know they might lose a vet +/- new tech over this? I'd give them a chance to fix it.  If you're corporate you can go up the food chain until you find someone who will put a stop to it.I highly value the brains of experienced techs, especially those who can help out in a way that doesn't make me look like an idiot.  (""Hey, Doc, you want a glucose on that seizing kitten?""  ""Why yes, yes I do."")  I particularly admire a tech who can make a graceful transition from being somebody's boss to, theoretically, taking direction from them.  

This is why it's so frustrating when people are going around with chips on their shoulders, trying to sabotage each other.  There is nothing to be gained by a doctor trying to insist that people call them doctor if they're not feeling it.  There is nothing to be gained by a tech refusing to do their job because they won't be told what to do by someone younger.  People, get over yourselves, you have so many more important challenges to tackle.

marchbanks273,"Hey OP,

I have also gone through what you're going through. I had minimal vet experience before and through my degree, and COVID ruined my final year placements as a 2020 grad (they became online school instead). I came out as a veterinarian that had little knowledge and skill and as a result I suffered so much anxiety and imposter syndrome. It got to the point where I became scared of doing any consult where the patient was mildly sick and I almost left the industry.

I'm now three years out and at a teaching hospital teaching final year students, and it's cool to see how far I've come. What helped me was a supportive environment while I found my confidence. Vomiting cases more complicated than a maropitant injection used to terrify me, especially if they came back the next day. Now I actively enjoy the puzzle of figuring out the next steps instead of reacting with fear. I have coworkers that love to contribute their thoughts and are there to support me when things still don't go right. Even if you make a mistake, then the least you can do is make it a learning experience for yourself so that the next patient you encounter will benefit from what you've learned. I still get anxious time to time, and I think my first year as a new grad was not great for my imposter syndrome but time and experience has helped me so much with my nerves. You should never too be hard on yourself as a new grad - I'm sure the past you in early DVM would be very proud of the things you've achieved as a veterinarian, and when you're a seasoned vet you'll also look back on how far you've come. All the best!I'm an ER vet as well and I personally found this to be more useful over Thrall and radiology CE for my learning. Our clinic uses VetCT and when submitting radiographs you can ask specific questions you want answered. I usually have a go interpreting it myself and then you can get direct feedback from a radiologist. You have the option of discussing it further with them if required. I like it because they'll label where in the radiograph they see the pathology. I don't usually need them to come to a diagnosis but it's really helpful in situations like you described about wanting to know the subtle part of the radiographs, without needing to be awake in the day to speak to a radiologist.","Veterinarian.

Zestyclose-Row7742,"I’m not practicing yet, but I am in school and just finished the acupuncture certification course from Chi. I did the mixed animal track. It is very much eastern medicine and takes a different approach to understanding and describing disease processes. It does not contradict western medicine, but does take a different approach. I have learned to really appreciate integrative medicine and it has helped to shape the direction I would like to go in when I graduate. 

Personally, doing this track was pretty difficult on top of my course-load, but I am glad I took it. I look forward to being able to practice once I graduate. Also, I’ve had positive feedback from potential employers when I’ve mentioned it. There was also a significant discount for taking the course as a vet student. There are other options for certification; especially if you would prefer a more western approach. I’m not sure if these other institutions also work with vet students, but I think it’s worth looking in to. I would say if you can swing it, go for it.Hi!

I wish these experiences were more well known to the general public and pet owners. I’m stumbled across this after seeing some strange dynamics at my dog’s last visit at one of the Mars owned chains and I wanted to research a bit. 

I was interested in finding a new veterinary practice that’s kind to their staff because (selfishly) that staff is who is taking care of my baby. And after reading through this, as a consumer I have a responsibility to spend money responsibly and avoid companies with unhealthy labor practices.

nobrainnorabies,"hi. i thought i had written this. 
i left my rotating internship after 5 months. there were some specialists at my hospital who were incredibly hardass on the “i went through abuse and hell when i was an intern, and so should you” train. 
i remember asking for time to go to therapy and the surgical team scoffing at me.
i felt dread walking into the hospital every day, and didn’t stop being sick with anxiety until i sent in my resignation.

i only wanted to go into ER following the internship, i had no desire to specialize, so i was in a position where i was able to leave. i opted in for a rotating internship to gain experience and have mentorship, but i felt thrown to the wolves.

put yourself FIRST. it’s too early for us new grads to burn out of this profession. if this is souring you to the field, then it should be an alarm bells. i tried getting through it after i started feeling this way at month 3, and it made me worse mentally and emotionally.

fakedrmandontgws,"Two points here. May be controversial for both sides.

1. Yes, I think this a shared experience. Some techs often don’t give you the respect you deserve. It’s often discouraging, disheartening and can really make you feel bad about yourself. It’s hard, because you’ve worked hard and are probably struggling with your own negative self talk, let alone having to take onboard what the vet techs are saying as well. Brush it off and don’t let them get to you. Despite what the other commenter said, I disagree that you don’t deserve respect. You’ve worked hard.

BUT 

2. They’ve also worked hard. Don’t be arrogant about your position and make people call you “doctor”. It’s the wrong attitude to take towards things. You aren’t above them, nor are they above you. They should treat you with respect and an understanding that you know a lot of things that they don’t. Likewise, you should treat them exactly the same way.Yes, over 40 - 50 hours a week for a surgeon is very common. I’d say a borderline conservative estimate. Residency depending on where it’s done is more like 50 - 60 hours.Perhaps when you are further into your career. However, it would be unlikely whilst you’re practising as a registrar and even a newly boarded specialist. You also have to consider the amount of time studying, preparing for talks, conferences, etc.Thanks for the advice. ☺️Damn, I was hoping that if it wasn’t a medical problem it would be something that I would adjust to with time. What would that therefore mean for my longevity in the industry overall? I can’t imagine doing else, I really love what I do and the specialisation I’m aiming for.Where do you practice?

baumerman,"True, but if the DVM on record lies to the DEA and tells them the now fired employee stole the missing drugs, they could be liable as well. Best to get ahead of this situation and document everything.As a tech who has been in practice for about 15 years, the difference between new vets out of a real internship at a teaching hospital and those without is night and day. I would recommend you pursue an internship that includes specialty practice under board certified specialists. The pay and hours will be shit in the beginning, but your value afterwards will be substantially higher. You will also be much more comfortable dealing with all kinds of different situations that fresh grads get lost in.The difference is getting actual experience in different specialties. In GP, it's easy to think that you will only be seeing puppies and ear infections, but in reality most clients will do whatever they can to avoid the cost of an emergency hospital and will bring in all kinds of things that may fall out of the normal workflow of GP. Being able to do a solid ultrasound with some confidence and find a splenic mass for example could be life saving for a patient that comes into GP. This will increase your value as a vet and more importantly your comfort level in practice. It can be extremely stressful and unpleasant to be confronted with a case you don't know how to handle and training under specialists really does help with that. I don't mean to imply that it's necessary, because it isn't, but the quality of medicine I see coming out of interned vets on average is vastly superior to those without.","Veterinarian.

FDA/Food animalI'm out of state at LSU. No significant other, limited help from family (though they help with emergencies). Also have T1 diabetes and cats with newly developed chronic health issues. So, yeah, lots to spend. 

I'm a slightly non traditional student in that I got in at age 25, not straight out of undergrad. I own a house and the rent I get from that pays my mortage and my car payments, I had a little bit of savings after 4 years of ""adult"" life. 

With that being said I still have to take out max loans. I'm doing ok with about 1k left over from loans at the end of each semester. Over the summer I was given a research grant of about 6.5k which was incredibly helpful too. 

I work at an ER every weekend and use that as my spending money for me, I was able to ask for a pretty good hourly rate (19/hr after shift dif) so again, your mileage may vary on what you can get. But I know a couple people who either work at the school or outside. 

As we move into my third year I'm definitely running low on savings, I don't eat out much but still find the time to have social events as well.

Kindly-Metal-6421,"I agree with a lot of things you have mentioned, and most days I am staying unpaid overtime to follow a case, the boss isn’t always there to see,
I was also told to take only vaccine appointments at the beginning and I pushed myself way over my comfort zone and I am taking much more complicated ones. 
I did decline my day off to come in, for the main reason that it was after a full weekend first on call, where I had to come in multiple times and figure out what to do, if I was experienced it wouldnt take as much energy but being entirely new and overthinking everything takes huge energy alone, and that’s why I do need my days off to recover. 
My concern was mainly him overreacting and blaming me for reputation which I never messed with, I found it a bit unreasonable to expect a grad to do invasive surgeries in the first month. 
His job is to teach me and mentor me, he is paying me graduate salary and should expect me to learn and build a foundation with good skills not rushed in and overworked just so I can say I did it in few weeks. 
Otherwise I agree, I do have to put in more work than the others at the start. But I do need more time to recover and reflect. Hello! I am a vet graduate from an EU university, I had Canadian and American colleagues in the university with me. Make sure you apply for EAEVE accredited schools, it doesn’t matter which tbh, after that if you want to work in the US or Canada, you have to sit the NAVLE, that’s pretty much it. If you want to work in the UK, you only need to apply for equivalence with RCVS, no statutory exam required, I personally did that in less than 1 month. I personally don’t understand why anyone would be willing to have this amount of debt that might go on for years and add to the chances of burn out, there are alternatives. The schools are not free of course, and they are 6 year programs usually (some 5.5years) so if you have an undergraduate you might be able to exempt a few course maybe but you will probably need to start and do full years. Feel free to PM if you have more questions. Take care!That’s correct, I mentioned that EAEVE accreditation does not qualify you to work as a vet in US or Canada but if the university is listed, you are allowed to do the NAVLE (there are few steps before) and yes they do cost quite a few thousands, but I think it’s reasonable to do that as opposed to stacking up tens of thousands in student loans.

GhxxxstCat,"I will definitely be making a post about my cat who was neglected during his pui surgery. A vet tech who loved my boy so much called me one day and told me that she arrived to work and he didn't have his iv bags in and he was EXTREMELY BEHIND in pain management. I'm sure most of you know once you get behind the pain it's quite difficult to get back in front. She told me other things that were wrong.... and when I addressed these things during checkout/discharge I was told I'd get a call from the doctor and owner of the emergency facility- but it's been over a week and that hasn't happened. At all. I've called twice daily to ask to speak to them and somehow they're not available. I get it's an emergency ckinic... but I highly doubt nobody could get on the phone with me for 9 days straight.Why make a public post about an emergency facility when they neglected and didn't give an animal proper treatment or medication... ... hm.... where the FUCK do I begin..... Are you insane??? Are you OKAY??I am not trying to get anyone to harass anyone else but if there are people out there who experienced the same issues as another client who was neglected then I fully expect them to come forward publicly regarding the situation. This has nothing to do with the OPs story BTW. I'm focusing fully on MY OWN.If you'd like to hear about what I experienced I'd love to take the time to write it out for you. Thankfully baby is asleep for now and we have a second follow up at a different vet at 4pm today so just a few hours now. But I think you'd want to level my info with your personal opinion at the very least. Like i said I'm more than happy to write out what happened to me and the facility if you're personally interested and then feel free to respond regarding whether or not you feel it's appropriate to follow up with the facility regarding this.  

My point also was that I HAVE followed up with the emergency care center and it's been 3 days since my cst was released and they haven't called me back at all. I called 3 hours after we got home due to possible complications and they decided to never return the call. Ive called three times daily, every 8 hours.

ClearWaves,"Anatomy of great apes and humans is very similar. There  simply isn't a veterinarian with as much experience as this MD. Other specialty surgeries, like ortho or dentistry, are also performed by MDs or dentists.  The animals in question are too valuable to not have the best person available to perform the procedure. Would a human doctor be called to perform a c-section on a lion? No. The lion's anatomy is closer to a cat than a human, so a veterinarian is more suited for the job. 

As far as legality goes... every state has different laws, and different types of animals are governed by different laws. As in domestic pets, livestock, poultry, wildlife, laboraty animals, etc.

Research facilities follow different rules than a small animal general practice. As a zoo is likely accredited as a research institution. That means having to follow certain rules but also makes allowances for treatments that don't apply to a privately owned dog or cat.

dragon_cookies,"Tbh it’s concerning that you’re actively seeking ways for your daughter to take the “easiest” way out of getting her veterinary license. That mentality will serve very poorly in practice. The NAVLE is the same regardless of where you take it (obviously within the US) to avoid people doing exactly what you’re trying to do.As a third year beginning to receive offers from corporations, can you describe how they were not honest actors? I want to be as prepared as a can for negotiations. 

Just random info: I’ve asked them about the sign on bonus specifically and was told I’d receive 1/3rd at signing and the rest after 1 month of working. If I had to/wanted to leave the specific hospital, the bonus would follow me as long as I’d transfer to another hospital in their network. I worked for 4 years at the same corporation prior to vet school and have seen first hand how difficult it is to fire para staff, and have yet to see a doctor fired (even when constantly causing issues or failing to bring in the same level of production as colleagues). Not saying it’s not possible but neither myself nor anyone I know has known any doctor to be fired. 

I’m highly skeptical of any offer and refuse to sign anything until an attorney looks over it, but I love hearing all perspectives/experiences.Fostering and volunteering is great and so fulfilling, but be aware that most of the veterinary field will not provide that same wholesome feeling. Experiencing client-owned pets and the intricacies of medicine can give you a completely different perspective that you need to be aware of before pursuing a career of it. 

There’s also nothing wrong with continuing to foster and volunteer because that is so needed in this industry as well. But after working in a clinic you may find that medicine is your passion, and then you’ll have better clarity how to continue that path. Clinic work is first step though. Good luck on your journey!It definitely depends on what state you’re in, as laws on what you can legally do as an unlicensed tech vary btw states. Some states won’t really let you do much outside of holding pets and others allow you to do essentially everything a licensed tech can outside of a handful of things (intubating, rabies vaccine, etc).

Either way, even if you are limited in what your role is in the clinic the value is there as far as understanding the day-to-day expectations. I’d search for veterinary assistant roles to start with though. 

Unpopular opinion here, but I would accept a job at a corporate clinic (Banfield) if offered one. I got my start there and it gave me the most realistic view of how the industry works more than any other place I’ve worked at. Also taught me valuable skills that carried into vet school. Not all clinics are the same though, so if one isn’t working for you don’t be afraid to try another! It’s good to get a variety of experience anywayAgreed, I’ve seen them hold onto vets that consistently don’t meet “performance” goals and I’ve never heard of any vet being fired from there. The only one I’ve seen close to it was when a lawsuit was filed against one and then she resigned afterwards to stop practicing altogether.Exact same 6 finals in 5 days with new material being taught up to the day before the exam. Absolute garbage way of assessing learning. I’m going in to exams with As in all classes, but I guarantee I’ll drop to a B in some bc there’s just no way to score high enough on every final when they all have such high expectations within hours of each other. I feel like if I’ve performed well throughout the entire term I shouldn’t be penalized in the last week bc of unrealistic expectations and lack of any time given to study the new material.Right? It’s kinda mind-boggling. One of their first solutions is “see a doctor” and then their last one is essentially “become a doctor” lol like whatI think another thing to consider is where you want to practice after graduating. If you go to school in the UK and plan on working in the US, you’ll likely have to sit for additional tests to satisfy the requirements to practice in the US. If you plan on going to the UK and practicing in the UK, the starting salaries tend to be much lower so your debt to income ratio might be worse. While this is incredibly based on the individual, I caution people when trying to finish undergrad and vet school as soon as possible. I think there are important aspects of vet med (client communication, ability to negotiate and navigate contracts and management, expectations of the day to day) that come with more life experience and time working in a clinic prior that should be considered as well. There’s no real right or wrong answer, and it’s great you’re already putting so much thought into this, so I feel like you’ll end up making the best choice for yourself!","Other.

ComprehensiveTiger86,"ECC doc, heading into ECC residency and genuinely curious—why does this happen so often? Is it because rDVMs are so busy and don’t have time to sit on hold to talk to the ER? I get that and try to come to the phone as quickly as possible when a DVM is on the line. Is it because they find ER docs intimidating to speak with? Is it because they’re afraid we are going to say we are at capacity?

Also I get the feeling that even the ones who call don’t end up relaying any information to the client (like projected cost), they are just doing their due diligence and the client is already halfway to our clinic by the time our conversation is over. There have also been many times I have recommended simple things to stabilize a patient for its trip over to the ER (think a fluid bolus, dextrose, decompressive cysto, etc.) and more often than not I am met with “I would rather just get the thing over to you”, even when our clinic is over an hour away from them. What are the major barriers here?Probably because ER costs have gone up. That sounds like a client declining a $6-8k surgery to me, which is why it’s so frustrating when we don’t get to talk to rDVMs, part of it is just setting up realistic expectations about cost before they even come over to us so we don’t have to bear the moral injury of sending home an obstructed dog on cerenia.I definitely hold a lot of empathy for ref vets, I know these cases are huge wrenches in your tightly scheduled days. Like I said, I try to run to the phone when it’s a DVM on the line, or if I’m in a procedure or something I just tell the front desk to say yes and I’ll call back for more details. But the refusal to stabilize does get me. That could be the difference between the patient getting to me and dying on the way to the ER, which I’ve seen many times.","Medical Doctor.

Alternatively you can use a [faucet](https://matic.supply/) to get a small amount.
2. Navigate to a DEX of your choice such as [QuickSwap](https://quickswap.exchange/#/) and exchange $MYST for another token of your choice.
3. Transfer your tokens to an exchange or on-/off-ramp to cash out. (Remember to check if they accept deposits via the Polygon Network) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/w0jpm4/selling_myst/igfja14/  You could try a [gasless swap](https://wallet.polygon.technology/gas-swap/) for MATIC.

You can bridge your MYST directly using *anyswap*. 
You open anyswap, connect your wallet and choose to bridge MYST on Ethereum to MYST on Polygon. 
To transact on Polygon you also need some MATIC for gas fees. If you don't have any DM me your MATIC (Polygon) Adress and I can send you some.

cassieface_,"Make sure to take your breaks. Get up and walk around, drink water, have a snack. The hardest part for me was just sitting through that many questions.I don’t even look twice at jobs that don’t post salary. Or at least salary ranges.I’ve been involved in gorilla procedures, general wellness exams. We had a human cardiologist, gynecologist, and dental specialists all come for the procedures. We also had an extensive team of veterinarians and vet techs involved in all aspects. 

Zoo vets are AMAZING generalists. They know a good amount about a great deal of species. It’s so incredibly impressive but they’re typically not specialized the same way human doctors are. For procedures that require this amount of specialization, we call in human doctors who have spent years and years studying this one aspect of medicine because humans and gorillas are similar. We also want them under anesthesia for the least amount of time, so having someone who does this constantly helps things go more quickly and smoothly.This is not okay. My first job out was overnight ER. I didn’t have any idea what I was doing, but I needed a job and they needed a willing doctor, so there I was. I loved it. And the reason I loved it was because my techs were so supportive. They knew I was brand new, so they encouraged me. If it was something I’d never done, they talked through how other doctors typically did it, they helped me research things, they gave me their thoughts with no judgement.  

You definitely need to talk to management about how these techs are treating you. It’s not right and it’s not helpful in fostering an environment for you to continue to grow. Even now, my techs will just ask for confirmation or gracefully discuss their concerns if they have them. And we can have a discussion on why or why not  their thinking is correct.I’m a vet, the hardest part for me is what you described as well. The actual patient, whether euthanasia or code, can be distressing or difficult but the hardest things for me tucking it all away and moving to the next patient. 

It’s okay to take time, it’s okay to tell your vet you need a minute, it’s okay to cry. I’ve sat in a room after a euthanasia and just cried for a few minutes. There is so much compartmentalization in our field, but it’s okay to take a little time to process before shoving it away to do the next thing. 

ALSO it is always recommended to have a debriefing session after a code so everyone can talk about what went well, what could be improved, and really gives you time to think over what happened.First time as well! I’m planning to do most of the week but likely will skip the 17th to do some Disney fun. If you don’t already have it, the app is pretty nice for planning your days!If you’re a clinical year student, the on site vet should 100% be available and happy to help throughout the entire procedure. It seems crazy to me they would leave a student alone on their first day at this clinic to do this procedure.I teach students, I ask them if they’re comfortable or have experience doing things. Even when they say yes, I stay close by or monitor the entire process. This isn’t your fault, though it does seem like you need to change some of your techniques and stop shooting for a specific time with your surgeries.Had to pass the course with a 70 or greater. If you failed the final but we’re passing the course before that, you could take a make up exam. If you failed that you needed to appeal to stay. The policy was you couldn’t fail more than 2 course total and past 1st semester you couldn’t fail more than 2 in one semester. People failed more, it just depended on the appear and everything.I do them occasionally. It’s impossible to do a thorough PE, give vaccines, and take blood in 6 minutes, worse if you’re double booked in that time. I listen to heart/lungs, check eyes, ears, teeth, and feel belly and testicles if they’re intact and recommend neutering. That’s generally the extent of my exam, and I write unable to examine in areas that I don’t get to. The clients get this information so they see if we didn’t examine something. 

The staff rotates and makes a big difference. I have worked with a decent amount of new or untrained staff and having someone who can’t restrain well hampers it too. I have had staff tell me that they have doctors who literally count breaths and take aural temps and put unable to examine for the rest of the PE. That’s not right to me, so I do a cursory exam with the time allotted. 

I have brought my feedback up to Vetco about double booking 6 minute appointments already and taking walk ins. It’s ridiculous in my opinion and they paid me more at the last clinic I did because I stayed almost an hour and a half over. I’m not sure if I’ll be doing more in the future because they feel poorly run most of the time.I’m not but I generally recommend owners follow up with a primary care vet for any issue I see. And that this doesn’t replace their annual exam.>Is it worth it financially and mentally? 

I’m in hundreds of thousands of dollars of debt. The school I went to was expensive but I knew that going in. “Worth it” is hard to say. I think it was worth it for me, as I don’t let my loans control my life, but my payments right now are very low. That might change in the future. Mentally sure, again I knew what I was getting in to. 

>How hard would you rank the education level? 

Vet school was the hardest thing I’ve done both mentally and academically. And it doesn’t stop with vet school. I am learning constantly every day. This profession is about being a life long learner. If you don’t love that, it’s not for you. 

>What characteristics would make you suitable or not for this position? 

Decent people skills. This is a customer service job at its core, with medicine thrown in. Obviously this depends on the area of medicine you’re in but I spend most of my time talking to clients, techs, or students. Patience is a good skill to have, along with resiliency. Some days will beat you down. 

>Lastly, what other animal jobs are there that are similar to this?

Depends what you mean. Practicing medicine with animals? None. Caring for and working with animals? Vet tech, zoo keeper, boarding facility worker, wildlife facility worker, etc. 

The big thing here is you need to spend some time around our profession to see if it’s for you.

Foolsindigo,"If your location is 2.5+ hrs to the nearest vet, how successful do you expect to be in recruiting DVMs? I think this is a great idea that would work much better if YOU were the DVM to ensure you’d have one available.

I’m not sure if you’ve seen the increase and subsequent failure of the PetIQ/Vip Petcare community clinics that have opened in Walmarts, Tractor Supply, and Pet Supplies Plus stores. I opened two and worked for the company for many years. At our rural locations, similar to how you describe, we couldn’t consistently contracts DVMs and the locations struggled significantly.We paid our vets $1,000+ per 8 hour shift but I don’t believe they were reimbursed for travel at those high rates. It was also strictly wellness and only covered very basic care - ear/skin infections, bloodwork. The clinic was incredibly basic with no in-house diagnostics outside of our microscope, zero imaging, no suturing or wound care. 

This was back in 2018, so I’m not sure what the per diem rates are looking like post-Covid. Even with the high rates, we couldn’t staff the most rural clinics with DVMs for multiple days per week. Several of the clinics closed by 2021, and several planned clinic openings were cancelled.

It’s hard to attract experienced vets when you can only offer a mediocre rate. It’s very hard to attract new vets when you can’t offer a mentorThere’s benefits to doing HVSN, mostly that there’s no continuing care. The patients you see that day aren’t your problem anymore the next day (barring a rare complication.) It’s hard to beat the work-life balance so the lower pay rate is acceptable. I’m not sure that your business model will have the same appeal.I make $22 with 10 yrs experience but not certified. Ideal schedule, other experienced techs, overall low stress GP and a good team. I don’t do surgery or anything special anymore. My clinic has two techs that enjoy sx so I’m especially unmotivated to jump in 😊 I’m paid less here than when I was in management elsewhere ($26) but I am happy enough with the other benefits that I can’t complain too much. I think the pay rate depends largely on where you live and less on credentials and experience, honestly. I couldn’t survive on my own without a spouse/roommate!My clinic also exclusively does payment prior to euthanasias. Usually the CSR or extra tech will go in and take care of aftercare elections and payment while the dvm and tech place a catheter and prepare meds in the treatment area. If CSRs are going in and acting like what they’re doing is wrong or shameful, the clients will feel like paying prior to service is a wrong or shameful. When clients call to book a euth, we have offered prepay if they know what they want so they can skip everything except a couple signatures.I don’t have a degree and have been in the field for about 12 years now. I work as a tech now but previous job I was also in clinic management and training.","Veterinarian.

extinctplanet,"I would say that GPA is more important than experience during that time. You can always spend more time getting experience but GPAs are often hard to change once you have a bunch of credits. A good GPA isnt necessary but, will make your path so much easier. 

Also in terms of experience, try to get some vet hours during the summers inbetween school and in a few different areas of vet med. At the least try to have both small and large animal.

Other than that enjoy undergrad and learn how to study properly. Memorization gets you far but, learning the why behind the material (esp for things like physiology) will make your life so much easier. This is very true for classes like cell biology and microbio where the topics in vet school build on these foundationsFor me I applied to internships on the jobs tab of AZA.com and then also on my local zoo’s website. I got an internship the next summer in their tropical forest and comissary departments and worked there 2-3 days a week doing that. After the summer there was a job opening and they couldnt find anyone so they offered the keeper job to me and I did that for a year. It was a really cool job but, I made minimim wage with no benefits so it would have been tough to pivot that into a career.Have you worked in a vet clinic? That’s your first step to see if you like the day to day job of a vet. It’s very different than most people think and comes with a lot of hardships. I was a zookeeper (wildlife caretaker) for a little over a year and its tough to make it into a career because we were paid minimum wage with no benefits. Larger zoo’s probably have a bit more options but, even then if the vets at the zoo make 100-120k ish then the keepers would be lucky to make half of that. Zoo’s don’t make lots of money and usually need lots of government support making most salaries on the low endIf you include the actual salary you’d get a lot more interestUsually its a super competitive internship then residency for zoo animals specifically! Was your school AVMA acredited, if so then looking for internships is a good stsrt, if not you’ll need to get licensed in the USIt doesnt seem like you have much perspective on vet school itself. You should not have to develop career and internship opportunities while in vet school if you don’t want to specialize. Vet tech school is different but, thats not what we are talking aboutBest course is looking on craigslist or walking into a clinic with resume in hand. Its entirely possibly there are liability issues with someone under 18 working so you may have to wait depending on your local laws. If you can’t get vet experience before college then dont stress, just use all the summers for experience and maybe a little during the terms if it fits with your schedule and then you’ll still have plenty of hours by time you apply.

If you find no vet experience then animal experience is part of the application too. Anything to do with animals (dog walking, helping a farm, pets, shows, etc.). So you can also get hours there in the meantime.Sometimes its simply a numbers thing, sometimes its the essay or LORS. For ISU you need majority of your hours to be large animal from what i’ve seen. Also the way ISU calculates science GPA inflates everyones so higher GPA’s have less sway thereThe best way is to volunteer or work in a clinic. There are many hardships in this field that you need to experience to see if its right for youIf you do biology then 90% of your classes and pre-reqs will overlap. If you do physics then you will do all the physics requirements then have to take pre-reqs that physics doesnt require but vet school does on the side. Physics doesnt require genetics, physio, microbio, cell bio to name a few so youd be taking these on the side and paying extra. For example the upper div physics classes you will take wont count on the app but, upper div bio classes will count for the app.Having a bachelors definitely makes you more competitive because you will have more upper division science classes that way but, I dont think applying with just pre-reqs is a bad idea if you have a good GPA and experience.

The best way is the way that will save most money before vet school so I recommend doing community college for 2 years then transferring and doing upper divs at a 4 year collegeSo theres 2 types of experience; Animal and veterinary. If you work with a vet then its veterinary and that looks a little better just cause its exposure to the industry (and the application is proving you know what its like). Animal experience is any work with animals with no vet present, this still looks great on an application but if you had to choose then do veterinarySurplus of vets is kind of a stretch. Maybe surplus of GP in certain areas but, we are definitely lacking in other areas. One big factor is location. There are no vet schools in a lot of states and that means there are generally less vets going to those states. For example the dakotas, nevada, new mexico, wyoming, etc. dont have vet schools so the only people moving to those states to be vets are people who left them for vet school originally. Adding schools to those states would help those local areas retain vets and help the states as a whole. Where my family is from in NYC there is a couple week waiting time for most clinics in the area so I would argue that there is still a need for more clinics. In addition more and more people don’t want to use corporations and seek out mom and pop vet services.Peabody DVM on youtube and the university of minnesota wet lab videos are grest for anatomy!I also heard vet prep itself isnt covered by federal loans so if you have to get private loans just for the pre program then its not worth itWhat i’m saying is you cant apply for federal or grad plus loans for the vet prep program. You’d have to do a private loan for just the vet prep program then in addition do the full federal loans for the actual 4 years of vet school on top of vet prep’s privste loanBruh…Walk into a clinic with resume in hand or look online at places like craigslist and indeed for vet assistant job postingsHonestly just take it day by day and don’t feel like you have to prove you’re smart. In reality its dedication and consistency that are more important. If you arent in college yet then you practically are starting from square one and could mold your path however you like. I wasnt a fan of high school either and I found out when I got to college that it was the consistent 8-4 M-F schedule filled with classes that I didnt like and once I had the freedom to spend my time how I wanted then learning became fun. The fact you’re in an internship program the summer of your senior yesr of high school shows you’re ahead of most of your age already. The best thing you can do is start getting vet experience as early as you can, even if its a few hours here or there cause experience beats everything.I feel like this isn’t super common because by time an animal is in Hospice/Pallative care then they are probably in pain and suffering and it might be more humane to euthanize then wait for them to pass naturallyI agree but, this would still fall under the scope of the GP. There isnt really a way to be a hospice only vet, unless maybe also did mobile euthanasiaThe most important thing is where you want to practice as a vet after vet school. If you want to work in the US then try to attend an AVMA acreddited school or else the process can be very tricky and cost a lot.I see what you’re saying but, a lot of this seems specific to vet school itself and even then every vet school is so different. 

The professors at my school are awesome and always treat the entire class like colleagues. As far as different speices we do a good mix of small animal and large animal but, we do lack in exotics which is a big interest of mine. I have found though that focusing on the main domestic species and then branching out later has been a lot more manageable than trying to learn so many species at once. How many people in your class and school in general want to be an Aquatics vet? It seems way more beneficial to the school to have another small animal research professor than hiring an Aquatics vet. Also being an Aquatics vet is awesome but, its very niche and there isnt demand if tons of people suddenly decided to go the aqautics route - like each aquarium has 1 or a few vets and besides that people arent bringing aquatic pets in that often and the ones that do only need 1 vet for their life.

What school you go to also plays a big role, at my school the pathology department continously receives seal, sharks and other marine mammals from being close to the ocean. We also have the opportunity to work with an aquatic vet at a nearby science center. Have you tried applying at aquariums or doing a rotation at another school?

No respect for degree or personal time is a common theme in general practice and varies where in the country you are. I would think right when you start doing Aquatics youll see a shift because the types of people to spend money on vet care for fish and marine animals are people that are passionate about that hobby and value your advice. Youd also have a lot of respect as an aquarium vet or you could work for the government and not talk to any public. I think this part will change drastically after rotations. The field is far from perfect in many ways and the schools are pretty underfunded which makes the journey really hard but, there are paths to happiness as a vet. You definitely dont have to give the field 30-40 years, you could do anything! Work as an aquatic vet for a few years then pivot and start an aquaculture business using your DVM for credibility and then you can build amazing aquascapes and look after the fish you put in there, theres lots of ideas!These imperfections would be addressed more readily if people shared what school they are talking about but, I can understand why they wouldnt do that. Every vet school is drastically different so nothing can be done if noone knows where to address these problems.You can still go into aquaculture as a vet and take care of the fish and maintain habitats. As an aquatic vet its gonna be hard to find companion animals as most people wouldnt do surgery on their pet fish. This was just an idea cause they mentioned they didnt want to work as a vet for the next 30-40 yearsIn a corporate owned clinic vets are paid a salary and have no control over pricing. $90 an exam fee was normal for my clinic when I worked there are you’re paying for a 30min slot of the vets time.

As for the ashes, people can get weird over that stuff. I’ve heard stories of clinics being sued for stuff the 3rd party place did by accident (group cremation vs single). It seems simple enough but, i’m sure they had their reasons not to do it.You can take the majority at community college but, some of the upper division sciences may not be covered. It differs by college thoughYes you’ll just need to make sure you have all the pre-reqs in addition to your other classes before you apply. Heres a chart of what each school roughly requires:

https://www.aavmc.org/assets/Site_18/files/VMCAS/VMCASprereqchart.pdfI dont think it will be a big deal, especially with all your other grades being good. I know a lot of people who got into vet schools with way more C’shttps://www.aavmc.org/assets/Site_18/files/VMCAS/VMCASprereqchart.pdf

This chart has the rundown of what most schools require as prereq classes (you can be any major). Its a few years old so check with each school but its right for the most part

Only a very snall number of schools require the GRE and even they are trending away from them. The rest require no standardized tests. A few schools might make you do a Casper interview test after you submit your application but its not something you prepare for.

The best advice would be to keep your GPA high and try to get veterinary hours as an assistant or tech during your spare breaks and summersYour major doesnt matter in terms of getting vet experience. Join your schools pre-vet club for unique opportunities or look online and you should find vet assistant jobs no problem. How many science classes do you have left to take? I would really try to raise the 3.1 because it might be a red flag that you were in a non science major and had a much lower science GPA than your cumulative. This is cause pre-reqs are what matter the most and serve as background for the stuff you’ll learn in vet school and the majority of prereqs are in the science GPA. With a science major you would have many classes included in this science GPA so it wouldnt be an absolute reflection of pre-reqs but, as an english major the only science grades you will have are pre-reqs so the science GPA will be important.

Schools don’t mind a gap year but, usually people jam pack their gap year with vet / animal experiences. If you had a gap in experiences that spanned a few months cause you were traveling then that might be a red flag. Vacations are fine ofcourse but if you take off a significant part of the year then not sure how they will look at that.

EngineeringNo1848,"Vet school with kids is so hard! My daughter was 4 when I started school, I graduated last May. I found 3rd/4th year rotations to be the most challenging by far. We had 3 week blocks so my entire schedule would change every few weeks with little/no notice as we wouldn't get a syllabus until first day of rotation and most professors didn't answer email. Plus the added stress of studying for the NAVLE, which I recommend taking a block off to study for if you haven't. 

I knew without a doubt I wanted to be a veterinarian and I still wanted to quit everyday for months. I am so glad that I stuck with it but it was the hardest thing I have ever done. 

Definitely reach out to counseling services through your school. There are options like cerebral that you can do online. I would reach out to your program director to see if a leave of absence is possible.

I have both vet and non-vet jobs and both are hard. My advice is similar to the above. Find good mentors and a good non-toxic clinic to work at that will have your back.I agree about the lack of social skills with regard to both people and pets. It’s very sad. Pets are not being socialized yet I had a boarded behaviorist say that they are not seeing upticks in pet behavioral problems (I think that has more to do with owner perspective than it has to do with not actually having a problem) and people who seem to be lacking general soft skills and patience these days. It’s sad.I was starting to see this trend in GP ( west coast area). Unfortunately I think the economy and inflation are hitting people.

I was worried when everyone was saying that we needed more vets and staff during that time that was immediate post covid era. Yes we were really busy during that time and burnout is real but I said that with the changes Covid made to the profession I was worried that it would slow way way down. Now I’m seeing that. I hope it changes.Is this vca?  Feel free to pm me if it is.How much longer do you have for school?  If you graduate in the spring I’d do everything to plow through unless the situation is really severe (ie threatening murder, rape etc.). Then make complaints after you graduate.

If you have another year or more then you might want to bring up to the university. I would consider going to the main universities student relations to discuss your options. 

I completely agree about the sad state of affairs that the vet field finds itself in now. It’s kind of always been an old boys club that says ‘well we had to suffer so so should you’. I’m not saying that’s ok because it’s not but those types of things have been there. I also do not condone the past and current behaviors of the vet field. I’m trying to brainstorm ways that little old me could do to change it for the better. Unfortunately the problems are deeply woven in the culture. Therefore I don’t have answers. I’ve gone to organizations (NOMV) who parade around suicide hotlines but IMHO do very little to change likely because the underlying problem is that the labor and student laws on the books are not adhered to. Just know people are here to support you.It sounds like OP was asked to do this every day off which I find unreasonable. Once in a while or even once a month sure. But this is why our profession has such turnover burnout and suicide. The idea that ‘I had to suffer so you should too’ should stop. We should take time to help the next generation of vets and do the training with dignity and purpose. Now I can see once in a while if an unusual surgery comes in during OPs day off and that would be a good learning experience. But learning spays on all days off when there are other ways to help OP sounds like taking advantage IMHO.Why are blood draws and IV catheters done in front of owners in the first place?  I would not work somewhere that does this as I’ve seen 40+ year vets struggle with non catheter euths struggle to find a vein.

I am looking to get into a couple of areas of vet med I never thought I’d go into. Anyways…my interests changed. 

However you are also a second year vet student. You still have lots of time and information coming your way. I applaud that you’re thinking outside the box though. My major advice would be to follow what interests you and do not be afraid to change gears even into something you once hated but now like. I do think that anyone in vet school and makes it through can be a good clinician no matter what some sourpusses say. Keep exploring and keep thinking outside the box.But you don’t have to be a clinician either. I probably could not go back into the clinic and be ok in life even financially (I think). I do have a PhD which helps. Just wanted to let you know that there are other paths. Also school and academia are not equal to the real worldBTW that sounds like an awful advisor.This is what I did.

Which-Dragonfly1265,"I'm glad to see colleagues who have an interest in this and think it is an important issue. Obviously it is complex issue and individuals/groups that have a financial stake in it often don't have the best interests of our professions at heart. Here are some other thoughts I have on the matter that I didn't elaborate on above.

1. We are a small profession. That means our educational institutions don't have the luxury to just produce veterinarians. That is, of course, the primary goal but quality institutions also support significant research activities to advance the state of medicine, train interns/residents/graduate students, perform outreach activities, etc. None of these new schools do this to a significant degree which hurts our profession. If a vet school popped up at Columbia or Harvard, I suppose it would be a different issue.
2. At some point, the expansion will lead us down the route of the legal profession. Tons of schools with only the graduates of ""top tier"" schools able to find employment out of schools as well as internships or residencies. Human medicine is somewhat insulated from this as the number of practicing physicians is limited by the number of residency positions NOT the number of graduating physicians/medical schools. I DO realize that a pedigree can help get a human residency but it is a different playing field. I don't know how dentistry is fairing due to this phenomenon. Are there too many dental schools?
3. The profession can largely blame the AVMA and COE for this situation. The first distributive was initially denied accreditation and in response, sued the AVMA. Mark Cushing was a part of that. The AVMA caved. Let me be clear, there are positives to the distributive model and if the institution also prioritizes research, training, etc, then they can be an asset. University of Calgary is a great example of this. University of Arizona could be one as well but they have their own problems (namely poor NAVLE scores).
4. Debt - Private schools that have distributive models don't try to reduce costs by not having a teaching hospital. They just charge the student market rates. This is criminal. Teaching hospitals are a MAJOR expense to a school. Do these new schools paying the offsite rotation hospitals an equivalent amount to running a teaching hospital annually? I doubt it. This is just compounding the problem of debt for our students.
5. Like many have commented, the goal of training DVMs to fill rural positions is ludicrous. This is a ploy parroted by the new programs to use as justification. Unless rural position provide incentive with higher salaries or loan repayment, solving rural shortage by producing more DVMs is not going to work.

What can we do about it? I don't know. There is a lot of money involved and key players in academic leadership (deans) and the AVMA stand to benefit from moving into the private sector and helping groups like the animal policy group. So they don't rock the boat. There is no money to be made for apposing it and no ones got time to do it. It has to be out of passion and love for our profession. But here are some thoughts.

1. Discussions amongst interest groups. Things like discussions on VIN, local and state VMAs, speciality colleges, conferences, etc. But there is also something to be said about having this issue blow up on social media, which is why the younger generation of DVMs is so important. I'm old and not social media savvy. Getting a post to reddit was difficult for me. But I've seen the power of ""not one more vet"" (NOMV). Maybe something like that could help.
2. Getting involved and being vocal. This can be with state VMAs, the AVMA, etc. Getting involved in the COE. Writing letters to editor for JAVMA.

FunConsideration3476,"Please don't feel like you're behind - clinics will ALWAYS be hiring and you're not missing out by not applying now. If you know exactly when you want to start working after graduation, just try to have some serious searching done 2 months prior. I had colleagues who did not start until April or even close to graduation, and I had colleagues who did not start looking until after graduation - all of them found a job with plenty of time to spare. 

  
As for interviewing during rotations, everyone does this differently. I used externships as interviews. Others did half-day working interviews during rotations or used vacation time. At this point your school people will be aware that you and your peers will be doing some serious job hunting and most rotations were fine with people taking a few hours off during some day, as long as it was cleared in advance.Female, VA. Small animal GP, 2023 grad. Base $115k with 21% production, 15 days PTO, $3k CE  with 3 CE days. Work 4 day 10hour shifts with \~1 half day Saturday/month. 401k with 4% match and generally great benefit packages. Non-Mars corporate.I graduated May 2023 and ended up choosing an MVP clinic and I have been very happy with my choice. They have been relatively hands-off in terms of how we are allowed to practice medicine and if the clinic does well then the support staff gets a big chunk of the extra profit at the end of the year. 

&#x200B;

I also received offers from Banfield (too corporate for me) and an SVP (Southern Vet Partners) clinic and the SVP offer had much more corporate red flags hidden in the small print and there was no focus on the support staff in their mandates.My experience with the mentorship program they have has been overall positive, but I do think this depends greatly on the doctors and management at the individual practices too. We are basically assigned a mentor, should have weekly meetings with them, and our schedules should overlap closely with theirs. The management at my clinic has been very focused on ""Do not drown the new grad, ease into things"" which is not the situation at every place. 

&#x200B;

I do know one new grad at a different MVP clinic whose assigned mentor went on maternity leave 2 months after she started and she was left hanging a bit. So really important to get to know all the doctors at the practice and make sure the ones who want to be a mentor are gonna be 1) around, and 2) really willing.","Veterinarian.

V3DRER,"Understaffing or poorly trained/ underqualified staffing leading to patient harm. There are lot of things we can't control in vetmed like client attitudes. The chronic staffing problems aren't something we should have to deal with, but most vet hospital are poorly managed. 

It's also super frustrating to have to (try to) explain and take responsibility for dumb medical errors that were made by someone else. It's a lot easier to deal with the consequences and repercussions when it's actually your own mistake.I second the medical organizer/ fanny pack to put everything in. 

1) Penlight (medical). Not a flashlight. 

2) Bandage scissors

3) Suture scissors

4) Digital rectal thermometer (the faster the better) 

5) Clippers - I have never worked in a vet clinic with enough clippers. These actually work really well, and are small enough to carry around.

6) Pens

7) Waterproof wrist watch or stethoscope watch

8) Hemostats

9) Stethoscope (big budget item - getting them engraved is nice). 

10) For a more unique gift you could consider a stethoscope cover. The greatly extend the life of the scope by keeping the tubing protected. I like these, compared to the kitsch fabric ones. 

[https://www.skopeskins.com/](https://www.skopeskins.com/)Another really important point for anyone on Pro-Sal. Understand in detail how your PTO works. Because the way that most corporates do PTO you are not actually paid for those days off.1) Most important thing is staffing. Do they have enough technical staff to support a new doctor? It seems like the tech shortage is even worse than the doctor shortage right now. 

2) Understand that pro-sal paid quarterly with no negative accrual = negative accrual for three months at a time until it is wiped out quarterly. If you use your PTO days you may not make production for the whole quarter. 

3) Make sure you understand how your PTO is paid. Do they lower your production threshold for the days you don't work?ER vets generally have a very flexible schedule. Typical schedule would be twelve 12 hour shifts per month. You might choose to work all those shifts in 20 days and then have 10 days free per month to travel. Alternatively, relief work allows you to set your own schedule and travel for work (a great way to build up airline miles). Both types of doctors are in high demand right now.I guess I'm going to be the outlier here. Unless you are super comfortable with working up emergency cases and performing emergency procedures, you need a training program. An internship is probably not a great fit for you. There are several training programs designed specifically to help experienced clinicians make the transition to emergency medicine: EmERge (Bluepearl), NERD (VEG). There may be others. These programs include not only an intensive ER-focused teaching and wetlab portion, but then a formal mentorship program. Initially you take a lower salary and the mentor gets some pay. 

ER doctors are essentially paid exclusively on production (base salaries tend to be ridiculously low). Mentoring someone for the 6+ months it takes for them to become competent in emergency medicine is time-consuming and negatively impacts their productivity. Expecting your coworkers to mentor you for that amount of time is unfair and creates a lot of resentment. Keep in mind that most ERs are severely understaffed and even with the best of intentions your coworkers will have very little time to help you. 

p.s. I suppose this depends somewhat on the type of ER clinic. If the ER sees mostly urgent care cases or is well staffed so the other doctors have time to dedicate to you, you'll probably be okay. If you are going into a true ER/specialty clinic that sees predominantly life-threatening emergencies and complex cases requiring hospitalization or functions as a tertiary referral center you are going to need formal training.You need to learn about the field before you can even consider these questions. Try getting a job as a tech at a specialty hospital. ""Neurosurgery"" is not a veterinary specialty. Neurologists are expected to see and work up medical neurology cases (such as seizures and meningitis) and perform surgery (usually spinal). Many of these same surgeries can be performed by board- certified surgeons, as well.Most of those are going to be incredibly competitive internships. Have you done externships at those locations? Have you reached out or made any connection with the programs? Are you a very competitive applicant? You want to be careful about ranking programs that aren't going to rank you back. 

What led you to pick these programs? What are your interests and career goals?You have to successfully earn a doctorate of veterinary medicine through an AVMA accredited program before you are qualified to sit for the NAVLE. Alternatively there is an equivalency program for foreign doctors to qualify for the NAVLE but I believe that process takes at least several years to complete.You failed every single course? Did some major catastrophe happen in your life this semester? Maybe talk to your school about taking a leave of absence until you can focus on school. If you have been studying, you are going to need to seriously consider if you will be capable of graduating and passing boards. I think you also need to find out your schools rules on how many courses you are allowed to fail, and what you will need to do next.Cornerstone is certainly not complicated to write EMRs in, but there is also a very minimal automation. The medical record system is basically a simple word processor. The clinic can set up whatever pre-populated template works best for them. Actually the clinic can make as many templates as they want, for example customized to different types of visits (i.e. vaccine appointment versus sick patient exam) or a different templates for each doctor. No idea why anyone would have cornerstone and not use the EMR part. What do they do with cornerstone?

As far as automation goes check out Scribenote. I haven't personally used it but the idea seems great and I've heard good reviews.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Anxious-Area-1723,"If you can make yourself, physical exercise will help. It's hard to get going but once you start you will feel better. I used to be very active but once I started working in ER I basically did nothing but work and sleep for 2 years. This past year decided to get active again because I was miserable and feeling much better. Feel like I have a life outside of vet med!I'm 3 years out. Flew out and visited for a few days, got a text offering the job before I got on the plane home. Took a few weeks to get the formal offer. Private practice. 

Keep in mind the recruiters are being so responsive because they get paid when you take the job. 

If you like the private practice better keep checking in. Also no problem telling them that you have other offers and don't want to keep other hospitals in limbo, but you need an official offer so you can accept and plan your life in a timely fashion.Second this. Work ER 10-12 shifts a month, make your money, enjoy life the days you arent at work. I wanted to specialize until I got to clinics (21 grad) and saw how miserable all the house officers were. And poor. I couldn't do it. Very happy making 200k a year plus bonuses and enjoying my life. I know that eventually the specialists will make more but not worth sacrificing these first few years of making actual money and enjoying my late 20s and early 30s.Sometimes open ended questions are good.

I literally passed out the first time I saw a dog neuter... like a tech had to catch me and carry me out of the OR and I woke up in the treatment area.

Moon_Raider,"A lot of it is people who love their jobs venting. Pay could always be better, that's a lot of it.

DanLikesColdBeer,"I'm also left-handed, and simply learned to use right-handed instruments. Most clinics won't keep both right- and left-handed instruments, and definitely not enough to do multiple surgeries in one day. I'd recommend learning with the right-handed ones anyway. When you're out in practice, if you decide you'd rather use the left-handed ones, you can buy them then or discuss with your employer about getting some.Definitely! Both of the other vets I work with are left-handed, but we all learned with right-handed instruments, so that's what we use. When I was starting school I had the option to get a left-handed needle driver, but it was MUCH more expensive, so I stuck with the right-handed one.Agreed that you should focus on getting into vet school first. Your interests might change a lot once you are exposed to different areas of medicine.
That being said, internal medicine is usually split between small and large animal. Neurology (at least where I went to school) technically does both small and large. But practically, they almost never see large animal patients. Very few specialties would see both small and large animals (radiology, derm, and ophtho are more likely to see both).I've used several different softwares. Cornerstone, Avimark, ezyvet, Vetware, and now Neo. I like Neo the best. It is the most intuitive and easiest to use. I use it now with zero training. It is simple to customize for each practice's specific needs. Having a cloud-based software makes it easy for me to check my schedule and write records or notes from anywhere. While I tend to learn the ins and outs of software easily enough, most staff do not. It makes my life a thousand times less complicated to have software that others can learn quickly too. 
We use idexx in-house blood and urine analyzers, and use idexx reference lab for any samples that need to be sent out also. The software integrates all of the results, attaching results directly into patient's files and sending notifications to the prescribing doctor automatically. 
Of the other softwares I've used, Avimark would come in second place. The rest are just not intuitive at all. I found they tried to incorporate too many functions that it made it much for confusing to do even simple tasks. The cost of some software can also be quite prohibitive, especially for small practices. 
I will say that my clinic has just recently switched from paper records to Neo. Despite knowing there would be hiccups and a learning curve, transitions are never smooth. Many clinics may not want to switch software solely because it is a HUGE headache. Not only in terms of having all the staff trained on the new program, but having all of the records, pricing, inventory, reminders, etc merging to the new software. It has been almost a year of working out all the kinks before and after going live with the new software, and there are still issues regularly.In terms of customization, SOAP and procedure templates are most important to me. I personally like that I can have a template for a general physical exam, a neuro exam, a cardio exam, etc. I can have a template for surgeries, so it is preset in regards to what meds I'll use and prices set based on size of pet. However, I'm an associate vet, so I'm not sure at this point what options would be most important for management/owners.

Switching from paper records to cloud-based is a LOT of work, because we have to scan the paper records and attach them to the corresponding digital record. Even for a small practice, that's thousands of records. If a practice is already out of the stone age, switching from one software to another would still be quite the hassle. It took months just to get our vaccination reminders to properly transfer from the old software to the new. There was a lot of lost time and things slipping through the cracks as all of the staff get accustomed to the new software.

As for learning curves with new software, I think that part of it is how intuitive it is. But a bigger part is probably that most of the staff in a vet clinic aren't all that tech savvy. I don't think that's specific to my workplace. A lot of people tend to just throw their hands up and admit defeat, saying they aren't good with computers. I can show somehow how to fix an issue and they will understand and be able to repeat that process themselves. But there are surprisingly few people who will Google a problem (or even search in the provided training manuals) and try to find a solution themselves.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

Now a little over 3 months later I've found my footing. I have no problems with catheters, picking drug protocols for anaesthetisia, giving advice and helping the newer nurses. 

The key to getting better is tackling the things that you find the hardest. I placed IV catheters in all the surgical patients every day until I got better.

It's not always a matter of volume, sometimes you need to prioritize efficiency when it comes to grades because there's so much to do and little timeIt's a better idea to actually experience vet school before deciding on these things. Before vet school I hated cardiac physiology, never really understood it and just sort of assumed I'd go into surgery because I'm good with my hands. I'm currently in vet school and I fell in love with cardiology, hematology, oncology... Surgery is literally my least favorite subject. I'm definitely going to be pursuing internal medicine as a specialty, and I would never have imagined myself doing so before actually taking the classes. Be patient, and explore before you commit to anything, and remember you don't necessarily have to commit to anything at all! You can be a GP and that's great as well.","Medical Doctor or Other.

Dramatic_Sun_4562,"Probably true. Maybe not official offers, with contract to sign and every laid out. But honestly, it’s not that hard to get an offer. Especially from a corporation. Clinics are desperate. The externships I did always told me “let us know if you’re interested and we’ll send you an offer”

But why does it matter how many offers you’re getting anyway? I decided on my top 2 clinics after externships, both gave me offers upon request, no interview required unless I had questions for them. I chose one of the two. Done and done.I’m a new vet, and I definitely could have been happier in a different career. I was the same way before. I had always loved animals, decided I was going to be a vet at a young age and never really opened my mind to many other ideas. Get a job a vet office and see what it’s like. Obviously you can specialize and things would look different, but most of us end up in small animal GP to start.

Vet school. The hardest part is NOT getting in as much as people want to make that joke. It’s hard to get in. It’s harder to stay motivated to finish. It’s crappy. There’s too much knowledge to retain, more than half of it won’t ever apply (but you need to know it to pass boards), and yet you’re still never really prepared for the real world. It’s so costly (I had really good undergrad scholarships, commuted, and only paid about $10k total, but vet school… $$$$$$).

Being a vet. The hardest part is not putting down animals. That’s what naive people think. That decision is hard for the pet owner. The vet is just there to provide the service. It’s actually sometimes one of the better parts. The hard parts are being over worked, not having enough trained support staff, dealing with difficult or uneducated owners, and not having work life balance. You can get great pay as a vet. But is it worth it to not have a life outside of work? No. Some days I don’t see my toddler because I don’t get home until she’s asleep. Sometimes you don’t get a lunch break. Sick days? Better figure something out because you have patients that need to be seen. Long vacations? If you even get enough time off, you better plan those way in advance. The good parts of the job— leaving on time (rare), seeing the human-animal bond, figuring out a challenging case, CE conventions and being with people who understand the high level stress job.

My advice? Work a a clinic, see the stress firsthand. That’s your future. Go to college, take random classes that peak your interest- photography? History? Earth science? A new language? Art? Open your mind and you will find other opportunities that will bring you joy. You don’t have to decide something this big right now. If you’re a science person, then you’ll take all the science classes that vet schools require. But don’t limit yourself right now.Get the accommodations and don’t feel bad about it. The test is honestly set up for people to fail. By the second half of the test, your brain is numb and you can’t think straight. Taking it over 2 days if absolutely the way to go. Also, it doesn’t make you any less of a doctor or give you an easy way out. You still have to know the stuff, and you still have to be quick with your answers regardless.It’s posted y’all!!I made my own chart for Abx.

Are you trying to connect to a node on your same public IP (for instance, your own node)?  That has historically not worked.  Switching to mobile data moves you to a different public IP, so connecting works fine then.  If you want to test that your own node is working, you need to do it from another network (like mobile data or public wifi at a hotel, restaurant, etc.). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xqf2ly/i_dont_know_every_time_i_am_trying_to_connect_to/iqczcmp/  If you're connecting to your own node from the same network that the node is on, why are you doing that?  You aren't getting any benefit from the VPN at that point.

If you're trying (and consistently failing) to connect to different nodes, then that's a different issue.  It may be that your ISP or router firewall are blocking something. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xqf2ly/i_dont_know_every_time_i_am_trying_to_connect_to/iqhubfy/  It depends on what your node is being used for.  I was top earner in the first month after main net went live, because I’m a US node on a gigabit connection, and people were hitting Netflix and Hulu through my node.  Suddenly, earnings fell flat.  At the same time, I started seeing content disappear from Netflix, and I was completely blocked from Hulu.  So, yeah, if you’re able to switch IPs, you might want to do it on a regular basis (don’t wait until the IP gets blacklisted, because then it’s just someone else’s problem).

Since I blocked Netflix and Hulu from my node, my earnings have been terrible, but I also don’t have to beg Netflix and Hulu to take me off their blacklist every month.

Also keep in mind that people have been using nodes to send spam.  My IP showed up on the spamhaus list a few months ago too.

So far, it seems like very little Myst traffic is legitimate; most clients either want to do something abusive or get around geolocation for content streaming.  I guess  I shouldn’t be surprised. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xeow68/should_i_change_my_ip_address_every_now_and_then/iojeru5/  My router (Ubiquiti Dream Machine Pro) gives me traffic breakdown per LAN IP.  Something like 95% of my node’s traffic was Netflix+Hulu. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xeow68/should_i_change_my_ip_address_every_now_and_then/iojqp9d/  I'm not saying it's not legitimate.  I think it's very much a good use case for VPN.  The problem is that the content providers (Netflix et al) blacklist IPs if they think you're a VPN provider.  I'm on a static IP at my house (for reasons other than Mysterium), so having my IP get blacklisted means I can't use those streaming services for my own purposes (and, once blacklisted, Myst clients connected to me also can't use them).

&#x200B;

tl;dr: The reason I block Netflix and Hulu is because of the blacklisting policies of those providers. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xeow68/should_i_change_my_ip_address_every_now_and_then/iq43nxb/  Assuming someone attempted to gain access to another computer on your network from your Mysterium server, that connection would have appeared to that computer as coming from your Mysterium server, not directly from the Mysterium client in NL.

&#x200B;

Now, if you are suggesting that someone, using your Mysterium server, logged into your router, set up a port forward (assuming your other computer doesn't have a public IP) to the other computer on your network, and then attempted to access it through that port forward, then, sure, it would show up with the Netherlands IP.  That seems like an awful lot of work to go through when they could have just done it over the Mysterium connection and appeared to be on your local network. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tgqjcv/network_attack/i16hvs4/  20% goes to the Myst team.

1) Having a residential IP in the US.

2) Having fast upload bandwidth (download is almost always at least as high as upload, so I just say upload here).

It seems that, currently, the vast majority of traffic (and hence, earnings) are from streaming video services that restrict content based on geoIP data.

1Gbps symmetric residential IP node is earning about 20 MYST per day.  I was making over 100 per day, but I think traffic slowed down across the board.  Note: if you have a residential IP in the US that clients are using for heavy streaming of Hulu, Netflix, etc., you may see that your IP gets flagged by them and no other streaming is allowed from that service.  If that's the case, clients will find another node (and you'll see your earnings drop). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sojaqr/best_way_to_maximise_network_node_earnings/hwehln8/  This happened a while back: [https://www.mysterium.network/post/mysterium-node-runner-settles-claim-in-germany#:\~:text=On%2015%2D04%2D2020%2C,copyrighted%20content%20through%20this%20node.&text=The%20Mysterium%20support%20team%20worked,connected%20at%20a%20given%20timestamp](https://www.mysterium.network/post/mysterium-node-runner-settles-claim-in-germany#:~:text=On%2015%2D04%2D2020%2C,copyrighted%20content%20through%20this%20node.&text=The%20Mysterium%20support%20team%20worked,connected%20at%20a%20given%20timestamp).

fijititis,"I'm 16 years old and as of this past year I decided on my career path. My big dream is to travel around the world and work with wildlife, specifically doing emergency surgery or surgery in general. However I understand that may seem unrealistic due to the competiveness of this career, so at the end of the day i'm keeping my options open. 

 I do have a long-term plan to help me move towards my big goal, however I feel like there is so much more I can do right now that I don't know about. 

So here is my current plan and how it's going;

1. I'm graduating highschool early, sometime within the next couple months. Due to this, I plan on starting classes at my local college until I can transfer to a 4 year university. Then, I will get a bachelers in bioligy. (I still dont know much about college, so any tips PLEASE give.)

2. To start off my career with some early expeirence, I volunteer with my local shelter. As of now I just work with the animals on the adoption floor, however soon I will begin working with animals post-surgery. Sometime around next month, I plan to apply to a simular program at my  zoo. Both will allow me to volunteer regularly for the years to come; because most places wont allow you to volunteer until your 18. 

3. Next week, I plan on applying to any jobs nearby that work with animals. I really want to start off in a vet clinic, however almost every clinic I have seen needs prior expierence and you must be 18. So for now I plan on applying to dog daycares, or something along those lines. 

TLDR; is there anything else I can do to help get myself started? Is there anything unrealistic I should know about my plan? Is there a chance i CAN begin working at a vet clinic at my age? please give your thoughts about it even if its rough.","Veterinarian Student.

phofighter,"Hi. Australian new grad here - I have relocated overseas but can tell you most of my classmates are making 70K-80K in small animal practice. A few less fortunate folks are on 65-68K. Corporate small animal clinics are were all offering low 70s. Mixed practice new grads with after hours seem to be on 75-85K. 

A mixed vet who is 2 years out is on 105K with no after hours.
A smallies vet friend is 3 years out, on 92K. Hope that helps.Just letting you know - the pay in Australia is MUCH worse than the US. I’m a new grad vet in Australia; most of my classmates are on $65-75K AUD. There was a thread recently about salary transparency; seems like the US salary is more than double, and obviously USD. But the big difference is that Americans have severe student debt, whereas if you’re Australian, HECS is a much more forgiving system. I will say though - the journey to vet school is uniquely challenging; every vet school requires you to submit evidence of animal/veterinary experience, and you’ll need extremely good grades from your last degree to be even considered. Feel free to DM me if you have any questions.New grad here. My honest opinion is, if you’re passing, you know enough. The first few years of the veterinary degree are honestly extremely irrelevant to clinical practice. I remember being in 3rd year (5 year degree), and seeing practice questions from a 4th year friend, and nearly having a panic attack. The further along in the degree, the more “clinically relevant” the content becomes, and it has a way of making you think you are lightyears away from your colleagues when in fact they are only slightly ahead of you in the degree. 

The other thing to consider is how long your colleagues have been working in clinics for; it makes a huge difference when you start seeing real life patients presenting over and over again for the same common things like skin/ear disease and vomiting/diarrhoea (assuming you’re in a small animal clinic). If you have access to patient records, read them! Try to grasp the vet’s process of diagnosis and their treatment plan. 

In terms of resources/books, are there any particular topics you’re concerned about? I found the MiniVet Guide (by Gerardo Poli) to be quite helpful, especially the Radiology Flashcards that you can purchase as an add-on. As you get into final year, I also highly recommend reading the ACVIM consensus statements for IMHA, MMVD, etc.

Best of luck!That’s a great idea. I would recommend signing up for a Plumb’s membership (it’s discounted for students!!) and reading up on common drugs that you come across in practice!In regard to vet nursing - it depends on the state. To my knowledge, Victoria and Queensland are a bit more loose with the term “vet nurse”. In Western Australia it is quite strict. A lot of larger clinics only recruit “registered” vet nurses, while smaller clinics may hire and train you as an unregistered nurse. I will say they are beginning to tighten up on this. You need to complete a Certificate IV (2 year diploma) TAFE course in most states to register, and it can be quite competitive.","Veterinarian.

LopsidedLawfulness,"Lol no it’s not. Maybe for pathology, but radiologists (and most other specialists) can make a lot of money. GP depending on location can be anywhere from 90k-150k typically as an associate (more if you own a practice or are in VHCOL). Radiologist can make many multiples of that depending on how much they work, but at least make double. Pathology is a different story, I couldn’t really comment on that. Likely a lot of them work for reference labs or universities in teaching capacities, so those likely have lower salariesLikely they are exaggerating, but from my experience:
1. Everyone desperately needs vets so I wouldn’t be shocked if someone is getting 10 offers. Probably a lot of them aren’t good offers or at least aren’t contracts, just “we’re willing to hire you”
2. Probably a combination places they extern at, worked before vet school, or they reached out to a clinic they know is hiring.
3. You don’t need 10 offers to choose from, I had 3 and took the one I thought would be best and it worked out great.

ERCalm,"I don’t do GP, but I agree with the recommendation. Remove digits if they become a problem to the health of the pet, it’s not being recommended for cosmetic purposes or for the health of furniture. Can it lead to other problems down the road? Possibly, but inclined to think less likely since they’re NWB digits and it’s not all of them.

People on social media like to think what’s shared is the entirety of a convo. The vet who replied was out of line imo. I rarely chime into posts to reflect on the DVM - bc we all know things owners say can be a miscommunication from what was originally said.

ETA: No different than a “happy tail,” that keeps getting opened and infected because owners can’t/won’t follow home care instructions. Or if a wound on a distal limb is bandaged for care and owners can’t follow bandage care regimen. Amputations are then discussed. Is it less than ideal that an owner can’t be compliant? Yes. But that long term only causes recurrent wounds to the pet. In which case, we work with what we have. Healing from amputation is less than weeks of wound care.Loving animals and it being a passion isn’t enough. This field is difficult physically emotionally and mentally. Surviving the field and thriving as a professional within it also comes with strength, self discipline, and self awareness. You have to be strong for your pet owners and your patience. You have to be strong for yourself, and know where your limitations are in terms of your knowledge, as well as how much you can put in. Knowing when you’re becoming burned out and what to do in those situations. 

This is ontop of being a good student to make it through undergrad, vet school, internship/residency, and staying up-to-date on medicine, even after graduation. I always recommend people look into other professions, that they may also be just as happy working in and keeping animal care as a passion on the side. Unless you absolutely cannot see yourself doing anything else and you recognize that the above information is something you’re able to do.Volunteering with animals has minimal responsibility in care and medical decisions. A veterinarian works more with the pet owners than the animals (compared to vet techs). As a veterinarian I spend most of my time practicing medicine (performing surgery, diagnosing based on diagnostic interpretation, etc.) and less time with patient care. It’s why I became a veterinarian- the medicine and puzzles more than patient care is what interested me. 
I regret the debt I’m in, and I think I could’ve been just as happy in another field. But not in a place to go back and change careers, if I was then I may consider it.Keep in mind her graduating debt is significantly less than what vets are making now.

paxbanana0,"Those are long, probably stressful days at work. You probably use up all your energy there and have nothing left over. Can you plan to take a day (or week) off? Even using sick time to rest and recharge may be worthwhile. I also recommend labwork just to be safe if you can afford it.I can only speak for my clinic, as a GP. I always do all of the above. The most important first step is making sure the ER can take my patient. I hate sitting in hold for 15+ minutes with the ER; the hold music is the worst. But it has to be done.I worked 8-7 straight today. I feel like we have remained pretty busy with intermittent days that aren’t as slammed. Seems like we’re making as much if not more than last year this time too.My worst experience was with a human dentist. I recommended a dental with likely extractions for his old small breed dog with Perio 4, and he told me that it’s ridiculous to recommend extractions for teeth with just recession. I told him I’d never even imagine telling my human dentist how to practice medicine, gave him the information for a veterinary dentist in the area, and declined to schedule “just a teeth cleaning”. 

I’d say mostly I don’t have issues with clients in the human medical field though.I’d be looking for another job ASAP. Talk to your boss, cite specific examples of hostility/abuse. Start documenting stuff on the day to day so you can tell them exactly what’s happening and when. If nothing changes, leave. You may find a better job offer in the process.No. Income based repayment makes it manageable, but your payment is based upon your income. You have to recertify yearly. As of now, you will owe income tax on the amount forgiven. So that’s 25 years of a mortgage payments that will not touch principal (and realize average cost of living makes zero difference on the payment amount) with a huge tax burden at the end. If you feel highly motivated to pursue vet med, at least have a plan in place, explore the best repayment plan, and deduct everything you can to reduce your AGI.It depends on the hospital. I’ve worked for Banfield for 7 years, and I’m able to practice medicine as I wish. I enjoy my work and think we provide good medicine and surgery for our patients. The benefits are good, the pay is good, and you have more options to move up in administrative positions if you want that kind of thing. There’re a lot of safety nets and backup because it’s corporate. Work place injury, covering for ER overnight because of a rare complication, etc, Banfield makes it fairly straightforward. 

My private practice experience was abysmal in comparison.Financially, no. 

If you’d asked me two years ago, I’d say hell no in all ways. But I’m in a good spot now. I make pretty good money, I can work extra days easily for good pay, and I’m never ever bored at work. I work with a great, non-toxic team too. The stress is manageable now too. But the first three years were hell; the first year out was all suicide ideation. It’s a tough profession, and vet school doesn’t prepare you at all for the reality financially or emotionally.If I didn’t laugh, I’d cry.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Freely_Sake9265,"I've seen just a few clinic euthanasia both for my own pets and for others as well as done quite a few for research. 

As someone trained in the vet field I was taught in school to always thank the animals we trained with. I took that with me and thanked all my mice when I had to euthanize them even if they weren't part of a study, their life mattered to me however short it was. 

My advice is to acknowledge your feelings in either setting. Like many have said, clinic euthanasias may be less traumatic than research ones, but regardless both should be done with the utmost care and respect for the animals.","Veterinarian.

As an aside to this and in real life scenarios, you will give diazepam/midazolam IV or rectally to any patient experiencing prolonged seizures as soon as they enter the clinic no matter what as continued seizures from whatever cause will cause brain and muscle damage, hyperthermia, potentially death.

--solaris--,"I think a lot of other people made some good points so I’m not going to repeat a lot of it. It’s never too late to consider vet med as a career and undergrad is a great opportunity to push yourself and make yourself competitive.

I will play devils advocate though. I am a second year resident and I’m burnt out already. Undergrad is 4 years, vet school is another 4, and residency is 3. If you want to do aquatic medicine then it will likely be another 2 years of rotating and specialty internships before residency. That’s upwards of 13 years of training ahead of you. Vet Med can be rewarding, but it is hard and long to get to the end of your training. I’m not saying this to discourage you, but simply to make sure you know what you would be commuting to. You have to be driven and always keep your eye on the prize. Be prepared for long nights, long weeks, and long years.As someone who knows people looking for path jobs in diagnostics/industry, this information is not current. Most diagnostic centers have placed a hold on hiring and industry has definitely slowed down. Also, pharma almost always requires a concurrent PhD.Some of these comments are absolutely insane and just speak to how toxic the culture is in vet med. For most of you, stop cherry picking what OP said in the post. If the technician is calling the other doctors by their last name/title and refusing to call OP by it then it’s not a lack of respect, it is active disrespect. As a technician, I would never have disrespected a doctor like that. As a doctor now, I would expect the same respect as my other colleagues. I go by my first name because that’s how I like it, but as someone who was once a technician, the appropriate thing to do is to call them by their last name/title at first and feel it out or simply ask the what they prefer. 

For those of you saying that respect is earned, OP earned that shit by completing 8+ years of schooling to get their degree (13+ for some of us). Did they know everything coming out? No. None of us do. Most of us understand that and are welcome to constructive advice (which I think it’s clear that OP is). What should not be acceptable is the nitpicking and hazing that is often given to new grads. There is a way to respectfully give advice. If you are a technician OR a doctor, this is a useful skill to learn. Technicians know things doctors don’t know and doctors don’t know things technicians know. Instead of belittling each other, they should create an environment where people are open to ask questions and share advice.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

Soviet_Russia321,"Anyone who's made it to 4th year can be a veterinarian.  You've got everything it takes, with years of credits backing that statement up.  It may be as simple as just getting through this current rotation and planning on never seeing these people again, since they don't sound particularly kind and the environment hardly sounds conducive to learning. 

I also struggle a lot with getting out of my own head, especially when it comes to certain tasks like catheterizations and blood draws.  I've gotten quite down on myself, feeling like a failure of a student and future veterinarian.  It seems like I fuck up the simplest of tasks.  When I'm deep in some trench like that in my head, I try to hold onto a particular memory of myself using needle drivers for the first time.  I was so awkward and bad at picking the needle up and holding it correctly, let alone passing it through tissue.  Something as simple as tying a square knot seemed lightyears away. I still struggle with suturing (still in vet school), but I can at least grab the needle pretty easily now!  I can even tie a decent square knot most of the time.   

There are things you do mindlessly today that once took real effort and concentration, I'm sure.  It all works like that, even if it seems like it doesn't.  It's a shame that we can only ever focus on what we are doing wrong, rather than what we do so right it has become automatic.  Keep your chin up and try to find a memory of your own to hold onto.  You're going to make it through this, and you're going to be a damn fine veterinarian.  The folks who weren't going to make it left the program sometime in the first few years.","Veterinarian.

Environmental-Key512,"145-160k plus super, depending on bonus for myself. 
No weekends, small animals. 
8-11 years out (got to try to stay anonymous out here!)

New grads on about 70-85k plus super

Recent grads after leaving their first job 90-100k plus super

3+ years vets 100k+, plus super

Care with places that advertise as salary package (includes super). In my experience they seem to be less likely to pay well and have an unhealthy perspective on what a decent offer is for an employee. 

Locums 80-100/h depending on competency/experience. That's usually using an ABN so paying their own super and leave. Most seem to be around 90. Some corporates pay on casual contracts $80-90 plus super. The pay depends on experience/memberships. 

I suggest accepting the fact you will need to move jobs a few times, progressively achieving pay rises each time. This is when you have the most leverage. 

Get memberships, they absolutely translate to better pay, particularly in high quality clinics. The clinics that don't value memberships, generally don't represent the cream of the industry anyway. Surgery is a great membership, imaging is another, GP memberships are decent (talking smallies here). Medicine is good as well but doesn't have the same revenue generation opportunity. That being said, you should study what your find i testing, otherwise you will be miserable during the preparation. 

The willingness to do surgery is a massive bonus, it's amazing how many new/recent grads either can't do it/are terrified to perform it. I'm talking speys/castrates/lumpectomy/dental. Nothing crazy really. 

If you are aren't tied down by financial responsibility (kids). You can work here for a year or so to find your feet, then travel around Aus locuming. You can often get accomodations for coastal rural placements, good pay and see some beautiful country. .

The websites where jobs are mostly advertised in Australia.

- Kookaburra Vets
- Vetlink

Vetlink is better suited to finding you a clinic that may suit your needs/what your looking for. There is more of a 'match the right clinic for the right person view. That being said, vetlink charges a massive fee to the employer, which may reduce the pay they offer. So that's to say, Kookaburra Vets may be more hit and miss and up to you to find a good fit but the pay opportunities will likely be higher. 

Some jobs describe their pay rates online, that may give you a guide. Note, the top pay is for people with 10 years experience and/or leadership experience/positions and/or memberships. 


Good luck and welcome aboard!You don't necessarily hate being a vet, you hate being a vet at that clinic. 

I know you have to say everything that needs to be said, but I think you know you have to try other clinics before you give up.

Don't project clinic based issues onto the career as a whole. You will become unfairly disenfranchised.Consider North America as well, if you want to earn a lot more money and get some savings behind you.

I'm from Aus as well, the NAVLE wasn't hard.No I never ended up going. I have 2 friends who did and they loved it. Both went to Canada and then 1 of them moved to the US for a bit. 

The money is WAY higher than in Australia. You could easily pay off your HECS and save up for a little travel. 

The downside is that the work-life balance in the US is pretty bad. At least that seems to be the typical story. Canada will pay a bit less than the US but work life balance seems better. 

Both of my mates came back eventually to be closer to home. They both came back with much more money saved than I had managed to save, helped them get a house and pay off HECS. 

They got to snowboard in Canada, see the national parks, camp in the wilderness and meet new friends. 

The cold was a big issue for them. They missed our summers.Yea I love it. Lots of people will be pessimistic in conversation about the veterinary industry. Honestly though, I love it and our income/life balance/career opportunities are growing so nicely. Best time to be a vet in history. 

Enjoy the journeyVery true, the nurses need more pay for sure, abysmal really. 

There needs to be a bunch of social shifts and economical revamps to the industry to see a change. 

Support staff in the US aren't exactly earning much in a relative sense, the ratios of vet:vet tech or vet:RVN are the same between nations. (Think approx $180k-200k:70k USD and 140-150k:60k AUD). The main difference is that you can survive better on 70k USD on average. However the radio demonstrates that Aus doesn't support their non vet staff any more or less than the US, the industry as a whole is just less profitable because an RVN is less qualified than a tech.

If they don't pay vets more they will continue to leave overseas. Improved veterinary standards were always going to come before the support staff. It's unfortunately how the economics work. 

The shift is now towards vets doing less consulting and more prescribing/surgery, that and insurance mentality will drive change in the overall pay (but ratios will remain the same).

Its such an odd industry as a whole. That being said, we are all better off than 10 years ago. Support staff and vets.Yea it's definitely a rose tinted view. I'd love to hear your thoughts on the US industry? I like learning about the other countries situations.","Veterinarian.

ScaredKale1799,"I’ve read similar comments from other veterinarians. In Arizona, we just aren’t booked out as far and can more easily see same-day appointments.

Unsolicited advice incoming - become a producer and your client’s favorite veterinarian. Don’t do medicine that doesn’t to be done, just don’t overlook little things. Doggie has a small sebaceous adenoma? Offer to remove it under local anesthesia right now before they leave. Needs a heartworm test? Get a wellness panel.  Have time? Chat with owners about the story of getting their pet. Be charming.  You’ll stay busy and employed.

FWIW, I’m employing a new grad and they are seeing 1 hour appointments. Work on getting your soft skills perfected during your extra time.Scribblevet - love it! We were early adopters and got the cheap rate, though I think I’d pay the full price now that I’ve used it for nine months and am addicted.Though please remember and either be thoughtful towards the practice or learn to hide it - mentoring costs the employer time, energy and money. And then you leave in 1-2 years. Try to sell me as an employer on the idea of investing in you!It won’t make a difference other than your contract will be contingent on passing. In fact, depending on your personal circumstances, ask if you can hang out for a week, get a good feel for places. Then, if you sign a contract, offer to start learning the system before your start date (you can’t practice but you can follow)- you’ll hit the ground running!What are the consequences to you if you leave before your 2 months?If one is “salary or production whichever is higher” and the other is pro/sal, then they are the same. A base salary and production on top of it. I guess I’d wonder if on the salary or production one, how often is production calculated? Salary is usually a yearly basis, whereas production is often monthly. 

All that said, unless you think the pay will be vastly different, you should choose on the basis of culture and mentorship.Well now, I’ve been practicing 25 years. 
My lessons:
- alcohol. Not recommended 
- overeating. Not ideal but it could be worse. 
- shopping. Eventually you’ll be able afford this I hope
- inappropriate outbursts. Sometimes helpful but not consistently 
- kicking inanimate objects. Very helpful, be sure not to hurt yourself 
- walking the dogs, rolling around with dogs, kissing dogs. Very helpful 
- feeding the hospitalized patients. Literally my favorite activity ever. 
- realizing that 1/3 patients will get better no matter what you do. 1/3 patients you can help. 1/3 patients will not improve no matter what you do. So focus on that 1/3 and reducing suffering in those we can’t help much. 

It gets better.I have to add my deep chuckle here because I was an intern at Friendship in 1996-97! Miserable experience. Not that anything is remotely the same decades later.I’d look at buying an existing practice first. Especially solo owners who don’t want to sell to corporate are highly motivated and may sell for property value alone. 

Or, start up with a mobile practice. Much easier. 

That said, for your original question, there are so many variables. It depends on the practice you want, how much you’re willing to spend on support staff, how much stuff do you need.For dirty math, I think 5 times your base is not unrealistic. 
Easy math:
$100,000 base

8 hour day x $250 per hour produced = $2000 per day. 

5 days a week = $10,000

50 weeks a year = $500,000.

In comparison, I am a slightly lazy vet with 25 years experience who grosses $1,000,000 per year. I average $350 per appointment in my practice, I see 3 patients an hour, but could see 4-5 if I wanted to work harder.I’m 25 years into being a veterinarian. 

Read this multiple times:
YOU CANNOT GET EVERYTHING RIGHT ALL THE TIME. We are fallible human beings. 

You will have days where you knocked every case out of the park and will feel AMAZING. The next will knock you back into shape. 

Just keep learning, leaning on those around you and forgive yourself for the hubris of thinking you’ll always do everything correctly. 

Oh, and find healthy coping mechanisms!!“This call is being recorded for training purposes.”

Sorry, but this is no big deal and is meant to help you.Stop studying. Do something fun and maybe silly (safe!) I’m picturing a roller coaster to clear your neurons. 
Then last review and rest. 

You can do this!It took a shift for me, as I’ve been writing records a long time and prefer writing to speaking, but I started using an AI aided speech converter called Scribble Vet. It makes a huge difference. I speak, it captures, makes it pretty and I copy/paste into my cornerstone EMR.

horny_reader,"If you are not on production, I would set up a time to discuss a raise that at least keeps up with cost of inflation. Each year they are paying new vets more and more, so know your worth and argue for it. An alternative would be some kind of retention bonus each yearI just left a practice like this. They had 4 other doctors, who were all variably slow. I had just started a few months ago and they could never fill my schedule. I moved across town to a practice with only one other doctor and now am booked out for 4 weeks solid.When I get a really cute chicken nugget of a puppy and get to show him to everyone in the hospital. ❤️Do you like it that way? How many procedures do you typically do and how much time do you block off?Gotcha. I have worked previously somewhere that had surgery time from 8-10:30 AM but it was NOT enough time to do a thorough dental or more than one to two short procedures and it was so stressful trying to be finished in time for appointments. I've also worked places that did an entire surgery day. Now I have a middle ground where I have a surgery morning then see appointments in the afternoon. I'm trying to find a good balance where I do enough surgery to be productive but not be stressed and frantic during surgery time eitherThey put me at the other hospital because of how cramped the current one is. Right now with me there are 5 doctors and only 2 exam rooms. Typically 2-3 doctors work each day. So it is very cramped, which is why they had me at the new place. I had also interviewed at the first place and liked it, so it was a good situation at the time.

 New hospital was supposed to be done by the new year but of course has had delays. They do expect increased volume at the new hospital, but at this point I think that is just optimistic guesswork, not evidence based.One of the other doctors did tell me that this is uncharacteristically slow, and the last few months is the first time she has ever not made production in her 2 years with the hospitalThanks for your input! Yes I'm going to see if there is some online training I can do in the meantimeI have experience with UVC and NVA. Overall UVC was way more hands off and the hospital had a much better atmosphere, though I'm not sure how much of that was just the individual hospital.  NVA has been a hot mess. Absolutely no onboarding of any sort for either of the two positions I've had at their hospitals. They are super involved in pricing, and you can really feel that they don't care about the hospital culture or their staff.I've seen new grads immediately start making production, and others are a year out and still not making any. It seems like a lot of it comes down to how efficient you are and your comfort level with surgery. Surgery is a huge part of most people's production. 

You're going to take longer to finish your paperwork and to look things up during your first year out until you develop a large set of cases you've seen before and no longer need to look up every detail, so you may struggle to keep up with your half hour appointments. You may also be loaded with wellness appointments as you start. That's normal and will pass! But keep trucking and definitely always aim for your production. Try to pick up some sick pet walk ins if you can or be willing to see a few emrrgencies. Everywhere I've been, as long as you have a full schedule and practice good medicine, you will make production eventually.I would try to negotiate for pro sal so you have your base salary, but if you perform well then you will get production. It's the most fair for everyone. It's a hell of a lot easier to walk into an exam room, say everything looks fine, and walk out than it is to go in, discuss wellness bloodwork, recommend dental cleaning and preventatives, etc, so prosal really incentives good medicine","Veterinarian.

rotten-cheese-ball,"I’ve taken a nationally administered exam before, they literally made me pat myself down before going into the exam room and put all my stuff in a locker except for my government issued ID, bestie they’re not going to let you look up answersIf you’re in NYC i think it’s harder since I’m pretty sure you need to be certified in order to be a vet tech (though I might be wrong). If you go to school in a state that doesn’t require you to be a certified vet tech, I’d say you might want to consider taking a part time job during the semester. If you can pack all your classes into 4 days, that gives you a full day to work and maybe pick up a shorter shift on the weekend. It can be a lot, but honestly, I’ve been doing that every semester where I work on Fridays, and I love the change of pace and it’s a nice end to my week. But if you do this, try to find a place that’s accepting/accommodating of students if you can. I’ve never had a problem taking time off to study for midterms or finals since my boss really values school and tells me to put it first. But I’ve had friends tell me how they had a lot of trouble getting PTO to take an exam that falls on a day they are scheduled for, even when they requested that day off long ago and their schedules come out weekly.","Other.

Busy-Boysenberry-435,"I think they could be lowballing you. You need to ask the clinic what they project your production for that clinic will be when you are out of the “internship” style start. Just because it is an “internship style” where you are being mentored and adjusting to being a new doctor, doesn’t mean they should pay you less than what they project you to produce (production divided by 5 is estimated salary). If you feel uncomfortable with 80k, you need to justify as to why you deserve more. What are your strengths you bring to the clinic? What is the cost of living in your area? What are other competitive salaries like for vets in the area? What is the AVMA average for your state?

 If they are firm with 80k, you need to have it in your contract that you are allowed to renegotiate your salary after the first year so you can be paid equitably. You also need to establish a firm time line with them because this makes me nervous as hell lmao. A doctor who runs his own clinic that I did a contract negotiation with said that how the market is right now, new student grads should not accept anything below 120k.Also if this is an internship for internship credit, it is higher than normal. But if this is just a mentorship period, you need to be making an appropriate salary (base salary or 21% production, which ever is high for that quarter)That’s fine but you still need to ask what your projected production will be for the clinic in order to negotiate a higher salary because while making “6 figures” is good, what does that mean? 100k? 150k? You need to understand where and how you are obtaining the salary in order to 1. Be paid what you are worth and 2. Have financial stability and eventually financial freedom. Idk what part of California you are in or if you have debt from school, but it adds up when looking at living expenses, utilities, loan repayments, car payment if you have one, pet supplies, health insurance blah blah blah. 

What else is in your offer? Do they include a uniform stipend? Paid CE? Paid time off? A bonus? Are they making payments towards your loans? These are all things this private business can use as a write off on taxes which saves them even more money.","Medical Doctor.

ThatGenericGinger,"Agreed. it does seem disingenuous when it comes to transparent and consistent information. Its like when the updates rollout and there isnt even any detail.... it just happens or your node falls off the network. There are ZERO project updates in the community channel. just random puff tweets and disjointed information.  


The payouts have seriously dropped in both number and value since the new year and its approaching the point where it almost not valuable to be running a node and sharing data/bandwidth (this bit needs to be addressed properly and especially this early onto the mainnet)  


My personal issue is with the ""1 node per residential IP"" and their main argument is the ability to burn IP addresses and state its for user transparency and halts decentralisation and then go onto mentioning ""Payouts have been cut because of this"" and this is only now just coming in. I would bet someone has been doing this long term with dozens if not hundred of nodes and has a whale bag and is now trying to lift the price now they have secured their moonbag. (\*\*this is a speculation based on information given\*\*)  


If you really break down the situation and what is being said, Decentralisation happens anyway, it just becomes slighlty clustered and anyone wanting to ""Burn IP addresses"" is either doing something illegal (which puts the honus on you as the node provider) or breaking TOS of a platform they are accessing by doing this. (yes we do understand the internet needs to be freely aceessible around government barriers, this is accepted) So this realistically comes down to not the kind of traffic you want to have on your node. 

  
Then finally getting onto the payment side of things, this seems like the main drive for everything to do with the upcoming removal of multiple nodes on IP addresses with a possibly disingenuous/bias reasoning, which means someone somewhere is pissed that they are earning less and probably have a whale account and have been milking it and expected more milk than sharing (which is actually the issue that destroys projects and decentralisation) and the primary reason the value of the crypto doesnt go up because its being dumped at a big rate somewhere.

Rthrowaway6592,"I’m a nurse but I’ve sat in on consults just to observe (I want to be a vet someday, bless my mentors) our last vet would look at the history sent from the other hospital or history that we have, and she’d just read and chat to the client to expand on info and verify and then she’d do the physical exam whilst continuing to ask questions/ talk about patient history! 

I don’t know if this is helpful so definitely listen to the professionals in this sub rather than me but that’s how I’ve seen it done!Thank you for the interesting perspective!Seems there’s always a time when it suddenly hits you that you are the doctor 🤣This is very reassuring! Gaaaah I’m so excited to start schoolYou’re going to do frickin amazing my friend! I don’t know you but I’m proud of youI’ll try so hard! lol! My old practice manager who taught me everything I know (she’s an amazing vet and person) told me that she still gets nervous sometimes and I’m like “but you’re so calm and collected” like I don’t believe it at all haha 

Thank you so much for lovely words Dr. Friend!It doesn’t matter what you have to do, just find another clinic. There is an amazing team and clinical environment waiting for you! 

When I first started as a vet tech, I had zero experience, wasn’t certified…I’m talking the practice manager thought I was well spoken and sweet and that’s why she brought me on lmao. 

My team in that first clinic is why I’ll never accept anything less in anywhere else that I work. They celebrated my milestones with me, and gently guided me and taught me, and were so unbelievably kind and patient when I made mistakes…when I slowed people down; when I expected to be yelled at. I worked hard but I was still a blank slate lol

You deserve that, my friend. You deserve more than that because you got your butt through vet school and you’re more knowledgeable than me 1000 fold! Find your people and get the hell out of that clinic! You are talented and worthy!I really wanted to say something as a vet tech but I was too tired to get into it.I started working as a vet nurse in a clinic to get a feel for vet life and I personally love it! As a vet, there’s a lot of writing notes, long hours, hard work, and pressure. 

I’d recommend just asking a clinic if you can come help out and shadow. Lots would love an extra pair of hands. I started a volunteer once a week just cleaning and learning the ropes, and then eventually began doing anesthesia, iv placement, med dispensing and draw ups, and then got paid for full time!AbsolutelyThe world would be a simpler, peaceful placeI was watching “cops” and as they were doing an arrest one of the police officers kept yelling “don’t you swallow it! Spit it out!”. It was a baggy of crack cocaine lmaoI agree with this, but I did hear about a vet who was breeding frenchies in either her house basement or the practice basement and the way my jaw droppedI’m a vet tech and make a colleague double check with me. Same with medication draw ups. Lean on your team, hon.

Ok-Jury8596,"Our clinic used to have ""away days"" for the associates. They were paid to spend the day with a specialist of their choice. Optho, surgery, whatever. We have a lot of specialists here (fl) that were always happy to have them come to their clinics for a day. I thought it really helped them learn new things and hone old skills.

Now they are so smart they don't need to, and it's a corporate clinic so they won't get paid. But still a good idea...Well, come for a working vacation! Or better yet, find a radiologist, invite him down for a vacation and an hour of teaching after dinner. Wait, start a continuing education program so lots of US docs can come down, vacation there and earn some CE credits. A new business for you!Average new vet salary is about $130k. Average school debt is $144k, and payments are capped at 10% of disposable income.

MDs go to 8 yr school, then 4-8 of residency. DVMs generally do 8 yrs.

MDs work an average 60 hrs a week. DVMs are working 3-4 days a week, 8 hrs, lunch and go home time assured.

MDs have an accountant on one shoulder, an insurance company on the other, and a lawyer on their back. DVMs never get sued, don't  have much insurance problems, and don't own practices so don't worry about finances. 

I'd  guess at least half the vets now work part time or locum, thus diluting their liability for continuous patient care. You start a case, someone else finishes it for you.

And yet we complain...

(I know individual situations vary,  but this is how the profession in general goes...) Cajun food vs UK uh, food? No brainer...Ha! I graduated in 1985 and it was the same. You're supposed to be ignorant, the attendings are supposed to question you constantly to show you what you don't know. It's  the process, and it works. And it's  part of your career - your questions should never end.

Never feel bad for not knowing the answer, only feel bad for not asking the question. Carry-on, grasshopper!So much speculation. Read the package insert. Call the mfgr.As a retired cranky old doctor, this is an interesting conversation. While I haven't read every study thoroughly, I  can say that the overall evidence against metro and in favor of diet and probiotics is, well, inconclusive would be a polite kindness. Don't  know which journal club article started this, so point it out if you see it as an outstanding example of good science.

As a clinician, the problem with evidence based medicine is that we seldom have good evidence, so are forced to use our collective experience guided by personal judgment, since we must treat our patients somehow. In the case of metro I claim superiority over most of the studies. Over 35 years of practice and thousands of various acute diarrheas, most of them followed to confirm resolution, average clinical significant improvement is 24- 48 hours, irrespective of diet, probiotics or phase of the moon. I recall two cases of toxicity, one a small dog and one a ferret. 

The rest of the non responders, and most of the HGE/ AHDS got chloramphenicol. And resolved.

So, in this instance, Sagan's extraordinary proof just ain't there.

Now, wanna talk about our inability to resolve otitis externa?  Therein lies a tale of intellectual hubris and corporate witchcraft...VIN is a requirement for new grads. Should be part of your employment package. You'll be able to ask questions of specialists, get opinions from a wide array of practitioners and professors, find data about most everything, protocols for any diagnosis, client education and a lot more. If you are serious about your career you need to use it, multiple times a day. Also your techs need access.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

barkinbeagle,"Research: Shelter/Rescue Medicine, Spay/neuter clinics, mobile veterinary, military vet med, lab/diagnostics and see if any of those might be a better fit. As others have mentioned try different clinics until you find one that fits your needs better. Perhaps just relief vetting for a clinic might be an option if you can’t handle a full stressful week? Do you have a vet school or teaching clinic near by? Check for options or opening there if you think that would be a good fit for you.Wait a minute…. You are being a very careful/thorough vet, you know your limits/what you feel comfortable with, you want to watch/learn/grown on those things you don’t AND you have positive patient/client responses?!? Hold on to that for dear life. You are what vet med needs dearly. Do not let a toxic work environment and shitty people break you.

Sqooshytoes,"I would not call myself a city person, but I definitely learned to love the city while I was there! Depending on your personality it can grow on you. There are still some things I miss about itI went to the university of Pennsylvania. I loved clinical year. It was hard and definitely long hours. I would say the issues I had were with specific people. One surgical resident (small animal ortho), and one large animal  surgical resident. The nursing staff were unbelievably helpful and would support and teach anybody interested in learning. The senior clinicians absolutely expected you to participate in rounds and expected detailed patient write ups, but they all were amazing teachers. I really can’t say enough good things about them. I’m sorry so many people are having such miserable and miserly experiences. Vet school is hard enough without senior clinicians trying to break students’ spiritsA very long time ago! 1998

We were responsible for doing midday and evening treatments on our patients, plus there were a few rotations where you had to do holiday treatments. I did find if you were respectful to the nursing staff and had a particularly heavy load or if big tests were coming up, the nurses would help with your treatments.  Some of the students who were less respectful didn’t get the extra help

My large animal rotation was the worst in terms of hours- especially bad because I’m small animal, coupled with some unfortunate timing of pager assignment 

I did large animal block all at once - LG animal medicine followed by LG animal sx. Unfortunately, I ended up having the pager my last 4(?) days I was there. Typically students don’t get paged, but my pager went off every night I had it. I also had the final presentation that had to be done our last day on service that I was trying to prepare. 

We had to be in the barns by 5 am, we had to do evening treatments (8p? Maybe 10?), but I also got paged for the midnight treatments, and paged for emergency surgeries as well.
That last day I got called in for a sx, was recovering the horse from said surgery, and the sx resident (one of the people I did have an issue with) wouldn’t let me leave even though I told her I had to go give my presentation to grand rounds. A senior clinician walked by and reprimanded her for keeping me there so long.  He told me to go wash my face and get to rounds.

I hated everything about large animal block. It was Jan-February cold and miserable. I think there is an attitude of hazing there that isn’t quite the same in small animal medicine. They also liked to be harder on us small animal people. It was generally longer hours than small animal, but the worst of my problems were the dumb bad luck of having to carry the pager back to back days AND getting called in.  No other students had gotten paged on their days the entire month that I was there(6 weeks? Again - long time ago) 
By the end I was awake for over 48 hours by that point and was not in good shape. But this was one miserable week in 4 years of school.

 Generally, I had a good time in vet school, I thought it was hard and I’m sure I complained a lot at the time (I’m generally a big complainer), but I had time to study and work (had 2 part time jobs to pay for rent/food , etc) and socialize and exercise and do things outside vet school. I consider myself a rather lazy person, but found the work manageable for the most part. I couldn’t do it now at over 50 years old, but at 21-25 I had even energy to get it all done.

Those negative experiences were unusual enough and bad enough that I remember the unpleasantness. I’m sure it wasn’t perfect, but for the most part, I felt like we had really good clinicians teaching us both in didactic and in clinics, and I liked my fellow classmates. Overall it was a good experience.  The worst part was the $135k in student loans upon graduation with the best salary offered was $45k. Most offers were in the 20s. The debt burden is what made me regret the choice to go to UofPenn, especially when I found out some people went to UofFlorida and got out of vet school with just a few thousand in debt. But I absolutely believe we got an excellent education 

There is another thread someone asked for good stories about vet school and someone currently at Penn mentioned they felt they had it pretty good.

***edit- in small animal I typically spent about 40-50 hours a week, ER rotation was the worst because you had 12 hour shifts (technically 12.5 hours for overlap/handover of cases)- we did 2 weeks in ER those were probably 84 hour weeks?  But I got lucky there with 7 day in a row all day shift, then 7 days in a row night shift.  It would have been harder if I had to switch repeatedly back and forth

Those weeks in LG animal did pull 84-ish hour weeks, and that last week was over 100 hours- so I won’t say that information is wrong, it just wasn’t a typical  schedule for me.  People whose concentration in large animal probably suffered a lot moreYeah, I definitely think there is room for improvement. I agree that stress and exhaustion are not conducive to learning!Is this a theoretical question?

The practice manager can influence/determine which medications the hospital stocks.  The practice manager is the boss/superior to the other associate vet, so is in charge of making sure the associates are practicing good quality of medicine/standard of care.  If the associate veterinarian were practicing questionable medicine, they could step in

Ther may be a particular standard or protocols that the hospital in general adheres to, which would fall to the PM to enforce

However, if the associate were practicing quality medicine but it were simply a professional difference of opinion, you would hope you could have a candid discussion about these differences, etc, and come to an agreement based on mutual respect for each other’s opinion.

If the PM is jus behaving like a tyrant, and is unwilling to discuss/listen, or is endorsing a standard of care the associate is uncomfortable with, then it is your right to quit/give notice, and certainly report the PM if they are suggesting inappropriate treatmentsI’m not questioning the veracity of your experience. Perhaps we could be more helpful with a little more detail into the problemOk.  The vet in question needs to assert themselves as the authority in veterinary medicine.  I had an office manager try to tell me the specific length of time my antibiotic prescriptions should be (because that was how another Dr in the practice did it).  They happened to be husband and wife.  I explained that I would continue to prescribe the appropriate meds for the appropriate length of time that my patient’s condition required.  

The same office manager wanted me to continue CPR on a patient that was past the point of return, after I called the patient deceased.  The first several years I worked there we had to have *many* discussions about who gets to make medical decisions.  It wasn’t easy, and required persistence on my part, but we went on to work together for 20 years.  It took a bit, but it is for you (if you are the vet in this scenario) to decide if you want to stay and stand your ground, or go somewhere else.  I would suggest using this as a time to practice some active communication skills; perhaps ask the PM what their thought process was, in case there is merit, otherwise assert your responsibility as the vet as the expert in vet medicine.  

If you are not the vet, but perhaps the tech that witnessed it, the comment stands, but the vet needs to handle it themselves.  You can encourage them to speak up, but this is a respect thing, that they need to address themselves. It seems more likely to happen if the vet is new/young/inexperienced/perhaps mild mannered vs a more experienced PM who is a bit more pushy. They need to talk and sort this out.  Veterinarians practice veterinary medicine, everyone else is essentially practicing under the umbrella of “supervision of a licensed practitioner”. This is the vets license and responsibility to make sure the patients are receiving appropriate careAgree with all your points

The solution to attracting more vets to rural areas, or getting more people in large animal is dealing with the expense of vet school. This also would help attract more financially disadvantaged people who find vet school too expensive 

I always intended to do small animal, but was also interested in zoo animal medicine.  Not only could I not afford to pursue zoo animal medicine (more loans/more time without a real salary to speak of), but taking a job in a more rural area was not an option either.  The job offers in rural Pennsylvania, upstate NY, and northern maine where I interviewed were offering in the area of $25-30k a year when I graduated.  I would have been in default even if they sent my entire paycheck direct to the student loan companies.

I graduated undergrad with no student loan debt. I worked through undergrad, and got 100% scholarship for undergrad tuition. I worked several jobs during (and after) vet school, to pay for general living expenses.

I only took out just enough loans just to cover my vet school tuition.  But interest on those loans accrued throughout vet school. So the end result is a final student loan debt that is 1.5x higher than what was initially taken out. 

As a result, I could only look at jobs in HCOL areas where I had family members that I could live with, so I could afford to pay these loans. The wealthy students in my class didn’t have to work multiple jobs in vet school, and they weren’t limited by money to determine where or what they practiced

If we as a society want more of any particular profession- teacher, social worker, nurses, rural veterinarian, whatever, the solution is providing appropriate education without crippling debt

The solution should NOT be lowering standards to get into substandard vet schools that are still charging extremely high tuitions/fees so that only the wealthier students can attend without suffering from crippling debt

Rural medicine has its other challenges as well, but cranking out more vets (possibly now under qualified) who can only afford to do small animal medicine in large city centers isn’t going to helpThis is it right here. Change your perspective. Turn away emergencies if you don’t have the staff or the mental space to manage it. Say no to anything you feel compromises your medicine or mental health. 

Let her fire you and then maybe you can collect some unemployment
You are basically untouchable at this point, so you can be firm about your boundaries.

Vet med is by no means easy, but this place seems OTT badYou are not a slave. When you tell the receptionists that you are not going to see the emergency, remind them that if they tell the client to come in anyway, they will be the ones who will be left explaining why they told the client to come down when there is no Dr available.  If it makes it easier for them, you can let the staff (and your boss) know that you can simply leave the building and not see anyone if they have such a difficult time with saying no to a client. 

You truly do not have to tolerate this. You are already planning to leave. It is unlikely your current boss will give you a good reference regardless what you do. There are no additional repercussions to putting your foot down.

Stay respectful to your clients, conscientious towards your patients, and proud of yourself for keeping healthy boundaries. Your boss is using your work ethic to manipulate you

You deserve better","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Yeah, I know what you mean, larger servers normally have redundant PSUs... With a solid UPS it must be very reliable. At least until a memory module will die and prevent you booting the server. It could be interresting thing to have Mysterium VPN in a HA setup. But generally VPNs (at least ipsec, which is not this case) are are not much resillent against outages.

SupaGinga8,"Depending on where you are, the amount of “hands on” tech work you’re allowed to do can vary. If you’re in a state with title protection, then you’ll either have to start as an assistant or consider going to tech school. If there isn’t title protection in your state, then I say find a place that’s willing to train you on the job as a tech. People get really uptight about title protection and uncertified techs performing that role. While I agree that you shouldn’t be doing things you’re not trained in or are uncomfortable performing, I do think that with the right training and environment you can get your feet wet and see what the field is like. Free continuing education is your friend! Find an area that interests you and seek out lectures, conferences, journals, even textbooks in that subject. I went close to 6 years as a vet assistant before moving to a state that allowed for licensure through my accrued hours of work and just recently got my RVT license. 

As far as the field in general, there will be long days. There will be emotionally charged situations with clients. Statistically, every single one of your patients will die before you do (assuming you don’t work with some crazy long lifespan species).

SprinkleOfWisdom,"Sure you can. I’ve worked with a small animal vet who then worked at the zoo a certain day of the week. So, you could work as an exotics vet and work with a certain zoo. Not all zoos can afford to have a full time vet. Also a lot of specialists might get called in to help at the zoo. Zoo vets are often huge generalists, so they often might phone in for advice from specialists - even human MD specialists. I saw that especially with primates. Possibilities are there, it just may limit some of your location options. The most important thing is to know there are options and focus on vet school, building good relationships, and trying different experiences in vet med. You may evolve your interests too which is great.I'm a veterinarian in the US, so while I don't know the details of veterinary school systems internationally, I can say with confidence, that I would recommend shadowing several different types of veterinarians as well as the other roles inside of the veterinary practice including on the business side such as the practice manager. Observe what they do. Ask them what they like and dislike about their job. What would they like for their career path? Ask what they wish they knew or had done when they were your age. Never put all your opinions into one person. Take what they say and apply it to what you seem to enjoy and your values. Have fun and stay curious about possibilities. :)","Veterinarian.

I'm not planning on sticking around here to find out….yes.Scores are up and I passed with 521 let’s goooooodiabolical move from ICVAA pass is a pass!Interested to hear why you have this take.I feel like from this, what you’re frustrated by is how people don’t all have the same ethical values as you. You can apply different ethical theories such as contractarianism/utilitarianism/respect for nature to the same scenario and end up with a vastly different answer for what to do. What makes one more wrong than another? It’s all subjective. Unless they’re actively compromising animal welfare or acting illegally, who are you to draw the line on right vs wrong for their choices?I hear what you’re saying. I want to pose something to you, though; all those students and vets who make their decisions intuitively are doing what feels right for them. They might do that to allow them to sleep (the best they can) at night or prevent compassion fatigue. Say the alternative to following their gut is using ethical theorems day in, day out to come to a decision which doesn’t feel right. And they do that every day. And burn out, leave the profession, mean the already struggling veterinary world is one less colleague fuller: because although were making choices that ethical theories stated as right, they felt they were doing it wrong. Does that then break contractarianism for example? Because we took the veterinary oath and then couldn’t be vets? Does it fail utilitarianism, because we prioritise our own mental health over the physical health of far more many animals? There’s so many ways to spin this. Generalising all of your colleagues as wasted students of ethics is pretty harmful.","Other.

Sea_Explanation6496,"They usually show you around the clinic and introduce you to the other staff members and maybe have you shadow someone for a bit. I have had one job hand me a worksheet that had common veterinary pharmacy questions on it (this was a vet assistant pharmacy position). Some of the questions were what does BID stand for, what does PO mean, a simple drug calculation. But I haven't had any surprise worksheets like that since that job. 

They may then offer the job that day or send an email with an offer later on. You can tell them then that you are excited to take the job but do have a pre-planned trip that you would need time off for. I don't think they would have an issue with the trip. They may also ask you at some point before or after the offer if you would need any time off for planned trips and you can tell them then.The ones I have seen are through smaller corporations or by a stand alone hospital. They seem similar to internships but are not through the match and pay better.The worst classes are honestly all of the ones in undergrad lol. I  am super bad at chemistry and the only C's I ever had in college were in Chem 1 and Chem 3. Once you get to vet school the most chemistry you will have is in physiology and maybe pharmacology but its not the same type as in undergrad where you are doing all of these stoichiometry calculations. It's much more clinically relevant chemistry that has to do with how organs function. I can't say that all of the vet schools are the same with how much chemistry they have but for mine we didn't have any true chemistry in our classes.","Veterinarian.

JoJrKvFanatic,"Straight from the A.I.:

1. **Attention to Detail:** Highlight how you were responsible for maintaining accurate records of animal treatments, medications, and billing information. This demonstrates your ability to handle financial data with precision and accuracy.

2. **Customer Service:** Emphasize your experience in assisting pet owners with financial transactions, such as processing payments for services rendered, explaining pricing and billing information, and addressing any concerns or questions they may have. This showcases your ability to communicate effectively and handle financial transactions professionally.

3. **Inventory Management:** Discuss how you managed inventory of medical supplies, medications, and pet care products, including monitoring stock levels, placing orders, and tracking expenses. This illustrates your ability to manage resources efficiently and control costs, which is essential in finance roles.

4. **Budgeting and Cost Control:** Describe how you assisted in budgeting for veterinary supplies and equipment, as well as monitoring expenses to ensure they stayed within budgetary constraints. This demonstrates your understanding of budgeting principles and your ability to manage costs effectively.

5. **Data Analysis:** Highlight any experience you have with analyzing data related to animal care, such as patient demographics, treatment outcomes, or financial performance metrics. This shows your analytical skills and ability to derive insights from data, which are valuable in finance roles.

6. **Team Collaboration:** Discuss your collaboration with veterinarians, other staff members, and external vendors to ensure smooth operations and optimal patient care. Emphasize your ability to work effectively in a team environment, which is crucial in finance roles that often require cross-functional collaboration.

By framing your previous job responsibilities in a way that emphasizes transferable skills such as attention to detail, customer service, inventory management, budgeting, data analysis, and team collaboration, you can make your experience in animal hospitals more relevant to finance roles on your resume.I didn't know she was a DVM 💀 And that's why I started off with my lacking credentials.

You need to practice. FOR EFFIN REAL. 

Common questions I was asked:

1. What are your strengths?
2. What are your weaknesses? 

GET THESE TWO DOWNPACKED. You need 3 of each for strengths and weaknesses. 

3. Give an example of a time you made a mistake. What did you do after?

4. Why are you interested in this position? 

5. What qualities do you have that you believe make you fit for the _____ position?

Do yourself a favor, go online, search for a online Pinwheel where you can input as many possible interview questions as possible. You'll have to type out each and every one but then once you're down- click on it and it'll land on a random question where you'll practice answering the random question. Do this as many times as you can until you feel comfortable and can answer confidently and appropriately.

My last advice to you is to dress appropriately, speak calmly and confidently. Don't freak out if you don't know an answer to a question, but rather ask for clarification if needed and answer the BEST you can.

Treat it as a casual conversation and remember to review your resume/application so if they have any questions about it- you know what they are referring to.This is really helpful!! Gosh, what a relief! I am extremely reliable and show up on time; I'm extremely dedicated and involved at school and with extracurriculars so my track record is clean as soap. Moreover, I had four dogs (2 passed recently) and they were all big dogs. I've had pets all my life and have been the main caretaker of them always; I don't mind cleaning poop or vomit or anything lol.

DrVetDent,"I'm one of those pesky 17yr old Scottish students who got into vet school straight out the gate, graduated at 22, and now in North America prepping for a specialty college board exam 🙋‍♂️ i.e. the root cause of your partners application problems.

Jokes aside, I want to highlight that your partner IS NOT competing with the UK high school students - each university allocates spots to UK and to international applicants (and in Scotland, some spaces for Scottish students, some rest of UK, and then international). This comes down to requirements from the government regarding university funding.

High school education in the UK vs North America is like comparing apples and oranges, unless your high school ran an International Baccalaureate program. We are examined at a level equivalent to year 1-2 of a North American undergrad degree before starting vet school.

Long story short, your partner is competing with fellow North Americans. And she is applying to three of the top 10 vets schools in the world (RVC, Edinburgh, Glasgow), which have ~40 international spots up for grabs/yr.

Best of luck to her, I hope that she is successful soon!I think you skipped over the part of my reply where I pointed out that she is not competing against UK students. The UK government requires that a certain number of spots are reserved for domestic candidates, while a certain number are open to international/foreign trained students. 

I went to Edinburgh, where ~60% of my year were from the UK or Europe, and the remaining 40% were North American. Unsure of how the allocation of positions has changed since Brexit, but anecdotally I've heard it's more 50:50 Domestic:North American. AVMA-accredited, so it was relatively easy to cross the pond. Non-AVMA accredited process is quite difficult and time-consuming from what I've heard.","Veterinarian.

doggg320,"All pertinent information of the conversation was put in the note, it seemed to be more so an issue of the conversation itself. It was regarding a pet with his first seizure and the owner had a multitude of questions.i was definitely thinking all bases covered, it seemed as though the issue was i mentioned medications? but my side is the owner asked about medications so of course i’m gonna document itthe tough thing is some of the doctors i work with write little to nothing. i’ve been there for over a year now and have problems with others not putting enough informationdefinitely see how they trigger question after question (feels like 1st time seizures and diabetes account for too many questions) the problem i have is at my practice a technician would have a conversation like that with a client (they just wouldn’t have documented it and therefore it wouldn’t be tracked back) a lot of our conversation was me trying to understand what was going on and if anything had happened recently, i was trying to calm her down for sure and assure her an answer could be found but it was up to the doctor they eventually sawdefinitely think bigger issue at play with those within the practice…. comments made to me about that note make me question everything i do nowi understand the structure portion of it completely but then i get made fun of for my bullet point/breaking up notes as well :/I definitely understand that, the issue at hand is the owner was in another state and i didn’t have access to the only doctor staffed that day. The owner specifically asked about a rescue dose and i told her it’s ultimately up to whatever Emergency Vet she went to but that some pets do get a rescue dose. Also a big thing was that I was being told I wrote too much and the receptionist who spoke to me seemed to understand that the owner was discussing a rescue drug and that i didn’t offer it up just becauseSomehow practice manager got wind of it, i was dealing with a very flustered owner lots of question and lots of trying to calm her downHonestly THIS helps me more than ANYTHING i’ve been told during my time in the current practice. more often than not i’ve been told my notes are helpful and most techs actually use it for history in appointments. a big issue is that the practice LETS the clients walk all over all staff memebers, i try my hardest to calm down those that are worried but also get enough information for whoever the note is going to (whether that be a dr for a call or even another receptionist 3 weeks later)","Veterinarian.

Clearly there are cultural differences between countries, region and clinics but you're not in an environment like that.

I would talk to the other doctors and find rapport and support there, see what the hell is up - if you have a medical director or HR please speak to them. If it doesn't improve, just leave and find another job. I've been in similar situations before and it is never, EVER worth the time.

akasha111182,"> (only females)

I think you mean “women.”Calling them “females” dehumanizes women by reducing them to their reproductive capacity. (And no, “males” is not ok either.) I understand that this is frustrating for you, but you need to take about seven steps back and look at how you’re potentially treating these experienced professionals if the first word you use for them is also regularly applied to dogs.At no point did I say this is about trans people? Or argue with OP, like, at all? 

Look, if OP is not interested in learning that a word they use doesn’t make them look great, that’s their business. And if you don’t want to understand the difference between female as an adjective and female as a noun, Google is happy to help. But given that Google search brings up 10+ articles on “why shouldn’t call women females,” I’m pretty sure your 99% number is off.You have an awfully expansive definition of “berate” (at this point, you’re the one berating me), but if you’re so completely unwilling to consider that other people may have different life experiences than you, I guess that’s your choice.","Other.

PancakesWaffles72,"Working during the school year is very doable as long as you’re good with time management. A lot of my classmates worked tech jobs, pet sat, or worked at the school. You have to be able to balance getting your studies/assignments done, work, and then make personal time for yourself. 

I’d say working 10-20 hours a week is a good balance. Start off slow and when you figure out a schedule that works best then start adding in more hours (start at 5-10 and work your way up to 20 if possible). 

Give yourself a day off so you can see friends and enjoy hobbies. Leave gaps in your schedule for something you enjoy between school and work so you don’t burn yourself out.It definitely depends on the work load for that semester and what kind of job you’d be working at. I’m able to do 20 hours because my jobs are not that mentally draining, I plan my schedule so I don’t work before an exam, and I work early morning shifts on the weekend so I can make some money and still have the whole day to relax or get work done. 

It’s hard because as much as you want to work, you’re a student first. I’ve definitely had times that I needed to lower the hours I’m working because my jobs were taking away from the time I was putting into school. 

I wouldn’t plan on being able to work 20 hours a week all the time, but it’s definitely manageable during some weeks and class schedules.","Student (Medical). Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Student (Medical)"" because it discusses the experience of a medical student bal",Other

I think for a confident new grad it would be possible to go into shelter med, there are also probably some few shelters that can offer more structured mentorship. However, the medicine you can perform may be limited by resources and therefore your medical abilities may not strengthen in the way they would in a more traditional clinic. All this to say, I think it’s absolutely POSSIBLE to go straight into shelter med and succeed but at least for me it was easier to go into GP/urgent care with the intent to get back into shelter med in a few year with more confidence and stronger technical skillsDo you have a bachelors degree?

I have limited respect for certain humam medicine people....I second Ross!!!!! I loved my experience on the island. It's just very overpriced. Clinics was at LSU... i hated it. All i can say is thank god ross sent like 15 of us rossies during my semester. Couldn't have made it through LSU without them. I liked the farm animal team and exotics team at LSU. Equine and internal med made me want to throw myself into the missisippi and consume the oleander they have on the campus. ER LSU peeps were great, too. I will say i did appreciate that they made sure we had adequate rest during my anesthesia rotation, which other schools didn't seem to do from what i heard from class mates.Nope, you are right. Davis has a bit of a poor rep om the vet side as far as culture.... def a few ppl with god complexes.... because it's UC davis.Vet here, i would say practice is almost uniformly better than acedemia. I think clinics at my school were almost unhelpful. Who can retain anything if they live in abject fear? I was suicidal, really suicidal and im still dealing with that to this day-almost 8 years after( good days and bad  days). Im am tired of hearing this. Vet med is already hard. I almost want to just call up the heads of the schools and just yell at them. If you're a rossie, report back to ross about this experience. Maybe they will stop sending students to this school. Its not the first time I have heard this about purdue. Im just gutsy enough to write a strongly worded email right now, just because your post hit my sore spot. Maybe someone can start a petition to examine culture on change.org. IDK....but i feel like we are turning into just another healthcare field where everyone eats their young. No... I refuse. If nothing changes, the best i can say is be the change you wanna be. Be good to your underlings when you are a fully fledged vet.And i will add, when i was at clinics. I had a resident absolutely destroy me for discharges (she was the straw that broke the camels back...terrible to interns...actually stated that interns shouldn't be handling advanced cases.... like you are supposed to be teaching them, you crazy resident?  When i say she made me feel incompetent... I mean it. Guess what... Im like actually a pretty good vet. And I mostly enjoy my job. Everyone gets their right rewards in the end.We expect that from clients... it should not be coming from our mentors and teachers... period. One should expect a certain lvl of professionalism from proffesionals.What about SAVMA? The student cet association.... if any one one is to be a 45 year old senator, now is the time to advocate for an issue.I think you are so optimistic to think that we have that much effect. I would absolutely up and leave because of reproductive rights. Pregnancy is 9/12 of the year, and you can lose your job or hours or money. And as some of us are breadwinners, if i can't abort an unintentional pregnancy... i would be screwed. This is not a pick you up by the boot straps thing. Or if its a medical issue... texas has made some odd choices. I agree its a great offer... if everything were true, but ill stick with my 130 k job is NOVA with great school systems, higher taxes, and reproductive rights. And omg so many international food options.You mean people are asking for what they are worth in the face of a changing world and economy???? Inconceivable!!!!!And LGBTQIA friedlier. Texas is like another country....it may as well be.....if NOVA changes (i doubt it will) - i would find a place that fits.Oh, you sweet summer child.... you think consensual unprotected sex is the only way unintentional pregnancies happen....Dude, it's just a state....no one cares.... since the days of thelma and louise....texas has had a rep. And you're so cute to think this information is just on TV..And yeah i can just leave... but a lot of women in texas cant...so its also a solidarity thing. Either way, you do you, stay in texas. Fight the good fight. Im too old, stagnant, and have too much to lose, and i think others are in that position. Dont go insulting everyones work ethic and lack of ""gumption."" 

Also, it's not just repro... immigration talk from the governor of texas is worrisome too. My point is that there are LOTS of reasons people are resitent when it comes to Texas. So many.....Oh honey, you make it too easy. I think everyone is questioning yours. 🤔Seeeee!!!! Point made. My immigrant colleagues won't go to Texas either. It's sad because 170 k is actually good...Pop an SSRI???!? Now you just gave yourself away. I doubt a real vet would say that (or anyone that works in a clinic). Maybe some sort of investor/pharma bro dude might say something so uncouth and callous ( your reddit is a giveaway)

And oh god...crypto....lol.Hahahahahahahahahaha. Okay Mr reason and Logic. I bet you are SUPER used to being questioned.... on a daily basis. An expert.Customers!!!! I knew it!!!!! Not one of us.

bredmlp,"I work for a large animal welfare org and there are several former veterinarians who manage programs now (no veterinary work at all). They are running programs to help street dogs in India, end the dog meat trade in Korea, stop puppy mills in the USA, get laws passed that protect animals and more. Also, many of the shelters I worked at had vets who quit private practice and are very happy now. The pay isn’t always as good as private, but if you have a heart for medicine and want to work with animals in a different environment, I highly recommend taking at look at The Humane Society of the US, ASPCA, Best Friends and other national orgs or your local shelters.Is the application on this different than the VEMCAS process?? I’m in my 30s, currently taking pre reqs (career switch) and NZ is my favorite place on earth. I didn’t know they didn’t require undergrad so this might change things… 😳Wow!! This is awesome, thank you! Are you doing your pre-selection semester in NZ?I am not a vet but I am going back to school to be one because of working in shelters for the last 14 years. I originally worked in a private clinic and hated it, therefore squashed my dreams of being a vet. Started working in shelters and am now going back to do shelter medicine.
You see some of the worst mistreatment of animals, but the transformations are incredible. If you can tough out the emotions, the rewards are everything. 
From what I know, you get to know your patients deeply after caring for them every day. You don’t have to deal with owners, only the politics of the shelter staff (which can be draining like anywhere but typically the medical staff is in their own world) 
The opportunities to travel to other shelters or go on rescues around the world are endless. You can help people who need help but don’t have the money. You will need to be able to do a lot of spay/neuter surgeries every day and treat a lot of parvo (from what I’ve seen). 
It’s low pay, and at some places long days, but high reward. The hardest part of shelter world (in my opinion) is getting to know so many amazing animals and still trying to convince the outside world that they’re worth adopting vs going to a breeder.Yes that’s accurate! To clarify, low in comparison to clinics/hospitals/etc. You can have 20 years experience as a vet and the pay will still be 100k at the shelter. I was just at a conference where they spoke about this being a problem.You’d get the standard 2-5% raises, I’m assuming. The growth is typically becoming the Medical Director. Again I am not a vet in a shelter, just giving the outside perspective! I’d ask someone else the specifics on raises and growth, or you could ask the ED or CEO of a shelter","Other.

Able_Stomach_,"Spaying can be a difficult procedure, especially for beginners. Here are some tips and tricks that you may find helpful:

* **Find a mentor:** One of the best things you can do is find a more experienced veterinarian or veterinary technician who can mentor you and guide you through the process. They can answer your questions, provide feedback on your technique, and help you troubleshoot any problems you encounter.
* **Start with small animals:** If you're new to surgery, it's a good idea to start with smaller animals, such as kittens or puppies. This will allow you to gain experience and confidence before moving on to larger animals.
* **Practice on models:** There are a number of surgical models available that you can use to practice your technique. This can be a great way to get comfortable with the instruments and procedures before you operate on a live animal.
* **Watch videos:** There are many great videos available online that can teach you about spaying. Look for videos that are specifically geared towards beginners.
* **Take a course:** There are a number of courses available that can teach you about spaying. These courses can be a great way to learn from experienced professionals and get hands-on experience.

I hope this helps!

Hi, after doing some changes and test, now I'm getting different errors in the logs (and of course, VPN client neither connect).

Updated docker run command:

```bash
docker run --cap-add NET_ADMIN -d -p 7500-7700:7500-7700 -p 4449:4449 --name myst -v /volume2/virtualization/docker/mysterium-node:/var/lib/mysterium-node --device /dev/net/tun:/dev/net/tun  mysteriumnetwork/myst:latest service --agreed-terms-and-conditions
```

I have to run wireward in another docker and link to the main docker? I found no information related to this...

Even just a card or a thank you letter can brighten my day, I don’t mind whether there’s a gift attached or not.You’re not being a crybaby. You’re dealing with a very difficult situation very well. This is not normal and I would say all this shouldn’t be expected of you. You should be very proud of yourself for how well you’ve managed and the positive feedback you’ve received clearly shows your ability to handle the situation, but that doesn’t justify your employer putting you in the situation to begin with. It may be worth requesting a meeting with your boss to discuss the situation. Tell them your concerns, tell them you’re struggling and request more support. There are plenty of jobs out there, it may also be worth looking elsewhere or emailing a few practices to see what options you have. The OV training is time consuming - if they’re expecting you to do it they should be giving you adequate time in which to complete it. It’s not necessarily too much for someone 15 months out, but it’s a lot of extra paperwork and pressure and it sounds like that’s something you could do without at this present moment. Contact your friends from vet school and speak to them - are they in similar situations? It may help to sound it out with others, and it’s a good opportunity to reconnect and chat socially. Good luck and remember you’re not alone, there is always someone to talk to.

meowfricky,"I’m truly surprised that some people are not understanding that it’s not how the techs necessarily feel about you, it’s about the lack of respect. 

I’d be feeling angry, in your situation. 

I’m at a tech of 10+ years. I feel like I’ve worked with enough techs who think that they know more than anyone due to their years of experience. I’ve also worked with techs who thought that they knew better because they have more experience in schooling. None of that should matter. 

You’re a doctor and they need to respect that. 

I kind of experienced something similar when I stepped in to a management role, with staff no respecting. Although it’s kind of nerve wracking at first, I kind of had to separate being friendly and being a leader and having the ultimate say. It didn’t take long for people to respect me after that. 

Perhaps in your situation, when the tech refuses to call you doctor, you could say “please refer to me as dr___.” 

Also- delegate. Stay on top of the techs to make sure they are doing what you asked. 
You can correct them, if needed too.

Sylvanas052218,"Choosing the right practice is so important. The mental difference between having a good mentor/other associates, competent manager and skilled staff is incredible. You'll never see that in an offer letter, but I'd take less financially to have it.Healthy treats (fruit, veggies, etc.) go over really well given the amount of unhealthy stuff that comes in!We're using ezyVet and I'm the administrator of it here at our (medium/large companion animal GP). It's honestly one of the MOST modern UI's that you'll find in PMS. It's pretty intuitive and what's needed to work with it has been something I've been able to train people ranging from those who need help turning their phone on to advanced staff members.

Now, saying that, the behind the scenes of it and troubleshooting can be a bear and if you're not moderately advanced in terms of understanding pick lists, template variables, basic knowledge of HTML, etc. you'll run into dead-ends which will require a support call OR you just won't be using the program to it's fullest.

Around a decade ago I was part of a team that helped develop a human EHR system, it never took off, hence why I'm here instead of on a yacht. BUT, it did give me the experience of helping create a system which helps me understand better how/why things are AND how to modify them to my hospital's preferred setup.

I've assisted at clinics with Impromed, Cornerstone, Avimark, Petware, Neo, etc. ezyVet's customization is why I still use 2+ years after implementing, I'll be starting a new clinic later this year from scratch and we'll be using ezyVet there too.

\--

The only/biggest gripe I have with it? The patient/referring vet reports I send out have very limited customization options and SUCK to parse through on the other end. Could be done so much better, but it's been one of those ""we're working on it"" features since I bought it. There's other minor things, but overall you won't do better IF you have an admin who's moderately tech savvy.Hopefully I can break this down without it being boring to read!

Visual management is a big part of my hospital's management (more of my background is I've been a regional manager starting/managing multiple branches throughout the US, but have since settled down to just my local area in the past few years as I was done with having to remember what city I was in each morning). From ezyVet to patient boards, travel sheets, cage cards, etc. we use colors/shapes to denote stages, demeanor, doctor, etc. so from a distance or at a glance you can ascertain a lot of basic information extremely quickly.

ezyVet is color coded and I've utilized the symbols/colors in a way on ezyVet that match up with how we operate in the hospital. I have TV's throughout the hospital as well which show our ezyVet schedule. At a glance, it's easy to look at the schedule and know which DVM, what type of appt, patient demeanor, etc.

So, it's 'intuitive' as it follows the way we operate within the program and throughout the hospital. Within the program, the tabs are easy enough to follow to find the type of information you need and there are higher level functions (ex. Records tab) which allow you to search or mass change items very easily.

\--

Troubleshooting I find myself doing tends to be from:  
Printer Issues (Dymo's are great, but fickle with it sometimes)  
Formatting Issues  
Templating (my DVM's love shorthand and templates, so I'm constantly helping build/format them to increase their efficiency and make better medical notes)  
Every so often some financial logging issues. There are some financial permissions I keep to myself, so some staff errors need me to troubleshoot.

I don't mean to make it out like I spend all my day troubleshooting, it may only be 1-2 a day. An example I just did was a retroactive discount that should have been applied based on a nail trim being mischarged. Retroactive discounts are something I keep as a permission for myself to prevent any possible issues.

\--

HTML knowledge helps with the templating to ensure the best formatting. They have a builder which simplified 98% of it, but sometimes there are specifics in terms of formatting whether it be checkboxes, signature areas, etc. that don't come out just right and I'll play with the HTML and can fix it. I've heard a decent amount of clinics being annoyed with how their invoices/templates come out because of the formatting issues if you don't know what to change.

\--

No thoughts of changing from ezyVet, I have staff and DVM's that moonlight at other clinics/ER's and they prefer ezyVet over the other systems. Every year it seems like I'm seeing records come across in ezyvet's format, our preferred eye specialist just switched over as well.

\--

I think having a tech-savvy admin is what can help you get the MOST out of your PMS, but I don't think it's necessary with most systems. You can get the basic and intermediate tools out of any system and make it work, but I think having someone to squeeze out that advanced part to increase the hospital efficiency and improve the looks of documents make a hospital look better to other facilities and to clients, as well as reducing unproductive time. I've gone, recently, to some other hospitals in the area where I know the admin's on Cornerstone and Avimark and helped with their IT workflow. Give and take, they help with some clinical stuff or supplies when needed, so it's all friendly.

\--

In my opinion only, ezyVet's the best of the system's out there, but it's not perfect. It's very customizable, but the downside is if you don't know what you want out of it or how to get there, ezyVet becomes one of the WORST systems.  
ezyVet's visual management system, wide customization options and increasing integrations (recently purchased by IDEXX) are amazing. You also get a steep learning curve and the need for someone tech-savvy to oversee ESPECIALLY the setup and preferably ongoing as they roll out new patches frequently which can mess with things.

Take the visual management aspects of ezyVet, marry it with some more customization options on clinical summaries, make the mobile version far better (for tablets especially) and boost the controlled substance reporting capabilities, you'd have something.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

champagne_puppies,"I have 349k of student loan debt. I did 8 years of school and two years of internships. Came out of vet school with no savings. 
My sister who only has a bachelors is making more money than me. 
So no, the pay is not “bad” but our debt to income ratio is insane, our jobs are much more emotionally draining, we do more than most of our counterparts in human medicine for 1/4 of the pay. And pay for our veterinary nurses is not enough.I’m starting my surgical residency this year. I was an out of state student at Kansas state and tuition was about 55k a year when I started in 2015 and went up each year. Plus I needed additional money for rent and living. So the actual principal of the loan was probably around 280k. But the interest rate on loans now is insanely high, most of my interest rates are about 6 -7 %. Since they’re grad school loans your interest gets compounded IN SCHOOL so over the course of the 4 years in school with compounded interest alone  was probably around 50-60k. Thankfully COVID stopped interest from compounding during my internships, but even now on my IBR plan, I’m not even touching the principal let alone the interest (7% interest on 340k is about 2000 / month) - so the interest keeps compounding onto the principle balance and that’s how you get fucked. 
I’d have to be paying 3900k a month to try to pay it off in ten years. 
Thanks for making me do math this early :)Yeah my life is fairly chaotic. I’m in a “surgical associate position” now and they’re treating me like a resident already. BUT after almost two years of ER and trying some relief GP shifts, I don’t think there is any place in vet med for me where I could be happy besides surgery. 
Fortunately I was able to get a little  savings cushion and buy a house (physicians loan FTW - 0% down) before a residency. 

Sadly residency isn’t in academia so I can’t apply for the PSL forgiveness 🫠. But I am on the SAVE plan now and I’m hoping the whole taxes on the forgiveness will go away at the end of 25 years. Or I will move out of the country is plan B 😂Why don’t you start with becoming a veterinarian first and then decide (if you’re not - but by the way this question is worded I am assuming you are not yet) . 
Assuming you’re in the US - any of them would require a rotating internship and residency. All residency programs in vet med are equally and extremely competitive, so you may even need to do additional specialty internships prior to residency. 
Once you have that exposure of a rotating internships you can decide if you want to move forward with residency training. 
It takes a minimum of 8 years to obtain this career (including vet school) and many individuals may change their career paths and goals along the way. 
Pay will be great for all but will vary depending on job location and academia vs private practice.","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it discusses the author's experiences and challenges related to",Veterinarian

Witty_Can_3490,"I'm at the end of a DVM/PhD program (epidemiology-focused) and I relate to your experience SO much. I felt so out of place in vet school, and it got particularly bad during 2nd year. It seemed like everyone else was finding their ""thing"" as the curriculum got more clinical, while I felt more and more isolated. I also had similar experiences with faculty telling me I should pursue the clinical route instead of epidemiology/public health. 

I think this is a really common experience among anyone who wants to pursue a ""non-traditional"" route in vet school. Vet schools are full of clinicians and academics, and they don't have great resources to help guide the ""non-traditional"" students, when (in my opinion) those students often need more guidance and support than students taking a more ""traditional"" route. Seeking a career in things like public health, epidemiology, wildlife medicine, etc. is a lot more amorphous than, say, trying to become a surgeon. And that's not to say pursuing other fields isn't incredibly difficult! I have the utmost respect for any general practitioner or specialist. I just mean that you kinda know what you have to do to get there, while those on an ""alternative"" path often don't. 

What helped me the most was seeking out better, more supportive mentors. Spend your summers and externship time exploring careers that you actually ARE interested in, and get to know the people who are actually doing those things. If you feel like you can handle it on top of your coursework, try to find a part-time job doing something that you like (research, necropsies, whatever makes you tick) - this helped me IMMENSELY when I was at my lowest in vet school. 

You are absolutely not alone, and you CAN do a lot with a DVM. Remember that vet school does not represent all of vet med. 

Sorry for the novel...this post really spoke to me and I think I have some pent up vet school trauma lol. Feel free to message me if you want to talk more! Also, other people in this thread are giving great advice - listen to them!I would honestly just google stalk people who are doing things you want to do and reach out! Most of my externships weren’t things that I had to formally apply for - I just emailed people and asked if they could accommodate students on externships. I will say that for some of the externships you do have to apply for (like the CDC epi elective), you have to apply pretty far in advance, so start thinking about that now if it’s something you’re interested in! But if you’re looking for something this summer, I would just start asking around. It may be hard to find paid experiences, so you’ll have to decide how important that is. Also consider ORISE fellowships! They usually have some cool vet-related opportunities, and some of them are shorter-term internships that you could probably do over the summer! Hope that helps. I don’t know where you are geographically or what exactly you’re looking for, but I’m happy to provide suggestions for places to reach out to if there’s something specific you want - feel free to message me!I think it's very smart to consider your options here, and I'm sorry that this has put you in such a tough situation!

Is there anyone you met while visiting Mississippi State who you'd feel comfortable discussing your concerns with, like current students? I think a first-hand perspective would be helpful here. I also don't think it's wrong to straight up ask people in admissions about diversity at the school and in the community, dealing with culture shock, etc. They accepted you for a reason! They want you at their school, and it's okay to ask them questions to determine if it's really a good fit - they're not going to rescind your acceptance :) 

Also, to answer the question in your post - my situation was weird, but I came VERY close to turning down an OOS seat in hopes of getting an IS offer the next year. I'm from a state with no vet school, and I was offered a contract seat to pay in-state tuition for vet school. Then about a month before I started vet school, my home state cut the funding for the contract program, so my options were to accept an OOS seat or establish residency in a different state and apply again the next year. Ultimately we ended up getting the funding back at the last minute, so I got my in-state seat through the contract program, but I was absolutely going to turn down the OOS seat. The debt was not worth it. 

I think there's a common feeling among vet school applicants that they should be willing to accept any offer from any school for any amount of money because they might never have another chance to pursue their dream. That's a really dumb approach. You're being smart and thoughtful about your options.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment was written by a person who is currently in a DVM/PhD program, which is a combination",Medical Doctor

I've had this kind of issues before, a node requires maintenance and keeping it updated is basic. Main errors are my DNS resolver for my node does not work so not even ping google.com worked, in my case it was because the symbolic link to resolv.conf was broken; other common error was ""couldn't find device ifb0"", which I could solve by scaling perms to some processes; some other errors I had were solved by simply waiting, restarting the node or restarting the machine (yeah, the classic ""turn it of, wait and then turn it back on"")... I currently have my node offline bc I use it for other purposes as well and requires some time to keep it up with no errors. So I can't help much rn as I would need to test possible solutions in my machine.Strict NAT (most probably strict cone NAT type) is not a good choice for this type of services. NAT comes from ""Network Address Translation"" and works at the IP level of any communication. The Cone restricted NAT won't allow translations through the same port of entry and exit (I'm not good at explaining this very accurately but you get the idea), therefore your clients cannot establish a stable connection and most of them will reject the attempt as they'll try to listen to the response through the same port they sent the message through.

So basically it is like me knocking on your door and you saying whatever through your window. I won't listen to you as I'm focused on you opening your door (or using the door phone) and speaking to me through that mean. I'll eventually give up trying after my timeout jumps even if you responded that I'm allowed to do the connection. The graphic would look like this:

.......[Your device]

\                same port (conflict)

\           [NAT]

\             /  \ different ports (cone)

\         [c1]  [c2]

When c1 tries to connect through port 40404 the inner device recieves that through any other port, if you are lucky (or have forwarded the ports to a range of portso) such port is listening to the connection and will send an OK through another random port in range. C1 will be listening through the same port 40404 and will have other ports closed or in use, leaving your response to be lost.

Now that you know this, the best option would be to use a Symetric cone NAT or a full cone. You can try binding the ports and allowing port forwarding, you must forward each entry port from n to n and vice versa for exit rules.


About securing your stuff... You have many ways to do that. Creating a DMZ, blocking specific ports and directions coming through your VPN device (such as incoming traffic from 10.x.y.z to 192.168.0.1 admin, careful with this as you don't want to be left outside to and brick your router, you'll have to reset it otherwise), etc. I have done that by a 2 level connection network. My first level is my main router that will lead me to the internet, then that one will be used as switch to create two subnets, one for my device with mysterium and another leading to a secondary router with a pfsense firewall in between. My secondary router can listen to the interface of my main router and my secondary subnet, however if you try this the other way you'll be blocked. 

There is no such thing as the perfect security, but I don't think you'll need more than that unless you are a multinational grade company with thousands of million dollar worth information. You can also use encryption protocols that aren't obsolete and that will be an extra layer of security.

Main errors are my DNS resolver for my node does not work so not even ping google.com worked, in my case it was because the symbolic link to resolv.conf was broken; other common error was ""couldn't find device ifb0"", which I could solve by scaling perms to some processes; some other errors I had were solved by simply waiting, restarting the node or restarting the machine (yeah, the classic ""turn it of, wait and then turn it back on"")... I currently have my node offline bc I use it for other purposes as well and requires some time to keep it up with no errors. So I can't help much rn as I would need to test possible solutions in my machine. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/193nx9f/why_does_this_keep_happening_to_my_node/khch5dn/  Strict NAT (most probably strict cone NAT type) is not a good choice for this type of services. NAT comes from ""Network Address Translation"" and works at the IP level of any communication. The Cone restricted NAT won't allow translations through the same port of entry and exit (I'm not good at explaining this very accurately but you get the idea), therefore your clients cannot establish a stable connection and most of them will reject the attempt as they'll try to listen to the response through the same port they sent the message through.

So basically it is like me knocking on your door and you saying whatever through your window. I won't listen to you as I'm focused on you opening your door (or using the door phone) and speaking to me through that mean. I'll eventually give up trying after my timeout jumps even if you responded that I'm allowed to do the connection. The graphic would look like this:

.......[Your device]

\                same port (conflict)

\           [NAT]

\             /  \ different ports (cone)

\         [c1]  [c2]

When c1 tries to connect through port 40404 the inner device recieves that through any other port, if you are lucky (or have forwarded the ports to a range of portso) such port is listening to the connection and will send an OK through another random port in range. C1 will be listening through the same port 40404 and will have other ports closed or in use, leaving your response to be lost.

Now that you know this, the best option would be to use a Symetric cone NAT or a full cone. You can try binding the ports and allowing port forwarding, you must forward each entry port from n to n and vice versa for exit rules.


About securing your stuff... You have many ways to do that. Creating a DMZ, blocking specific ports and directions coming through your VPN device (such as incoming traffic from 10.x.y.z to 192.168.0.1 admin, careful with this as you don't want to be left outside to and brick your router, you'll have to reset it otherwise), etc. I have done that by a 2 level connection network. My first level is my main router that will lead me to the internet, then that one will be used as switch to create two subnets, one for my device with mysterium and another leading to a secondary router with a pfsense firewall in between. My secondary router can listen to the interface of my main router and my secondary subnet, however if you try this the other way you'll be blocked. 

There is no such thing as the perfect security, but I don't think you'll need more than that unless you are a multinational grade company with thousands of million dollar worth information. You can also use encryption protocols that aren't obsolete and that will be an extra layer of security.

Ask more specific questions about this last part to specific subreddits such as r/netsecstudents or r/cybersecurity ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/18ngnnf/strict_nat_type_thoughts/keb6rcb/  Uhh... Never heard of this one. I believe some streaming services can block an IP if they detect it is a VPN provider, however this is VERY unlikely to be the case. Can you provide more details about this issue? Log message, error code or anything? 

If your IP is blocked you should get in contact with Disney's customer service. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/18fs6il/content_providers/kcxw66e/  Seems like there's a problem with the perms from the client side (your side). I cannot solve the problem with the current info (maybe someone that's more sharp with networking can, but I cannot), however I can try to make a trace explanation of that error.

Before I begin, I apologize if my explanation is kinda messy. My native language is not English and for technical explanations and descriptions I'm still pretty clumsy:

Seems like you cannot create an interface TUN, that interface is usually created by default by VPN applications. In this case wg (wire guard) is attempting to create a TUN interface to send the p2p request (similar to an http handshake request). Therefore the lower layer (transport) cannot establish the connection to attempt the handshake and finally establish an application level communication.

The important thing here goes with the interface. An interface is like a ""tag"" or the ""name"" that a device gives to a certain connection. Let's say that is like areas with their own ""traffic laws"". Each interface will be able to communicate with other interfaces with certain restrictions or won't be able to do so. The two most common interfaces are LAN (local area network) and WAN (wide-area network). LAN is supposed to be your ""trusted"" interface, you trust whoever is in your house with your router because you much likely know them. Hence LAN users can ping to each other and ping the other interfaces such as WAN. This is a terrible explanation but it works for you to understand what interfaces are for. They are restricted areas for your devices and you can set the rules from each interface.

Ok now TUN interfaces. Those are interfaces usually generated by VPN programs to set certain rules like ""hey, this is a tunnel interface, no one is allowed to send nor receive information from this interface except for you and the peer"" (peer 2 peer, only both ends will be able to receive and transfer data, with asymmetric encryption that doesn't allow one peer to ""snoop"" what the other peer is sending, therefore your data will be encrypted even for the other peer, and vice-versa). It's an interface that has certain rules to allow the VPN connection. If those rules are not set then the peer will reject your connection as you are sending a normal internet connection to a VPN peer. So if your device is not allowed to create interfaces or the mysterium app doesn't have enough perms to create the TUN interface you'll be rejected by every node. 

You'll either have to configure a TUN0 interface manually or give perms to the specific user/application/device. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/14if2b6/this_error_message_is_being_displayed_whenever_i/jpgezek/  Then the problem is the other peer. The node might not be well configured or not enough connections could be made before it reached a time out. That's my guess ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/14if2b6/this_error_message_is_being_displayed_whenever_i/jpgkkhj/  There are several ways to control network traffic. I believe there's a whitelisting option in the node options. However you can have even more control over this. Using traffic rules in your router and networking your LAN side traffic. 

For example, I don't want people to have access to my LAN side clients and I don't want them to ping my broadcast to see what clients are up. You can either block ICMP packets from your node and/or create two separate networks and setting the routing table so that only your ""LAN_trusted"" network has access to your ""LAN_node"" network but not the other way around, with this you can access your node via ssh (always recommend to use PSK auth if you leave ssh open). In my configuration I have two subnets and I block any connection from ""LAN_node"" side to my LAN and also any TCP connection to sensible ports, for example: DENY INCOMMING FROM 192.168.0.240 TO 192.168.0.1 PROTO tcp -p 80. This denies traffic from my node in 192.268.0.240 to the admin page of the router at http://192.168.0.1/ (is a fictional private IP, my node is not at that address and my priv IP for my router is not the default gateway 192.168.0.1). For obvious reasons I don't want external traffic to be able to access my router admin settings trying to get my user and password.

Once LAN side is properly secured you can use rules to block unwanted webpages or use the router settings for only whitelisted traffic (many routers have this option and use blocklists to avoid unwanted traffic) also using s good blocker and firewall such as piHole or pfsense helps a lot. piHole can be used as your DNS and you can add as many rules as you want to it. It's unlikely that mysterium whitelist fails to contain such traffic, but if it does so you'll have many options to control what goes in and out your network. 

If there's something you don't understand or that you don't know how to configure just reply and I'll do my best to try to explain it with more detail. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/137fcnb/new_to_this_i_just_wanna_have_reassurance_and/jloxjse/","The provided comment is from a Reddit thread in the subreddit r/MysteriumNetwork, and it appears to be discussing various issues related to the",Other
rebelashrunner,"I'm a 27f vet tech and am on the pre-vet track. I have a tattoo on my left wrist, where it is very visible to clients. Hasn't been an issue at all. 

I also have plans for a memorial tattoo set for my heart cat and my two childhood cats (as well as any other pets I've got in the present or future), that will likely end up being a full sleeve over time.

My bosses are part of the older generation of vets (90s grads), and they definitely asked me about my tattoo and its significance in my interview, and occasionally older clients ask about it as well, but overall it's very accepted and comments are usually few and far between, and never negative. Several of my coworkers (closer to my age or younger) have more tattoos than I do, and it has generally never been an issue.

If you're uncomfortable with/concerned about being up front about it in vet school interviews, you can always keep it covered (by a long sleeved blazer or something similar) throughout the interview/touring process. But once you're past the interview stages and in school and in the professional world, it shouldn't be an issue as long as it's not a face tattoo, which is generally still stigmatized more than anywhere else.","Veterinarian.

Suspicious-Treat-364,"Bravo! The entire vet higher educational system needs reforming. My classmates and I were abused pretty regularly and sleep deprivation was really common. I remember being yelled at by an anesthesia tech because I was having trouble functioning on no sleep at 4 am during a colic surgery. I had literally been up for 23 hours. She only came in for overnight emergencies and didn't have to work the next day. I was required to stay on until 6 pm that day and perform at 100%. I got reamed by clinicians for being exhausted and had residents try to force me to do things that would mean I automatically a rotation. The abuse just rolled downhill from the clinicians down.I lived and worked in a rural area for years. The problem is that people want EMERGENCY vet services and not routine. They want to vaccinate and deworm their whole herd and just have someone available for a C-section or DA. I had few goat clients despite a large population of them because people would say they're worth $50 and wouldn't pay a cent more for care. My practice would lose money just driving there and doing an exam. And that's if you can convince someone they want to live somewhere their spouse can't find a well paying job.


Small animal isn't much better. We pay human med prices for our drugs and supplies. We don't get a discount because the profit margins are thinner.

[Proposal 145, VPA](https://leg.colorado.gov/content/establish-qualifications-and-registration-veterinary-professional-associate)

> ""There are vet technicians that have mostly a two-year associate's degree, and then there are doctors of veterinary care that have 8-plus years of education. And nothing in between,"" Steele said. ""So we're trying to open it up so people can get more care.""

The VPA role (Veterinary Professional Associate) seem interesting, like a Nurse Practitioner for human medicine, I believe. This could provide a lot of staffing relief I bet, but I can imagine it could affect the demands for DVMs.Not a vet, but rather a spouse of one. I returned to school myself for engineering at 30, after a decade of technician work. It was the best move I did for my career, especially as I was able to land a career job after an internship while being a student. Quite a few of my partner's vet school classmates are in their mid, late 30's when they began school so it's very much possible.

The biggest hurdle I'd assume, would be getting accepted into Veterinary school, but once you're in, it's doable! You'll need a strong and convincing application package, admissions is VERY competitive simply due to the limited number of Veterinary schools compared to other professions. Work experience can definitely contribute to the admission requirements.

If you haven't done undergrad yet, then yea, getting your bachelor's first will make a huge difference with vet school admission regardless.

I'd say in summary: you'll likely know your answer when you get accepted or rejected into the vet school(s) you apply to. Or start with a bachelor's degree in a preferred, related major first.My partner has their NAVLE score out just now (~1:30pm Eastern Jan. 17th) from the CVMA NEB website (OVC/Guelph/Canada).

FrannyZoey8,"This is a rotten situation for you to have to endure. It’s hard enough to do the vet work all day without the worries of the support staff not doing their basic job.

Is it on you? Yes, in the sense that if a board or insurance complaint ever happens…..you are the one responsible for documentation of the case. I don’t think it’s on you, however, to have to enforce what the owner should. Medical records are legal documents; I weigh the owner took it more seriously.

You mentioned there’s an office manager-you’re doing the right thing by communicating with her; maybe the legwork she will have to do, along with your dissatisfaction with the current system, will get the owner’s attention.

What kind of system are you using? I’m assuming it’s paperless-can’t they just enter them then and there? 

Could you alter you schedule so that you have the last hour (never works!🤣), the first hour, or lunch, to catch up on paperwork? Could you have a more serious sit-down with powers that be? Explain why this inattentive behavior is not profitable? Not conducive to an efficient workplace with good communication? Maybe you haven’t made it clear enough? You shouldn’t really have to-it’s an untenable situation.Thank you for suggesting positivity!I’m also an owner, and have a similar outlook. Our assistants start at $18-the head tech is at $27. I heavily discount care as well, and like you, try to be really flexible. We started giving a $300 month healthcare stipend; they can use it as they please. One great idea my friend has who owns a specialty hospital is to pay for pet insurance for each employee. I’m going to look into that! Who in God’s name is paying techs $10/hour?//I was in your shoes about two years ago! I’ve been in practice for 20 years, own a hospital, and finally have enough staff to consider what I actually want. I looked hard into a non-traditional residency. I wrote letters, actually found mentors, the whole nine yards.

The further I got in the process, the more uncomfortable it felt. The program was going to take 4-5 years; like you, I‘m not near a university, so the entire time away was like 28 non-consecutive weeks. Not terrible, but something to be considered.

i began to wonder if that amount of academia was what I really wanted. I think I finally realized I wanted something more in my life-  but board certification wasn’t it. I actually became a firefighter and EMT-it’s been the most rewarding thing I’ve ever done.   


Maybe a residency at a specialty practice would be far more tolerable to someone who’s been in the real world for a while.   


Yes, it's possible, and I’m sure you can do it. No, it’s not crazy. I think if you can practice for at least ten years a a boarded radiologist, then the time investment pencils. Best of luck to you!Working from home does sound like heaven 🤣I have to respectfully disagree. I’ve mentored a lot of young vets, and never felt the need for a power dynamic. I thinks it’s part of the profession that we mentor new graduates. They need it, and they need someone who’s present In the same facility.&#x200B;

I misspoke by using the word “need,” I agree. But again, I’m not sure why you think a power dynamic is such an inevitable conclusion to a mentorship. For twenty years, my hospital has had interns, new grads, relatively new grads and support staff who all needed mentorship or collaborative advice.I think perhaps we have a different view of mentorship. To me, it’s a vet on site who helps you m make medical and surgical decisions in real time. Mentorship can also help with the pressures and daily ups and downs of the profession. Having a mentor nearby the first time something detrimental happens with a patient is a very, very valuable thing. 

If I had a new grad who had an off site mentor and kept calling them on the phone all day, I would certainly feel like the employee’s attention was divided. It would be an absurd system.   


Most veterinary schools have ample resources for help with contract negotiation. To your other point, an “ethical situation that they’re not ready for their boss to know about:” yikes. When do they discuss it with their boss? After they’ve covered it up? Spoken to resources outside the hospital and broken confidentiality?   


Again, we have quite different ideas about mentorship. I’m curious ; where are you in your career?   


Also, could you expound on the nature of the “power dynamic?”I’m not an attorney, but I suspect the charge isn’t as important as the sentence; if you’re convicted of a felony, it may be difficult to get a DEA, and many employers draw the line at that conviction. A good lawyer will be your best bet here.Yes, and yes, lol. I managed to get bitten in the face by a Cocker Spaniel on my FIRST DAY as an assistant. The bite was minor-the embarrassment major.

You will learn to trust yourself. You will learn to have confidence in yourself the more and more cases you see. At the moment, you don’t have a lot of “data” or previous case experience to help predict outcomes, and your gut goes off of what you learned in school or read in a book, and this leads to comparisons with the “ivory tower” and this fuels imposter syndrome. You are deserving to be where you are, never forget that. 

At the end of the day we are practicing medicine. It never goes perfect. We do our best we can within our means and the clients’ means. We do not have control over everything. It has been cases where you do everything perfect and disaster still happens that made me realize we cannot control everything. You are only the master of what is in your sphere of control - good PE, thorough lab work interpretation, doing your best to interpret images, honest communication with clients, thorough record keeping,etc. if you focus on what you directly have control of, everything else becomes much easier.

Weak-Chicken-353,"Pay for veterinary school without a loan? Yeah you could definitely do that… if you’re extremely wealthy.A fourth year at another school (remaining anonymous because the Vet world is rather small) here. I have had similar experiences for my rotations and have heard stories from other colleagues on their rotations. I can’t tell if dealing with veterinarians/technicians like what you’re describing is just the demeanor of those working in academia/teaching hospitals or if that is literally just how coworkers are going to be everywhere. I think part of it is just the environment of what teaching hospitals are. It’s a lot of egos and brilliant people (both techs and DVMs) who have their opinions of medicine and their peers. I personally am a “head down, don’t participate in the gossip and politics, then you can leave” type of student. But in doing so, I see and hear a lot of what residents, clinicians, and colleagues say about each other. It’s pretty harsh honestly. I hope your experience gets better, as it’s already tough enough, but honestly, it sounds like what you’re experiencing is a common problem.The exam fee is certainly normal (area dependent) in my opinion. Clients often comment on increasing costs in general, but the quality and standards of care have increased as well over the years. Not only that, but drug manufacturers and retailers are increasing their costs as well. If I am not charging according to their increasing costs, I won’t be in business much longer to sell said products. Times are changing, care is changing, and costs are increasing with them. 

As for the cremation process, I don’t have much of an opinion on that. It sounds as if that would be something that the client should take up with the crematorium. 

“Is your vet shitty” is also a bit subjective. Based on the reason you gave in your post, I would hesitate to say that’s the case. But, I have noticed a trend with client perception of care quality and corporate ownership. Some clients are tough to deal with, some veterinarians may not take as much pride in quality care as others, and some circumstances have a lot of moving parts.Not necessarily. I have seen numerous offers that include production without negative accruals. I do agree though. Our goal as practitioners should be to practice sound medicine. I hate the idea of getting paid in a manner that inherently promotes seeing as many patients as possible and selling as many services as possible.","Medical Doctor.

DogDrJones,"I have worked at practices where the doctors were called by their first name (except in front of clients) and where they were called Dr. The important distinction is everyone getting the same treatment. If someone, anyone is withholding calling you Dr but calls every other vet Dr, you have a problem. It needs to be addressed with the person and management. 

I have seen techs haze new vets or give them a tough time. I have rarely seen things work out without the vet leaving (which may be what is in your best interest.) I didn’t have much experience with this personally, but that’s also because any time someone started to give me a hard time, they quickly felt silly. (I was an LVT for years prior to vet school. I can draw blood and place catheters with the best of them.) I can somewhat sympathize with those working in different positions, because over the years, I’ve worked them all. But there’s a difference between being compassionate and respectful and being walked over or continually questioned. If management doesn’t support a certain level of respect for all doctors, I would leave.Pre-covid vet med was different than post-covid vet med. I’m not a big fan. Vet med can be draining and exhausting, especially if you’re an empath. I had a plan to take minimal student loans and pay them off quickly. Then life happened. When my loans are completely paid off, I may switch careers, but I’ll stick it out until then. Let’s say this- I will highly discourage my child from getting into vet med.","Veterinarian.

PurpleOrchid2,"I’m not sure if you’re US based or not, but if you’re in the US you don’t need to be making the decision on vet school quite yet. You’ll still have 4 more years of a bachelor’s degree to expose yourself to more biology, animal science and chemistry courses to determine if vet school is possible. Being good at science is a strong requirement to be able to make it through vet school and it may not be worth pursuing if it truly is a weak subject for you. Also, going through a vet tech program is unnecessary (and maybe a waste of money and time) if you do ultimately want to become a vet. There’s also nothing wrong with going to tech school and becoming a CVT. It might be a route to a career working with animals without needing as high of grades in science as vet school would need. Just be aware that it’s a very different position and does still require science and math abilities. If you don’t have much experience working in a vet clinic, then just gaining experience shadowing or working as an assistant or kennel staff is the best place to start.There are many decisions to make during pregnancy about risk that you can decide on based on your comfort level. I felt comfortable with just stepping out of the room when the patient was being extubated or if we noticed a leak/anyone started smelling iso. At the clinics I’ve worked at it was my techs doing most of the steps that involved more exposure (intubation, masking down if necessary, recovery). It has meant that I told my staff about my pregnancies very early on (sometimes before my close friends knew) just so I would be able to minimize exposure. If you feel more comfortable using a respirator, there’s nothing wrong with that either.I think the short answer is any corporate will be location dependent. I worked for a Vetcor that was the complete opposite of your experience. A new chief of staff (started 3-4 months before I did) who replaced the former chief of staff that had just taken a role as a regional Vetcor medical director (or something similar?). The former chief of staff still worked a day a week at our location and was always meddling in EVERYTHING. She was also just a horrible person, so that didn’t help. But in my experience definitely not hands off from corporate. And we had absolutely no mentorship. Within 6 months of working there basically everyone with experience had left and we had two vets with 2-3 years experience and then hired 2 new grads that following spring. Hopefully most Vetcor clinics are better experiencesThe starting salaries for new grads has increased significantly in just the past couple of years. Hopefully the pay increases continue, but there is the chance that if things cool off the high starting salaries may not last. I started as a small animal GP vet in a high cost of living area just 7 years ago and I was only making $73k my first year out. There also isn’t that much upward movement possible in vet med for either salary or title once you have a couple years of experience, so salaries may start out somewhat high but plateau really quickly. My husband in software engineering already makes significantly more than I ever could have as a vet and has steady raises + bonus increases every year even though he’s been in the field for a decade now.I’m a bit further out (7 years out, 2016 grad) but I’m pretty sure I’m leaving the profession. I’m expecting my 3rd kid in a couple of months and have been working the occasional relief shift over the past year. I don’t plan to renew my licensing for this upcoming year and then I guess I’ll reevaluate how I feel in 2025. But I’d rather find a new career that I have a chance of loving (or at least not dreading) sooner than later. There’s a chance I may decide to do something that’s a pivot within vet med still, but nothing that I’ve brainstormed so far sounds appealing.Thanks for the advice. I have come across that too. I’ve looked into the specifics for my state and there isn’t much extra needed especially if I decide to renew in the next 3 years (I just need to pay the dues then and have kept up with CE the whole time). Unfortunately since we’re down to 1 salary now, raising 3 kids and needing to pay out of pocket for licensing and CE, the $1k+ a year it would likely cost to maintain doesn’t seem worth it when I’m likely to not come back.Please don’t go into vet med if what you’re looking for is a high paid job above everything else. And please don’t pick a speciality based on which is highest paid. Regardless of what you pick, it’s 4-8+ years of hard work (if you already have the prerequisites met and have finished undergrad) and going into significant debt ($200k+) to get there. There is much more money to be made in human medicine or many other unrelated fields.I’ve seen maybe 2 or 3 non-boarded vets who only did surgeries. I think the ones I know tried to go through a surgery residency and didn’t pass the boards, so slightly different scenario than a standard GP vet straight out of school. They mostly stick to more complex surgeries (lateral tie, gastropexy, pyometras, complex mass removals, etc). They are also mostly an older generation, but I’m not sure if that has anything to do with it. I would guess that with today’s climate, there is probably a place for a GP vet who only wants to do spays, mass removals, dentistries since more and more GP vets aren’t interested in doing those.I'm happy to share my experience although obviously everyone's circumstances and decisions are different, and my experience might not be that encouraging. I'm 33F, live in northeast US. I'm currently pregnant with my third kid and had my first at 28. I was working as a small animal GP up until recently (full time before kids and after my first, then dropped to part time after maternity leave for my second, and then left that job and have worked just occasional relief shifts during this pregnancy). I wasn't the type to always know I wanted kids, but since having them I have definitely chosen to lean into parenting as my main gig. I found that working full time with my first kid in daycare was fine when he was still very little. It was hard to not spend more time with him but I got some weekdays home with him and he didn't really know any differently at that point. Once I had my second and my oldest was about 2 yrs, it started feeling worse and worse to miss out on the time with them. I hoped that dropping to part time would give me sufficient time with my kids to balance a career and parenting, but it just never felt like I actually had time to enjoy spending with them. I do wonder how much was that the clinic was extremely busy with COVID era at that time so every day I was bringing home piles of records to write from home the next day. But overall, I felt very unsupported by my bosses through those first 2 pregnancies and maternity leaves (even though both were mothers to middle school + high school aged kids at the time). I didn't feel like I could take off any time before giving birth and only took 8 and 12 weeks respectively for maternity leave. They didn't bother to give me an adequate place for my pump breaks (or even block off enough time to feel like I could pump without also needing that to be my lunch or call back time). I'm at a point now where I finally feel like I can spend adequate time with my kids since I'm only working a couple shifts a month. I don't think I'm likely to come back to vet med after this baby is born although I don't know what I'll be doing next. I figure I'll take a few years to be a stay-at-home parent while my kids are preschool aged and then once they're in school maybe I'll know what my next career plans look like. I'm happy to answer any questions that may help you in your decision. Overall, becoming a parent is the most rewarding thing I've done in my life.Thanks for your reply! I read both your reply to me and to OP. I can’t imagine how challenging 5 kids in 5.5 years must be! I will have had 3 in 5 years and it already feels like a lot, haha. Definitely a fair point that if I end up taking an extended time off the transition back would likely be challenging. At this point I’m so disenchanted with the veterinary field (how I’ve been treated during my 7 years as a vet, how corporate take overs will continue to occur, how little respect there is for vets both by clients and bosses, etc) that I don’t plan to come back to vet med unless things change dramatically for the better within the profession. I wouldn’t mind keeping up with a relief shift a month, but the out of pocket costs to keep up with licensing, CE expenses, liability insurance, etc doesn’t make sense for so few hours worked. I think I may have been leaving the field at this point even if it weren’t for my current pregnancy and maternity leave plans, but I do want to keep some space for the chance I could come back in the right scenario.I don’t see it being a feasible career path if you don’t like medicine or biology and you don’t think you have good memorization skills. You could always improve your memorization, but if you dislike the central topics you’re going to not be having fun for the next 4-6+ years.",Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment was written by a veterinarian.

ARatNamedClydeBarrow,"As a VA, this makes me so sad for you. Yeah it takes you guys some time to hit your stride, but that’s the same for *everyone*. I would never dream of speaking to a DVM that way. Voicing concerns in a respectful manner and having a discussion is one thing, but to talk to you with such derision is absolutely not okay. It’s far past time for a chat with their supervisor / head doc / PM.

I love my new grad doctors so much! They always like to talk things out with me (I love hearing the trains of thought) and even sometimes ask my opinion if it’s not something they’re super familiar with, but is something I’ve seen before. They love to teach us things they learned in school, it helps solidify concepts for them *and* we probably get to learn something new. I’m losing one of my new grads and I’m super broken up about it, I switched my dog to her when she started and now he doesn’t have a vet.

Some advice for emergencies: even if you’re not comfortable taking the lead, if you’re not occupied doing other things then try to get involved and make yourself useful - for CPR scenarios offer to count or breathe, if you’re comfortable with it restraint for IVC placement, getting hot or cold packs as needed, grabbing supplies for a u cath, pulling out emergency drugs, etc. This way you can observe what the more experienced DVM on the case is doing without hovering too much or getting in the way - biggest thing here though is to know when to ask questions, and when to shut up (don’t go into a full differential while the main doc is trying to interpret rads, for example… you most likely will get yelled at lol). My newest new grad likes to be a “fetus tech” (his words) and help out for little things if he has the time, and tries to be helpful during emergencies if he’s available because he feels it makes him a better doctor.I learned this extremely quickly when I started working ER. I now carry this phrase like a shield and I have to frequently remind my poor new grad DVMs in GP to remember this because I see how much it hurts them when the clients don’t want to listen.","Veterinarian.

InitiativeOdd3719,"I have techs getting paid about 10K less than what your base is. Midwest suburbs. ER clinic but still. No DVM should be paid less than six figures.You deserve betterI suppose it does depend on your student loan debt and cost of living. But debt to income ratios in this field are horrendous and almost unlivable for some people. If you don’t have loans, have a good work life balance and not overworking yourself I suppose then it’s acceptable. It’s crazy to me to think a DVM isn’t getting paid at least six figures in my area.Absolutely! Happy to hear you found an amazing place to focus on what is important to you. ❤️I would love if the federal government would consider more loan forgiveness for in need professions like the veterinary and agricultural fields. Or better yet more academic scholarships for advanced degrees. 

You can get loan forgiveness by working in rural areas, or with large animal. But small animal vets come out of college with so much debt it’s crippling and they have to repay them somehow, thus working their asses off the first few years out of school and burning out before they practice for five years. 

I’m not sure where your pessimism is coming from but it sounds like you might either not be in the field at all or you are experiencing some serious burnout. I hope you take care of yourself and I wish you nothing but light and love.

Edit to add - if I graduate with six figures of debt, you can bet your ass I’m asking for a six figure salary minimum.","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it discusses issues related to veterinary education, student",Veterinarian

Emilyredwine,"I’ve been out 14 years and I do think that your time off should be yours. 

However, I knew nothing when I graduated from vet school and I wasn’t even aware of how little I knew, but I did do an internship and residency and spent four extra years giving up my time off to learn. 

I still stay up night desperately researching cases, but much more of my time off is protected now.

I think you have to find a balance. It isn’t wrong to set boundaries, but especially as a new grad you have to recognize that your growth will be hampered by you not taking the extra time to learn. You will eventually get where you want to be, but more slowly. And you may make mistakes along the way.

I think you should have a frank discussion with your boss about how to achieve your goal of improving and also protecting your time off as much as possible. If they aren’t willing to work with you, there are lots of practices who will.

Right now is a good time to be a veterinarian. There are jobs everywhere.Aseptic is good, it means that the procedure was done cleanly.

You should wear gloves when placing an iv catheter. Also I usually ask my techs to place a gauze square distal to where they are placing it so the catheter isn’t dragged over the hair as it is pushed in.Come work at vmcli on Long Island.

whospiink,"use your sheet! i am 4 years out and i carry a notebook every time with little comments of stuff to remind myself. also, i would actually perform your physical exam BEFORE you get history. i used to do physicals after history, and i noticed i was getting very influenced on what the client was saying. for example if they say “my dog has GI issues that’s why he’s breathing hard” and i would focus on GI issues. but when i did my physical before my history, it would let me use only thoughts and skills and not let anything the client says influence me. hopefully that makes sensegood for you for reporting it, they’re probably firing you to protect their asses-Undergraduate 4 years with fulfilling pre vet prerequisites 
-Veterinary school for 4 years 
-Internship/publications (can take 1yr or more) 
-Residency 3-4 years 

It may take longer depending on if you get into vet school, internship or residency on the first try. You also need a lot of experience and publications to make yourself a good candidate.I am a small animal emergency vet in California, my hospital is incredibly busy with at least 20 patients seen per shift, unlimited PTO and CE, base salary $140k with 22% production grossing about $400k per year. 3 years out of school, femalemy hospital is really good about letting us take PTO, also we are a well DVM-staffed hospital so it is easy to get your shifts covered. we can only take 10 days at a time and i do PTO every 3 months for my mental healthi only work 3-13hr shifts per week at night, im not boarded, no on-calls, i do cut

edit: i guess technically i am on call because i am the vet who mentors new grads/relief vets that dont cut and if they ever need me to come in i always do especially for sx. i dont take their production at all though. we dont get new grads or non-cutting relief vets often thoughin my experience if you dont want to cut i would apply to specialty hospitals/hospitals with boarded surgeons; their ER vets rarely cutyes youre absolutely correct. we had to sign that by having unlimited PTO we wouldnt get it paid out if we left. but i personally dont mind because i for sure take advantage of that PTO and even if they dont have coverage for my shifts they dont ever force me to still come in. i guess its a sacrifice for my mental well being and not getting burnt outthis is exactly how i practice. i was always taught there’s something you can always do. for example, if i get a hemoabdomen from rat bait tox and the owner have no money, then i would just give plasma recheck coags send them with no major hospitalization.this is a completely normal feeling! i have never met anyone who felt confident that they passed that test once the left the exam room. you should relax and let go because there is nothing you can do to change the outcome this point :( and my NAVLE score was pretty on par with the ICVA scores.it should be fine; if they are to get a stump

HumanProject7893,"Hey! I did a graduate programme with V4P and I have to say the training is very good, definitely worth it. However, the downside of this programme (and most of new grad programmes I know from corporates) is that the actual CPDs/training are quite scarce in the sense that you'll do one every couple of months (roughly). The training has a good quality but they give it to you in small sporadic doses so that you have to stick with them during those 2 years, not that it takes 2 years to do that training at all lol. You'd be able to do it in 1-2 months if anything.

So it was overall a good quality programme and a nice extra if you're just planning to do GP for a while with no rush, but if you were thinking of maybe doing a certificate or an internship (these programmes are NOT an internship) etc I'd tell you to do the certificate at the same time with the new grad programme (totally doable time-wise) or do an internship directly.

Most problematic patient names (I saw too many “Blackies” owned by non-Black owners in a predominantly white area)Just because something in some niche field of people is common doesn’t mean it isn’t problematic. You’re showing your racist side once again and stop stalking my posts.I did undergrad at Ohio state and loved it there! Columbus is a great city, plenty to do, great food and festivals. If it wasn’t in Ohio, I’d consider moving back there to work and raise my family. I only explored part of their vet schools but what I saw was pretty nice. The buildings look relatively updated, nice study spaces, separate from main campus but within walking distance so you don’t have to deal with a lot of undergrads if you don’t want to. Teaching hospital is nice from what I saw but I only ever was in the SA ICU. Overall ranked #4 top vet school. 

Started my vet journey at Ross and 2/10 don’t really recommend for many reasons. 

Now at KSU and loving it! Supportive faculty, administration, staff, classmates. Great DEI program that is ever expanding. We have a clinical skills lab every week for the first two years in which you learn anything from animal and surgery skills to business and financial and communication skills. Many clubs who have cool wet labs and lectures. A city zoo ten minutes away and an exotics ward in the hospital. Coursework isn’t any worse than Ross at least and grades tend to be better here. NAVLE passing rates continue to be way above national average. Don’t know too much about clinical year and house officers but it doesn’t seem like they’re overworked on most rotations. Clinicians that I know have all been respectful and supportive. My only grievance is that Manhattan is much smaller than I was used to in undergrad so I miss being in a big city. There isn’t too much to do here and you have to drive 1-2 hours to get to larger cities (which still aren’t very large IMO). Not like you’ll have much free time at any vet school anyway.Second this!^ Or if you’d like a hard copy book, get Dr. Thrall’s “Veterinary Hematology, Clinical Chemistry, and Cytology” textbook. The third edition is the newest. You can also find a pdf of it for free at vet-ebooks.comHi! No kids or live-in partner here, however I echo what everyone else here is saying: complete your degree. It unfortunately sounds like your husband needs to step up with helping out around the home. Also, if he has a good-paying job, would it be possible to get a nanny to help him out some nights/weekends and send them to a daycare if they aren’t in school yet? If you figure out how to have more time free for studying, you can stay at the library/school more to really focus on it. It sounds sucky but it’s only for nine more months and the outcome would be for the best: you get your degree and your mental health would hopefully be a bit better. If your kids even remember the brief moment in life where their mom was away a bit more, they’ll understand that you did it for their futures to be brighter. 

Look into counseling services at your school. Many schools have them nowadays for free. I was at Ross so I know how hard it was booking an in-person appointment with them and how they usually only offered one hour appointments every other week since so many students needed them. However, at my current school, we have two licensed therapists and they tend to be free enough to even do walk in appointments. I believe they also don’t have a stipulation on how many appointments you can have per month, as long as they don’t get super busy (which they aren’t).Ross has between 3-5, most semesters have 4. Plus lab exams for a few semesters the week before. 

KSU has 4 in 4 days for first years. 5 in 5 days for second years, not including any elective class finals bc some have them.","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it discusses various aspects of veterinary education and practice,",Veterinarian

IndigoCatwoman,"I’m turning 30 in the spring and will graduate my DVM in May so sort of where you’ll be when you finish! The biggest thing to remember is that there’s no race in life and everyone is on their own timeline. Just because someone has a house, kids, etc doesn’t mean they’re further along in life - they’re just on a different path and that’s okay!

Relationship-wise - many of my classmates found relationships, some came in with relationships and are now engaged, some came in with a partner and split up (this is where I fall lol), many just didn’t date at all. I can’t tell you where to find a person that fits into your life - I haven’t yet - but I know they’re out there! 30 is still young, don’t put too much pressure on yourself to have all that stuff figured out when you graduate. (As an aside, I just want to say that it’s also okay to not get married and have kids if you prefer to focus on you!! Lots more people are choosing to be childless and it isn’t selfish to focus on what you want whatsoever!)

I’m not sure what your debt load or economy will be like where you’re living so can’t really speak to that. I personally have six figure debt but am still intending to buy a house when I graduate, you don’t necessarily need to have all your debt paid off to do that but it does depend on a lot of external factors that I can’t really comment on. Many many people have debt throughout their life and are still able to have kids etc - you just may have to live frugally or take a bit longer to pay your debt off (ie have a lower monthly payment). Again a lot of this could be different where you live, but these are things I’m looking into myself. 

In the end, if this is what you really want to do, do it and enjoy it! I’m not sure if anything I said will really help that much, but I really just wanted to let you know there’s other people on a very similar path to you so just know you’re not alone!! :)","Other.

zebra_chaser,"First, from the information you provided, it sounds like you made the right decision for your pup. 

Second, I agree with everything else said here. At some point you get very used to death - not sure if that’s good or bad, but not every death hits the same way it did before going to vet school. I’ve learned from every death though, and never made those mistakes again. 

I probably accidentally killed one of my favorite patients. I don’t think I’ve ever sobbed so hard. I found comfort in saying a prayer for him, even though I’m an atheist. Having a ritual helped comfort me and honor him. 

Then there are the ones you save, and man does that feel good. Keeping those front of mind really helps. And you’ll save more than you lose. 

No one is perfect. We are only human.You can work in Australia and New Zealand (source: I am currently doing that), and I believe in Canada and the UK as well. They all are part of a consortium. Probably a good chunk of Europe will accept US schools as well but I don’t know for sure. You can always look up the licensing requirements for countries you’re interested inIt’s the “just enough knowledge to be dangerous” phenomenon

That being said, really awesome nurse and MD clients can be great, because they get the physiology and are compliant. The ones who aren’t great though, are extra not-greatI love your idea for a mobile low-cost clinic. I find low-cost care is some of the most rewarding parts of veterinary medicine. It’s a really narrow field and in desperate need of expansion. 

Everyone in this thread is bringing up great points and I totally agree with them. 

You will experience heartbreak and will need to make tough decisions. There will still be care that animals need that you won’t be able to provide on a shoe-string budget. Let’s say you have a dog with parvo. It’s treatable, but this dog is sick enough that it will require a central venous catheter, aggressive fluids, many injectable medications, and round-the-clock care. All of which is expensive. The dog may live very well live given all of that, but your client or the rescue won’t be able to afford it. Will you be comfortable euthanizing this patient? Or you have a dog with pneumonia. It’s treatable with antibiotics but his breathing is just compromised enough that he needs oxygen, which will require 24 hour hospitalization. Your low-cost client can only afford the antibiotics. Do you take the gamble that the pneumonia will clear up faster than the dog decompensates? Is it fair to the dog to allow it to go home on an antibiotic trial where it will struggle to breathe? Or do you recommend euthanasia? What if the client declines euthanasia?

I’m not saying this to discourage you. Cases like that will make it all the more rewarding when you can vaccinate pups against parvo and know that you’re preventing this fate. Do you want to have the responsibility to make those sorts of choices?Sounds like you’re pretty clear-eyed about the realities of shelter med. I think you can totally consider vet med as one of the ways to achieve your goal. Which is super admirable and important!!! Check out this organization to see if you can get additional contacts in the vet world: https://www.hsvma.org

They also have an “affiliate” membership option, it looks like, for non-vet med professionals, I don’t know much about it but you can check it outVet here. I think you’ll probably have a similar experience working as reception at a human med clinic and a vet med clinic. However, people are very emotional about their animals and not always understanding. My very first vet med job was as a receptionist, and on my very first day, a client accused me of killing their dog because I couldn’t fit them in for an appointment. 

Things you should ask:
- do you have a training protocol for triaging patients (i.e., knowing what might be an emergency and what might not be?). It’s not exactly the same as human medicine
- what’s the flow of your day? The flow of an appointment?
- how do you manage really abusive clients?
- why did the last receptionist leave? How long have the other receptionists been there?

Things I want out of a receptionist as a vet:
- comfortable with emotions - from clients and from themselves. People may be scared or frustrated by their pet’s health and the cost. A friendly kind face does a lot to help with the initial impression of the clinic
- not afraid to ask questions when unsure
- know who to ask for questions - the vet may not know how to collect payment for stuff, and the vet assistants aren’t the ones to ask for medical advice. And knows when to ask questions - can this wait til the afternoon or do you need an answer right now?
- never ever ever gives out medical advice without speaking to a vet first
- able to withstand mildly difficult clients (your average run-of-the-mill ones, not the egregious abusive ones) 
- communicate, communicate, communicate!

You probably already have a lot of these skills. Good luck, I hope you find a good clinic! It can be a lot of fun, interesting, and really rewardingAlways a good sign if there’s good staff retention!Have you taken the NAVLE? Otherwise you’ll have to do an equivalency exam for Australia, and that can require a lot of preparation. You could work as a vet nurse while you’re studying for it.

I did not choose this profession to become a millionaire, I chose it because of my interest in medical science and love for animals.

It is simply a fact that some countries are a better place to live in than others. 

When I said ""better country"" I was simply pointing out that greener pastures exist for veterinarians outside of India(I once again stress that this statement is not intended to belittle india or insult indians.) 

It is an undeniable fact that most developed countries have better labour rights and provide a better work-life balance.No I'm not saying India is bad .

Thing A being better than thing B does not mean thing B is bad .

It is just a fact that many countries provide a better quality of life than India .It takes that long ! I thought the temporary licence would be easy to obtain after passing the NAVLE .Yes , as far as I know, Govt veterinarians are well compensated . 
But I believe new government employees Don't receive a pension and have to invest in the stock market thorugh the NPS scheme(this scheme is also open to the indian public , I believe the US equivalent is called a 401k).

Since the Fall '23 session closed on Dec. 16, I'm hoping the results come out today (obviously they weren't released this morning, but fingers crossed they're released this afternoon), or it may be tomorrow if they're ""behind"" on processing because of the MLK Jr. Day holiday.

dongbait,"As the rDVM, I feel like this goes both ways. Our local ER wants us to call prior to sending any patients their way - which means waiting on hold to talk to the doctor, go over the case, get the estimate, go over the estimate with the client, then type everything up and make sure it all gets to the ER. Fine, whatever. But then the local ER will just send randoms in for surgeries or procedures that the owner can't afford to do with them without extending the same courtesy. So we get a blocked cat whose owner was only told we could unblock for cheaper than the ER, but not that it still costs $2k with my clinic and then the owner is mad at me. Or we get something sent over for surgery without a heads up and have to work it into an already slammed schedule. And when we call for records, sometimes they aren't typed up yet because the ER is too busy.I mean, the whole reason I won't do declaws on cats is because it changes the way they are able to stand and leads to pain/arthritis. In this case, the cat isn't bearing weight on the dewclaws. I would have absolutely no issue removing the extra digits in this case.Personally, 20 minute appointments straight out of school is probably setting you up for failure. When I was newly minted, I was given 30 minute wellness appointments and 1 hour for anything ""sick"" or complicated. There are also little tricks for getting things done in a faster way. For me, it was sending bloodwork out to the lab rather than running it in house. That gave me a time buffer to look up whatever I needed to before going over it with the client and got me out of the room faster - after all, I can't spend tons of time discussing a disease when we don't know for sure what we are dealing with until the results come in. If you have an appointment with a laundry list of concerns (scheduled for ears, but also he's been vomiting for the past week and there's this new lump on his back and the other day he was limping, etc), it's not wrong to focus on which is the most pressing concern today and schedule a follow-up visit for the others. For example, ""Mrs. Smith, it looks like Fluffy's ears are driving him crazy right now, so let's get that under control first. While we have him in the back to get ear swabs, I can get some blood and FNA the lump and send that out to the lab. I should have those results back next week, so let's set up a follow-up exam to go over the results, recheck the ears, and take some rads of that leg if it's still causing him problems.""[https://www.wiley.com/en-us/100+Top+Consultations+in+Small+Animal+General+Practice-p-9781405169493](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/100+Top+Consultations+in+Small+Animal+General+Practice-p-9781405169493)

Plus, unless you live out the middle of nowhere, any noncompete for greater than a few miles is unreasonable.","Veterinarian.

Yay_Rabies,"I’m a CvT in internal medicine.  Our exams run longer than typical GP appointments but here’s what we do.  

-Get and review all info from the RDVM 

-I grab a laptop for the day.  Using a template my boss made I start the appointment.  What you are here for, what signs, when did signs start, C/S/V/D nasal discharge.  What diagnostics.  What meds.  Diet, baseline appetite and current appetite.  House mates, travel history and any prior major medical issues.  

-If the animal isn’t totally freaked out I do a TPR and a weight if the front desk doesn’t get it.  

-I relay this info to my vet and give her a heads up if the animal is scared.  

-She talks to them and goes over the plan.  We examine the animal in the room or in treatment area.  So my notes are already and in front of her.  She also uses a transcription service later for her PE.  

There’s only a few extra things I ask and it usually stuff like for a hard to control diabetic I will review insulin use.  Co-signed by a vet tech who had to leave her rural hometown to find a better start and has now lived outside of a major US city for years.  ","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

moo_moo_motherfuckR,"Day = madeIn my experience--and I'm generalizing, here, so take it with a grain of salt--I've found that human nurses tend to be some of the the most disrespectful clients in vet med.

Once, my supervisor took a phone call with a client who was requesting to be prescribed (prescription-only) flea meds for her dog. My supervisor explained that we need to have seen her dog in the last year for an exam before we can get those scripted out, and she was overdue for one. The lady protests, and my supervisor explains that it's literally the law. We HAVE to see the pet. Client goes: ""Look, I'm a nurse. I understand that's the law. But trust me, my dog is healthy. Just prescribe the meds.""

My supervisor says no.

Client demands to speak to a doctor, like a doctor is going to tell her any different.

My supervisor hangs up. It was quite literally the only time I've ever seen her do that.

Nurses are superheroes. But human nursing knowledge does not transfer to vet med. Let's all just respect each other, right medical professionals??This!!I agree 100%","Medical Doctor.

Order_Rodentia,"No, it’s not that bad. There are some issues present in the field, but for the most part the people that are happy are out being happy and not posting about it on Reddit. Your first year out you don’t have a lot of confidence/experience yet and the job can be scary and overwhelming, especially if you don’t have good mentorship. If you go into a whole lot of debt going to vet school, you may have regrets after graduating when a significant chunk of your income goes to student loan repayment, so you want to keep costs down there if you can. Honestly, ask the people at your clinic what they think since they seem happy!We were incredibly slow in November and December, picked up a tiny bit in Jan and Feb, and it's picked up some more now. I'm not as busy as I want to be still, but at least I don't have hours of downtime per day right now.No, as I said in my other comment to you, there is a difference between the state board exams and the national board. The NAVLE is the national board exam and it's going to be consistent across all states. You have to study for that one, there's no getting around it. After you pass the NAVLE then you can take the state exam for whatever state you'll be practicing in.Corporations have made it so private practices have a hard time competing against them. Pharmaceutical companies have special discounts for their corporate partners (was talking to my Zoetis rep about this the other day) and corporates have it easier/less expensive when it comes to giving good health insurance and other benefits. I think you can still find good private practices out there that offer excellent benefits, it just may take some looking. I’ve worked in corporate practices since I’ve graduated for various reasons, but I don’t think they should ALL be corporate and I wish the playing field was more level.I attempted to go into residency, wanted to help my school start up a new residency program (not going to say the specialty for anonymity) and the interest was there, and things were in the works, only for them to later tell me there was no funding for it. Found out a couple of months after that, it was given to another student because the surgeon she was dating provided the funding for her.Honestly it all worked out for the best for me. They were barely able to get her graduated and the program crumbled under mismanagement from the head of the department (the one that lied to be about funding). I’m out in GP, and although it wasn’t what I set out to do, I’m thriving.I usually just put Dr. Name on mine and leave off the DVM but I've seen it all three ways. I've never worked for a place where it mattered but YMMV.Only a mask for a OHE?! Yeah, they’re wanting you to practice garbage medicine. Find a better clinic where you can get some mentorship and you’ll thrive.I’m also a double-ligater and I learned I was tying the knots too close to the clamp the hard way. Nothing like seeing a pedicle snap back into the abdomen and leaving your ligature floating in a rapidly growing pool of blood.Depends on if you’re going for CE, and how much CE you need. I usually attend lectures in the mornings/early afternoons and then have my late afternoons/evenings free to do whatever. If I want to do something that will take up an entire day (like Disney) then I make sure I’m getting my CE hours in another day. Take a look at the lecture schedule, see what interests you, and go from there.I’ve always done euthanasia payment upfront but it’s so the client doesn’t have to do it afterwards when they’re crying and upset and sad. We have the tech talk options with them and once they decide what they want we check them out and get it squared away so they don’t have to worry about it after the procedure.

The call outs are an issue. Once that becomes a culture it’s hard to get it to stop.I have a sleeve and a half and I have no issue with practicing in the Atlanta area. You’ll probably end up with them covered naturally, as I wear a thin underscrub daily to help protect my arms and a lab coat, but other practicing vets in the area let theirs show and it’s no issue, as long as they’re not obscene or offensive.Love of biology, medicine, and zoonotic infectious diseases.I did a MS before vet school and my application highlighted my research experience and expressed interest in the zoonotic research that the vet school was doing. I applied to my in-state school and got in, but granted this was 8 years ago. If I would have applied to some of those schools you listed I doubt I would have been considered. You might have to broaden your net some. There are also some newer schools that have opened up/are opening up in the US that might be easier to get into as well.

Somethingto_Chewon,"If you were in Ga I would have thought you were at a particular hospital. Def hire a lawyer asapYou'll survive with these three people: a good tech, a good practice manager and a good receptionist. Each of them make your job worlds easier.One thing I always told my newer vet receptionists: it's ok to not know everything or have an answer for everything. It's ok to argue with the Dr on what is put on the schedule. It's ok to say no if what they are asking is not something your clinic does or is able to do.

As the first and last person everyone sees and speaks to at the hospital, they'll trust you with A LOT of info, a lot of it you really don't need to know. You're essentially the face and the person that will automatically lull the client into feeling either safe or unsafe at your clinic. Having a balanced persona or attitude is key to a successful business. 

I would expect to be asked questions about how strong is your stomach and heart for intense situations? Are you calm on the phone when someone isn't? Can you be silent with a client who is clearly distraught is coming at you full emotional force telling you YOU are responsible for their pets demise (even though you're just the front desk)? Being a vet receptionist takes a lot of patience, a lot of active listening and sometimes a strong stomach for what you perceive as abuse. 

Another thing to consider: I worked for Banfield as a CSC or front desk. I was alone for maybe all of my 7-7 shift and sometimes the nurses and Drs would step out and I'd be left having to answer some shitty questions like, ""my dog is coughing up blood! Do I come to you or go to er?"" Because yes you def want to see them (pet numbers) but you're unsure if the nurses or Dr will be back by the time this person arrives. Banfield required me to make call lists and call people 2-3X a week to have them bring their pet in for comps or dentals, even if the pet had a 4/6 murmur and was super not ok to go under anesthesia (pet numbers). My old clinic had a clique issue: me VS the nurses for some reason. That's not good.

I would ask how the atmosphere of the workplace is during the work week. Ask about what all you would be doing during your shifts, what EXACTLY is expected of you. At my current job, they laid those out to me very clearly and it was very easy to jump into the flow of things. Some clinics are harder to jump into.

This was kind of rambly, sorry.Yes! Absolutely! At Banfield, I was literally sometimes the VA with asking the questions my actual VA never bothered to ask the client because I actually KNEW the client because I spoke with them on the phone a LOT. I knew their financial issues, emotional issues, sometimes I knew about their messy af divorces; we're everywhere! One client came out to me on the phone after yelling at me that I insinuated he was gay because he got a French bulldog. (What I actually said was ""oooh girl a Frenchie??"" 🤷‍♀️ It was a weird day. I love my job and all the human interaction but maaaaannmn this job feels harder than my old Starbucks job some days.Absolutely not all clinics are like this. I worked for a Banfield clinic that was considered the run off clinic (smashed between two-four busier clinics and whatever they couldn't see we would) so we were ALWAYS stacked. Doctors stressed, I'm alone at front desk for 11 hours and stressed, VAs really stressed.

Then I quit and moved hospitals outside Banfield that makes MUCH more money but it doesn't feel like it. The back supports itself and the doctors and I have another person up front all the time. There are many better options. Don't let yourself get eaten up by the negatives, find somewhere that will value you.And that job is SUPER physical too","Veterinarian.

Such a shortage your average radiology candidate has to complete two speciality internships after rotating just to match for residencyYou do realize that radiology speciality internship was not a thing five years ago right? That became a thing for the same reason it did in surgery, too many people applying to residency than spots available. Radiologist salaries have not drastically increased to justify a “shortage”. If anything they have stagnated to decreased since there is such an influx (same thing with all vet med)Here’s the truth that I know bothers some people. It’s not about natural intelligence, it’s about putting in the hours. Most of medicine in the beginning is straight memorizing. There’s just a shit ton of info that you have to program in before you can start putting the mechanisms together. Just put in the time. Learn to be disciplined about it and you’ll be just fineWas the purpose of putting you at that first place because they had the case load for it and the second clinic did not yet? Are they expecting higher volume with the new build?Damn that’s strange. Hopefully it’s just a weird period that passes soon when the big hospital opens. The appeal of a new fancy vet hospital opening up will likely make people choose it first when their 1yo MN Bernese swallows a tennis ball at 2am. 

Since it’s not too far off from opening, I would just wait it out . I mean, all those empty spots on the schedule can be filled with online ultrasound CEVPA sounds like a good way to make educational and credentialing organizations a lot of money but that’s about it.

stockholm__syndrome,"Why am I happy? No debt, I get out on time or early most days, and have good support from staff and colleagues at work. 

The first point is the hardest IMO. Do whatever you can to keep your debt low. Go to the cheapest school (usually your in state), work for scholarships, and live within your means especially while a student. It’s life changing not to have the $100k+ cloud hanging over me like some colleagues have. 

The next two points are all about where you choose to work. Before you take a job, spent time there (ideally several days or weeks) just seeing how it works and how everyone gets along. Find a clinic that appreciates you and understands your mental health and happiness are critical to their production. That means ensuring you aren’t overbooked, you have mentorship, support staff are component and also happy, bad clients get fired, and you’re compensated fairly for your work. No clinic will be perfect, but they should always try to do better. And if you wind up in a clinic that’s not suiting your needs, don’t be afraid to leave for a better opportunity.","Veterinarian.

Puzzleheaded-Fly9461,"UF was just as bad.  I was floored at how unprofessional the “professional school” was.  From sexual comments during surgery to racist observations about clients, and even occasional laying of hands on students, UF was toxic AF.

Add onto that the fact that most faculty don’t know how to use the learning equipment and refuse to learn, it was a terrible experience all around.I remember during a surgery with him and a third year resident where he proudly announced to the entire surgery suite how much better said resident had gotten at “screwing” and then gave us all a hearty guffaw as if he cracked the funniest joke.  We all looked down quietly and all I could think was what is this, middle school??

I also heard the stories about him laying hands on students and was genuinely nervous going into that rotation that he would try that shot on me.  Wouldn’t have ended well.We had a resident in derm ask if a certain client was Mexican because “they always own Breed X” (can’t remember the breed).  They said it in front of a LatinX student and she called her out on it saying how racist it was.

Part 2:

https://youtu.be/xGHY2oOun34?si=j0-hqV1l0-0RFvdcThank you!  You are the first person to not assume I'm a new grad. (I am, though).  However, I'm also interested in practice ownership where I will bring on new grads and also will be receiving my first appraisal soon where I have exceeded my benchmarks.  I put a lot of work into doing well at this job and I know my employer is pleasantly surprised that they didn't take the financial hit that they expected to. I would like to know how much I've saved them by exceeding their expectations so that I can advocate for myself during my appraisal and not rely on my employer to tell me what they think.

Some people may not be a fan of this, but this isn't my first career and I firmly believe that people need to go into appraisals with a firm understanding of the value they bring to their organizations. If my company negotiated a $100k salary expecting to lose $20k my first year and I exceeded $100k, then from my negotiating point, my original salary should have been $120k.  For the entire first year, I took a large hit whenever I took PTO as that is based on my salary and not production while they avoided losing the $20k they expected to on my salary.

(BTW, this is not a critique of my employer as I understand that we both entered negotiations with an element of risk and I wouldn't begrudge them for using the data they have available which influenced their first and subsequent offers. I've also made up numbers for these examples. Ultimately, I was very happy with my negotiated salary, but if I exceeded the expectations, then I want to go into my appraisal knowing that and not rely on them telling me.)It absolutely should be a concern. As a new grad, my employer negotiated a salary based on the assumption that I will not meet production goals my first year.  If I do make or exceed them (as I am now) then I want to know how much of a windfall my employer has made come time to negotiate future salary.

I also disagree with your opinion about pro-salary in your first job.  It may not be for everyone, but it has done well for me.Full time, SA GP no ER/urgent care. I understand there are lots of variables at play, but employers definitely have an idea in mind when they negotiate salary for first year grads.  First year's are limited to the salary information they receive from recent grads and the school/AVMA reports... the employers, especially corporate companies have a lot more data to use when calculating a starting position for salary.  I just want to know what the employer expectation is.  I know they anticipate losing some money on a new grad w/ pro sal and chalk it up as an investment.  I want to know what investment employers are comfortable making.  Do they make a $100k offer expecting the new grad to only make $75-80k?&#x200B;

>new grads have no way to gauge their ability to make money in the clinic, because they don't know the effect of all those variables that are at play.

Exactly! So when I negotiated my salary, I negotiated in the dark with no idea about what my prospective production numbers would be.  However, I'm sure my employer had a pretty good idea about what they expected me to earn since they have access to lots of information about what first year grads make. And that's what I want to know. I'm happy with my salary.  However, as someone who exceeds my benchmarks, I want to know how much more I made the company than they truly expected me to make my first year.  That way, when I get appraised soon, I can advocate for myself.

I'm sorry if you can't comprehend that a person can simultaneously focus on improving at their job while also calculating how much their effort is worth to their employer. I work for a company that makes money off the work my team and I put in.  We deserve to be compensated appropriately and if my salary was originally negotiated lower than what it should be, then I am within my right to fight for a fair salary.Thank you for the answer, but I didn't ask how much I should be bringing in to meet my production benchmark, I'm trying to find out how much employers expect new grads to bring in.  I'm exceeding my benchmarks as is, therefore my employer is not taking the loss on me that they undoubtably expected to when they hired me.  I would like to estimate how much that is so that I can best advocate for myself during my appraisal. 

For example, say most new grads miss their production benchmark by 20%.  Then my company hired me at $100k expecting me to only earn $80k my first year.  The 20k difference would be the ""investment"" they expected to make in me. However, if I work hard enough during my first year to exceed my salary benchmark, then my employer didn't have to take that $20k hit for hiring me as a new grad. It means we negotiated a salary too low to begin with.  I would like to know that with quantifiable information as my hard work has made my company more money then they expected so that I can appropriately advocate for myself during my appraisal.Thank you! I understand your point here, but what I'm looking to calculate from my question is a little different. 

It is well established that employers expect to take a loss on a new grad their first year as most don't meet the production break even point to pay for themselves in the first year.  Employers generally chalk this loss up to the investment cost of a new grads to make them efficient and competent enough to make or exceed the breakeven production goal.

I'm in the position where I am already exceeding production goals, through my own investment in myself outside of work to learn, grow, and develop efficiencies. Therefore I would like to calculate how much I've saved my employer by them not having to take that ""new grad"" hit.  For example, if my salary is $100k + 20% pro sal, then my break even point is $500k.  If my employer only expected me to make 80% of that, then they really expected me to earn $80k of my salary ($400k production).  There would be a $20k hit to them that would be written off as training.  However, if I make or exceed my production, yes I do get my contractual payment, so I don't ""lose"" money, but I also have saved the company from taking that $20k hit they were expecting.  I would like to know what that amount truly is, hence wanting to know how much employers expect of new grads.

As I prepare for an appraisal, it is important to know my worth in a way that allows me to best advocate for myself.  Having my production numbers is one way to do so, however knowing what I have really saved the company through my performance and additional work outside the office allows me to maximize my leverage.I don't doubt your experience, but from everything I've been taught and experienced the last 6 years it seems things may be different now.  Every employer rep (private and corporate) who came to talk to us in school about negotiating salary stressed to us that they don't expect new grads to make production during their first year (which is why they recommended that we always ask for no negative accrual).  Even when I first started with my current employer, they highlighted several times that they didn't expect me to make or exceed my base and once I quickly started to they were genuinely surprised.These are valid points and you are correct that I wouldn't rely on this information as the sole grounds for requesting a salary adjustment.  However, I would argue that there is value in knowing how you performed compared to how you were expected to perform in a quantitative manner.  I'm sure if I underperformed compared to how an employer expected me to perform, they wouldn't hesitate to bring it up to me.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

33554432,"I'm at Penn, I think it's a mixed bag. 

Cons: the curriculum I'm on is being phased out and a new one is coming in, so it's very much in a transitory state. Seems like the new curriculum is good and is getting people more hands on experience? Hands on experience rn is in the cons column for me, it mostly falls on me to pursue opportunities outside of class. Also my big complaint is disorganization and communication. It often feels like no one is ""driving the car"" and there are just too many siloed services that don't talk to each other or to us lol. Also I do not like Philly that much (expensive and I'm not a city guy) and the split campus thing sucks if you're large animal focused (large animal hospital is an hour outside the city). Oh also we lost our exotics service during the pandemic.

Pros: High quality of professors (sometimes a bad thing bc a person teaching you is too educated to see where common blind spots might be), a lot of them are very good at teaching. Good case load for certain things (shelter med and small animal stuff in general, small animal specialty, standardbred race horses, high level show horses, dairy and pork to some extent). Scholarship availability seems to be halfway decent here too, maybe better than at a public institution? Also I think the abuse students receive here is less than at other schools? Idk reading some other threads here I suddenly feel like I have it good, very few people have given me a shitty attitude. And the gossip suggests that the really egregious cases actually get addressed. I also feel like the education has made me super prepared for the NAVLE but I'm also a tryhard who studies too much. 

Idk that I would recommend it (maybe if you really like the city and you're small animal focused with an eye for residency) and if I got a do-over idk that I would go here again for sure (I had a comparable offer elsewhere), but I feel very confident that it could be worse, I don't super hate it here, and I'm getting a pretty solid education at least in the theoretical parts.","Medical Doctor.

kittykalista,"I’m not a veterinary professional, but I’m an aquarium hobbyist with several years of experience. I’ve done a lot of personal research on fish medicine and care, and I like to offer help on a few subreddits to people seeking disease and treatment advice, since aquatic veterinary care isn’t accessible to most fishkeepers. 

I encounter a lot of people who have issues with their aquarium setup, their water, or their basic husbandry that are causing their fish’s symptoms or preventing the fish from recovering, and a disappointing amount absolutely refuse to listen to those recommendations.

They want a medication they can throw in the tank to fix the problem and ignore all the well-meaning people trying to offer helpful advice. I asked my SO, who was a vet tech for four or five years, if that was an issue they had at his clinic, and he said absolutely.

It always perplexed me that people would go to a forum asking for help, then refuse to answer questions or listen to the people who showed up to help you, but why people would go to a verifiable expert, pay for their advice, then completely ignore that advice is beyond me.

jwolf185,"It’s not simple. It’s mostly vets and vet techs who do cleanings. It’s all under anesthesia if you want to do it properly, so you wouldn’t be able to do a mobile unit. Unless you find a practice that is exclusively a dental practice, it would be almost impossible to find one that would hire/train for only cleanings. I’m not sure what a dental exclusive practice would require, mainly of the techs that work in that type of practice are specialized but not all. Laws also vary depending on where you are as to whether you need to be a licensed/tegistered veterinary technician or not. Also, monitoring the anesthesia is often a part of it as well, so that adds a complicating factor.

PeachCoyoTea,"Yes this is very true! I guess the title should have been “To those considering employment offers”… was just speaking from my own level of experience, since my first job out of vet school was with a corporation who (unfortunately) were simply not honest actors.The general idea is to *get all promises written down* so if they fail to deliver you aren’t locked into a bad situation for 1-2 years. Imagine you are promised formal structured mentorship then end up in a situation where they go “welp, the senior person quit and so did all the other doctors, so bummer guess you will just have to teach yourself” (this, sadly, isn’t far from what happened to me)… in those circumstances, having mentorship actually defined in your contract will prove incredibly valuable.

Examples of things to define: Who will be responsible for providing the mentorship? For what length of time can you expect to receive dedicated mentorship (3-6-9-12 months)? What does basic training progression look like (shadowing to extended appointments to normal appointments, or are you on a full schedule from day one)? Will the mentor be onsite initially during surgeries and appointments or only available by phone? What is the earliest you would be expected to work shifts alone in the clinic? Then, of course, what happens if there is no longer someone onsite to mentor you?

Depending on the size of the practice/corporate, their lawyers should be able to help with specific language. Your own contract lawyer could also help with writing it in too…. I know CSU offered contract review, so that may also be a resource depending on your school?It is true you don’t necessarily *need to* explain the why when setting those boundaries… Are they explaining why they won’t negotiate on that point in return? That can give a lot of insight into their expectations and whether they are reasonable for someone at your level.

However, one reason this is not a good idea with new grads is you simply will not be meeting baseline production numbers for anywhere from 3-9+ months (depending on your level of support and personal progression). Focusing on production and speed too early will only encourage you to develop bad habits. Also, honestly it’s not even a good idea for more experienced vets entering into a new practice for their first 6-12 months. It simply takes time to get established somewhere - learning the systems, developing flow with staff, and building your own clientele.It sounds like you are planning to consult a lawyer and that’s a great idea in your position… Tbh I would be skeptical of them trying to “lock you in” before even reaching final year, especially with bonus payouts that far ahead of starting the position.

While that may be true about firing, a lot of things happen in business that can quickly change attitudes around things like that, including sudden changes in management or performance expectations. But, it isn’t just about the threat of firing per se, rather termination of the agreement for *any* reason. For example, what if you do not pass your licensing examination? What if you are kicked by a horse on one of your last clinical rotations and need to delay the start date? What if you have to quit your position for any other number of unforeseeable incidents?

Sadly dishonesty was a little rampant in my situation. From false promises in recruiting to failure to intervene in serious ethical issues in the clinic… Those things are not always foreseeable, but CYA on the front end can definitely help mitigate how seriously they affect you on the back end.Sadly this has been kind of spot-on with somethings I’ve seen and heard…. Hands-off in the autonomy sense is very different than just leaving practices alone to collapse. When they are driving senseless goals but not providing enough resources to actually help practices meet them that creates barriers not freedom.Do you have names of any (west or southwest)? Still feels so hard to identify all the smaller ones out there….That’s cool they include support staff in their incentive programs, I really would love to see more places putting that into motion (we all know a doctors’ “productivity” is incredibly dependent on how supported they are).

Do they have specific programs to help develop new vets? Has your experience been their public advertising actually at least somewhat matches what you’ve seen actually… exists?That’s sad but I guess not surprising to hear considering they are one of the major Mars competitors. Thanks for sharing your experience.I actually hadn’t heard of UVC and looks like they do have hospitals in my area - thanks!I have heard positive things about the training offered to new vets, have you had any exposure to that?Hadn’t heard of some of those companies, Thank you!Thank you for sharing this… does Amerivet  seem like they are building things in a sustainable way (developing well thought out systems, not expanding too rapidly, etc)? 

The majority of the practices around here are corporate-owned. While the market is cooling off it feels better to at least pick which one seems most in line with my needs versus go to an private practice and roll the dice as to who they’ll end up selling the to….That sounds like a lowish offer for even new grads but decent for someone also wanting ownership options… however TN is a hard pass for me and many other vets I know. Avoiding getting toooo into it here, but yeahhhhh… in this now female-dominated industry, states that sentence women to death for unforeseen pregnancy complications is a no-go.

You are not a professor or administrator.  You are ""staff"" like the secretaries,  accountants, janitors,  and marketers.  

When it comes to pay and raises its university wide and that's it.  I worked at a university for a few years as an RVT.  One year there was a pay freeze, the next great year I got an 11 cent raise.  And so forth.  

The pay is really bad but the benefits are better than what you see in corporate or private practice.  I liked my job but they were trying to kill me with understaffing.  It was horrible.  That said as long as you have your license you are hireable.I worked at a university over 10 years ago and I was making $13 by the time I left to do the work of 3 people.  My work load was insane.  I had to be on call once a month for a weekend for no on call pay.  My shift differential and holiday pay was decent though.  My health insurance was the best I've ever had but I'm very healthy especially at that time so I never used it.  Also I had decent sick and vacation but we were so short staffed I could never use it.  My retitled match was very generous compared to what you'd find in private/corporate though.  University is great if you really depend on your health insurance,  or if you plan on being there for a long haul -- the retirement adds up.  

In corporate my 401 K match is less than 1 percent, my health insurance covers nothing until you hit your 2500 deductible (so it's kinda catastrophic only,  if you have nickel and dime stuff through the year like check ups or a UTI or whatever you are stuck paying out of pocket despite paying in every paycheck)  vacation day wise I've been at my clinic for over 4 years and I'm up to accruing 70 hours of vacation time and 40 hours of sick yearly which frankly isn't much in the scheme of things.  

I've been licensed for almost 20 years, I work in specialty, and I've only this year broke making $50 K a year and that is only possible due to overtime,  on call days, and working holidays.  

Fifty K a few years ago was pretty good pay around here but in 2024 its only enough to get by.  Add to I have a license, a degree,  two decades of experience, and I work in a ""specialty"" clinic and pull long hours (typically 11 - 12 hours a day 4 days a week plus on call) and it's not very much at all.

soderstrom_ansa,"I will say i have the same concerns as you, even though I am not in the exact same position. 

I was 21 years old when I entered the vet school. It might not be as bad, but I realized it took us 11 semesters or 5 1/2 years to get the DVM degree  in Indonesia. So I will be at least 26 or 27 when i graduated.

The concerns I had is with how job availability works in Indonesia. This country has a very, very discriminative job requirements regarding the age, and there's no law protecting the citizens from it. Most of the companies here only hire people BELOW 25, while at the same time most of them require the applicants to have an experience in the field at last a year or two. So the anxiety just ramped up when I realized that. I have no experience and I will be older than 25 when I graduate.

But I think being a vet is more than a job, more than an errand to do to get money. I decided to be a vet in a very recent time before I get to the school, yet I already love being a vet student in my 6th semester now. I don't think I wanna be or can be anything other than a vet. If there's no way for me to work in my country, I can just work at another (I guess).

So, I think there's no harm for you to just go and achieve your dream as a vet, especially when age is not a big deal there.

According-Anybody-91,"Short form in case you go for the to tldr below:

1. Avoid corporate if at all possible
2. Consider working as an assistant at a clinic/hospital for experience before making any huge commitment. Get hands on experience, talk with people directly in the field, and maybe see human behaviour at its finest. 
3. Ask newer-grads (less than five years out). I only say this because they will have been there for the hell that was covid and beyond. Sad to say, but some people have changed for the worse since then, and pet-socialization was limited to none, so the patients are uncontrollable. Makes for a fantastic combo. 

That being said...

Speaking from the vet-tech side of things, I will say you're less likely to have regrets going in as a veterinarian then as a vet-tech. Despite the debt ratio, you'll have a stable, liveable income after the first couple of years. 

I've seen both happy-as-clams vets and deep regret vets. The vets with regrets have usually been in the industry for a few years and are burning out in a toxic environment. The best advice I can offer is avoid corporate at all costs. Unless you have been in the industry for a long time and have an established specialty, it's not worth it. The new grads that have left the industry the fastest, that I've known and witnessed, started  in corporate (this was Houston, TX and Halifax, NS, so these were not a localized experiences). 

I recently left vet med after 15 years. Again, there's obviously a huge experience difference between a vet and a vet-tech, but I think it helps to hear from the second line. Someone else mentioned the difference between pre- and post-covid. The demand is higher, more people are leaving the industry because of burnout or lack of growth opportunities, and small practices that are struggling are being snatched up by corporations. My favorite job was purchased by corporate (I wasn't there at the time because I had moved to Canada shortly before), and now all I hear about are all of the changes that are for the worse. One of the vets who works there, who is one of my best friends, was already starting to burn out during covid and was questioning whether she made the right choice. Now that the clinic is corporate, she's regretting everything. She's a very bubbly, energetic extrovert, so hearing that the situation has her this low is really disheartening. She's a feline specialist, so her options are limited because she just bought a house a couple of years ago. Even specialists have their limitations. 

If you find the right place and people, you should be fine. Specialization will get you very far, if you can get through the hell that is internship (if your parents/partner/friends can help with bills etc, do not pass that up. Take whatever help you can get). Avoid corporate. They will tempt you with hire bonuses and employee discounts, but then treat you like number instead of a name. Take breaks (turn off your phone when you're on them). If you're unhappy, leave. You don't owe them anything.

I’m a GP vet but my favorite externship was in exotics.Causes of seizures that lie outside of the brain. They either won’t work or can exacerbate the problem. Phenobarbital is hard on the liver so it’s avoided in hepatic encephalopathy. 

Others require correcting the underlying problem like giving dextrose to a hypoglycemic patient.

_Shwasted_,"SCORES ARE LIVENot a lawyer, nor official legal advice. Data breaches of this type often result in class-action lawsuits. It is worth potentially discussing if you know a lawyer. If this happened with the SAT, MCAT, GRE, or any other standardized test, it would be all over the news.

Additionally, this is a direct breach of FERPA laws, and anyone who was in the November 1st - December 15th testing block should report this to the Department of Education using the ""FERPA Complaint Form"" at the bottom of this page: https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/file-a-complaintThen they'll blame another delay on the influx, scores by 5 PM on the 19th instead lol...It should not have taken 36 hours to fix a ""glitch"". If it was only a glitch with distributing through their ""test vendor"". They should've still had the proper data and been able to send directly to the schools or via email.

This sounds (in my opinion), like a major data mixup in their systems and the extra long timeline to fix it is because they had to recalculate scores and pair them properly with names, test dates, and student IDs all over again.

Source: I work in tech involving database management.I personally saw students posting results with direct scores, not a ""generalized comparison""... How do they explain the giant field on the pdf that said ""SCORE:"" with a specific number? 

And 1.3% of candidates would be 104/8,000, based on just the reddit thread and forums, it seems like that number is higher. 3rd party investigation is absolutely needed to validate these claims. I hope a good lawyer gets involved in this.Check your spam folder, they've ended up there for a lot of people!The fact that this also deals with international student data puts the ICVA at a high risk for legal action. They should not be allowed to sweep this under the rug.Hard to believe a glitch could cause such a huge issue too… databases are generally pretty idiot proof. Dare I say it almost feels intentional. Someone trying to edit their friend’s scores in the system before it went live?Yeah 80% of the data being mixed up but the score (the actual legal requirement for a FERPA violation) somehow NOT being wrong is suspicious at best.I feel for the students who saw a passing score already and may yet find out otherwise due to this issue. Definitely going to be a lot of complaints and requests to re-calculate scores. ICVA owes everyone a lengthy response and explanation of how they confirmed the newly released data will be accurate.

Shockingly bad mishandling of a situation by this organization. I’m not even a vet student, but I just can’t pull myself away from watching this disaster unfold.","Other.

sammclark5452,"I agree with what others are saying! There’s also the AAFP (American association of feline practitioners) for veterinarians as well. I know several people who specialize/practice solely feline medicine :)Hey! I’m not at UC Davis but I’m at LSU in their dual degree program. My PhD is in virology and arboviruses, and I did research in ecology beforehand in undergrad. Many of the dual degree programs also pay full or partial tuition benefits during PhD and vet school, so it’s a great way to broader your career aspects while also getting much of your school paid for. The dual degree is great from what I’ve heard from previously graduated dual degree students and people working in the field and there seems to be a really high satisfaction rate with what the degrees offer you in the future career-wise. 

I would contact NAVS (National association of veterinary scientists) and ask if their UC Davis reps would mind getting in touch with you. It’s an organization that each dual degree AAVMC accredited institution has a rep in.We have professors who are both PhDs only and DVMs only. It’s fairly common. So you can definitely just have one or the other and teach at a veterinary school. But, as someone doing both currently, I do think it’s a unique set of degrees that allows more freedom in career choices as you progress and I haven’t talked to anyone who regrets getting both, especially with many programs offering tuition benefits and other help during both degrees when completed as a set dual degree program. Our anatomy, virology, pharmacology, and immunology professors were all solely PhDs to name a few. That being said, if you want to teach anything clinical related, you’d need to be a DVM not a PhD. But most of our clinical related classes were taught by solely DVM faculty.We had most of our professors at vet school that were solely PhD or solely DVMs. They were usually researchers as well or clinicians in the hospital part time and then teach clinical classes to us.I get recruiters emailing me or sending me messages on LinkedIn constantly, so it wouldn’t surprise me. I haven’t externed or worked at any of the places either. But I haven’t actually expressed interest in them so idk how great the offers are.

Dargon34,"""When you treat technicians as colleagues instead of inferiors, and approach situations with humility, people are more likely to give you the respect you think you are entitled to.""

Very true points, but if a doctor asks to be referred to as ""Dr. So-and-so"", part of that respect being a two way street is that it needs to happen. Not ignored and refused. That's disrespectful, and whether you respect the person or not, all involved should be respecting the title. 

If your personal opinion is different, that's OK! But theirs might be as well in regards to how they are referred to as, and that's to be respected and ok as wellAgree with everything your saying, BUT, if OP asked to be referred to as Doctor, and a tech refuses, that's an issue.How in the hell are you people getting it's disrespectful to be asked to refer to your doctor as doctor?!?!Yeah, whether or not you respect the person, you respect the title. If a Doctor wants to be referred to that way (as long as it doesn't go against the clinic/standard) then that's what you do. It's not up to a tech in how to refer to a doctor. 

And if you techs reading this don't like that?? Damn, keep it to yourself.As a former tech here, get over yourself? 

A doctor has earned the right to be called that if they wish. If they ask, and you refuse, that's you being disrespectful. You respect the title at least, regardless of how you feel about the person. 

It has NOTHING to do with being of equal importance. It has NOTHING to do with being a slap in the face.
It has NOTHING to do with speaking negative volumes.

You're a tech, extremely important and vital, yes. But, they are doctors, and it well within their right to be referred to as such. I've worked with arrogant ones, and with humble ones. They all earned the title, and have the right to be referred to as Doctor. 

If you don't like that, don't work with doctors.The whole fking industry is toxic. Most clinics, most teams...it's a shitshowAge has no merit to this conversation. 

You went to school, YOU got the degree, they adhere to your title if that's what you want. End of story. Any tech that disagrees is a jealous tech and needs to stfu

Edit: I love all the little tech downvotes..keep 'em coming, but call your doctor Doctor if they preferNo, I understand what you're saying, I'm telling you you're wrong. 

You don't get to determine what a doctor gets referred to as, they do. 

The problem is you're expecting them to be ok with your side (as you mention, a title between colleagues) when their side is just as important, yet holds more merit. If you disagree, refer to my previous point of you don't get to determine what they get called. If YOU don't like it, that's a YOU problem, and you need to get over it...or...leaveIt was the single biggest reason why I left, There's no way to afford a family, much less furthering yourself.Don't be insulting. Neither of you know the particular hospital, and of course Banfield has 1200 of them. There are some definitely horrid clinics (Banfield or not) and some genuinely good ones (Banfield and not). Don't blanket all the clinics. Banfield is GOOD in most areas to get some experience. Especially as a VA, before you know if you want to get your certs or not. Not to mention, they pay better than the private clinics depending on location. So yea, they are corporate, you have to sell their WP's, but if you need a decent paycheck for a roll you're interested in, there are much worse choices.

And you don't need the backhanded compliments

Edit:  love people making shit comments then deletingYou have about 17 years? 15 in GP right? 

When you started off stating they are naive and immature, yea, that's insulting. Then saying ""maybe it's where you need to be."" 

Rude. Don't talk to your clients that way, so why talk to a prospective person interested in the field that way?

And yea, I know Banfield too, over many different hospitals in many different states. They aren't all shit. You sound naive and immature

jmedvm,"Agree always had Dr name because many do not know what “DVM” is. Once my checks (yes dating myself when we used to transfer money by writing a paper check 😆) were printed “DUM” after printing them with DVM after my name. 

(In biz and in writing or print I always use DVM so as not to be confused with a physician.) (Though technically with a PhD I could be Dr name DVM Also in professional correspondence or on a biz card or contact info Name, DVM PhD MS is the proper format but I usually just use Name DVM if just vet biz…so with multiple degrees can have options..)

So, true story, I had the checks reprinted. This time instead of Name DUM I received checks that said 
Name DMV !

(Here in the US in Arizona DMV is Department of Motor Vehicles, the entity which issues drivers licenses and car license plates!)

So, believe it or not I just used them and NOT ONCE did anyone comment or ask what it meant!

😝😳I always introduce myself as Dr First Name, Last Name. But here fortunately or unfortunately mostly was referred to by Dr First Name seems to be the practice in a practice.

liase,"Is your in province vet school not an option? My tuition for vet school was like $6k CAD a year once all the OSAP grants were factored in, so very affordable. Granted it is very competitive and this was about a  decade ago..As a Canadian vet, 100% agree. Go in province or don't do it.Honestly, given the costs of going out of country and how much vets make, I would look into trying to become more competitive at your home school. Can you bump up your marks? A master's? More extra curriculars?Impractical in what way?Sure I get that impatience but also, I think you should try to look logically at the situation. 300k+ debt is huge and will take years (decades?) and thousands of interest. I would be trying to give your home school it's best shot - if you think you have any reasonable chance of getting in. 
I know plenty of colleagues who have had good educations out of country and are dealing with the debts in various ways (family primarily but also loans) but boy, that is a lot of loan to tackle right out of schoolI went to OVC and didn't go to Guelph for my undergrad, and neither did a lot of my classmates. I have friends who worked with the admission team, there is no Guelph advantage. That being said, people who want to be vets from a young age tend to choose Guelph for their undergrad so there is a higher percentage from there. 
I agree though, it is very competitive. But not impossible. For a $300k difference though, I would be making getting into an in province school my priorityAs a vet of 9 years, graduating from OVC, I could not echo this more. 
Back before vet school, with some rose coloured glasses on, I might've had that ""whatever it takes""  attitude about becoming a vet. In hindsight, I feel extremely grateful to have gotten into to OVC and would NOT have become a vet if I had to go overseas. $300k debt is insane. Crippling. And on top of that, trying to afford life itself (house prices in Canada are insane). Nope. I love being a vet but it would not be worth it.

i-touched-morrissey,"You might try something else as a career. When you get out into the real world, things might get stressful. My mental health was shit when I was in vet school, only I thought everyone was as stressed out as I was. I didn't get help until my dad committed suicide when I suspected that there was something wrong with me. 

As a practicing vet now, I obsess about what people think, what I said, I worry that if I can't fix something that I suck and no one will want to come see me again. Some days I wish I was a kindergarten teacher, but then I would worry about pissing off someone's parents. I always wanted to be a pathologist, but never made it further than vet school, but it is ideal for an introvert who doesn't feel comfortable speaking to people.I have been in practice for 31 years and there are definitely times when I wish I was something else. Interacting with people is the most difficult part of my job, and a lot of us vets are high-achieving, sensitive people who get down on ourselves when something goes awry. I live in a small town and the gossip and backstabbing on social media can be heartbreaking and depressing. 

As far as being financially stable, it took me about 9 years to pay back my student loans. I worked for a doctor who expected me to drop everything if someone called after hours, was passive-aggressive, and paid on commission, so my first 14 years were difficult. Now that I am a practice owner, things are better but still stressful in different ways. 

I have a nephew who is in college to apply to vet school and he's smart and his family is wealthy, so he won't be burdened with the horrible debt after school. If you are financially endowed, it will make your life better after graduation.I'm a solo doc in rural Kansas and I have been sitting around in the afternoons for the last few days. I will have people from the big city come occasionally because they are booked out for weeks. How that happens I will never know.Way back in 1992-1993 during my senior year, we had bullying senior clinicians. I was pregnant during my large animal rotation and had HORRIBLE headaches and nausea, and one of my clinicians said that I was lazy and spent too much time in the conference room with my head on the table. Most of the other large animal clinicians were very supportive, offered congratulations, were nice people except this guy. We also had a really awful equine surgeon. He embodied the definition of being a total dick. If you were in the ""in"" crowd, he was a blast, but if you were someone like me who hated every second I was in the equine/cattle side of the school, you better watch out. The interns were not much better. The residents were OK, I think they were as stressed as the senior students. We had seniors and interns having affairs, and interns and clinicians having affairs. 
I suppose everywhere in academia it's like this. Don't they make TV dramas about medical students having to deal with asshole doctors in hospital situations?I'm so old I have no idea what a Nerdbook is.Do you have access to Crumbl Cookies?I have 3 kids who are adults. I did surgery, took radiographs, whatever the day called for with no special precautions.I graduated from Kansas State University in 1993 and we had clinicians who buddied around with popular senior students and those of us who were academically outstanding and didn't know about brown nosing fell behind. I was 6th/100 in my class going into my senior year, but since I wasn't one of the ""popular"" kids and didn't hang out with the clinicians, my standing slipped. 

Every once in a while, we would hear what the clinicians thought of us when a popular student would let us know what was going on. 

If you think school is full of backstabbers and mean, cliqued-out techs, you are definitely not prepared for the real world. And wait until clients turn on you when something goes wrong. And your boss turns on you when your clients complain. 

You are just here trying to help an animal feel better and there are 15 people doing Pink Floyd ""The Wall"" jeering and mockery and making you feel stupid for ever entertaining the thought of doing something good in the world.I sit for eye surgery. Sometimes for PU sx.Do you have access to previous tests? That’s how e we did it back in the 90s.I had our local shelter in my kennels for about 10 years. I thought it was extremely depressing and frustrating because people are stupid and thoughtless about their pets. We had county workers bring in litters of puppies dumped out in the country with a bag of dog food, we had a litter of kittens duct taped in a shoe box found in our park, I could go on and on. Horrible, disgusting things people do to animals is shameful. But that also makes it rewarding, knowing that YOU can do something for these animals, that they will have a warm place to sleep with food, water, medical treatments if needed, and possibly a new home. We are a no-kill shelter. 

As far as the veterinary part, most shelters have limited funds for vet expenses, so you have to get used to being very selective in what you get to do for sick animals or injured animals. There really is no typical day unless you extablish certain hours for intake, surgeries, or examining existing shelter animals. My day as a solo practice doc starts with surgery in the morning, but a dog fight emergency or someone dropping off a vomiting cat can throw a monkey wrench into the schedule. I think shelter medicine will make you feel happy about those animals you can rehome, but knowing how horrible people can be to animals is something that not everyone can process without being disturbed.Do you have access to previous tests? They were valuable to us when studying for exams, and to see what the instructors thought was important enough to test us on.Tangent here on hereditary problems. Why do we forbid breeding dogs with umbilical hernias but don’t dissuade people who breed dogs with bad skin?DVM here, I have tattoos of my parents' writing on my arm where people see it all the time. My receptionist has tats all over her. No one cares anymore.I use metro a lot for diarrhea and will confirm that it resolves diarrhea.Cat neuters ALWAYS get suture ligatures, usually gut. 

Dog neuters: up until a Reddit post a while back, I did open castrations with gut ligatures on pretty much everything. Now if I neuter a puppy with a tiny or nonexistent scrotum, I do a scrotal neuter, which was suggested to me a couple years ago by a Redditor!

Spays, I just ligate circumferential with gut 2 times on most pedicles, and on fat dogs, big dogs, pyos, in heat I will do 2 ligatures of transfixation. 3 layers to close abdomen, PDS.I'm an old-timer, graduated in 1993. I like how gut kind of sticks to itself when it gets a little blood on it. No slipping like PDS or Vicryl. I did have to repair a hernia that a cow vet put in a dog abdominal closure. 

What do you do if you don't spay dogs? I do this daily.It warms my heart to see that someone else uses the verb ""anal glanded.""It means that you had a dog/cat express its anal glands on you resulting in a horrid stench stuck to your clothes for the rest of the day.I can understand isolating a parvo dog in a little room, my iso is pretty small too. But if it’s the room where clean towels and drapes come out of that will come into contact with puppies, that’s not a good idea. 

I worked for for 2 AAHA hospitals and both of them reused autoclaved syringes. I saw several abscesses from that practice.We had tests every week on Tuesday and Friday mornings. Every single week for 3 years. Final week wasn’t a major stressor because we were already accustomed to taking tests all the time.If they decline tests, that's on them 100%. You put that in the medical record, right? And spays bleed. We all know that.When I was in vet school, a gift card for groceries would have been nice. Or for clothes, shoes, books.

defiroose,">Running a residential node doesn't doesn't have much of a cost since you are already paying for the services you will be using

Maybe true, but the cost is not nothing because of human capital plus electricity. This cost is certainly more than $1 a month. Thus it's not break-even for some people.

That leaderboard is quite insightful. It illustrates the high centralization of the network. The majority of nodes are earning very little income. Only a few are earning income that'd make running a node worthwhile. The bigger trouble is, the nodes with the highest income are from countries with high cost of living. This further reduces the incentivization for node operators because those incomes are more appealing to people living in low cost of living countries, yet those incomes aren't possible to obtain for those who'd desire it.

Without some major improvements, it's hard to envision this being sustainable in the long term. It comes down to relying on volunteers. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xmjgka/tested_running_a_node_for_a_month/ippajma/","Other.

Tiniesthair,"I was a traditional student but followed a non-traditional path. MPH was my backup plan before vet school. It depends what you want out of life. What do you think you’ll do with the MPH once you have it?

I am a boarded lab animal vet. I find the work extremely rewarding, there’s a mix of exotic animals, pathology, and research. You can probably make your career what you want. It’s high paying—though you have to be okay with tiered elevation (meaning usually you are hired as a clinical vet and promoted up), there is technically an experience route without residency (note: boards are tough without but not impossible), you can get grants and run your own studies if that suites you, there is a lot of pathology involved if you are interested, work-life balance is phenomenal, university or pharma company benefits, and a lot of residencies set you up with an MPH anyway.It’s totally fair and not for everyone—but I can confidently say that I euthanize less animals in lab animal than in practice and also, they need healthcare too!

I hope things work out for you!You’re definitely a real vet! I’m a lab animal vet, and sadly sometimes you hear these things being said. But the truth is that just comes from unhappy, insecure people. What are you getting a PhD in? 

Also, if you are itching for clinical practice, try working some vaccine clinics when you can or try out relief. On top of some clinical work, you will be able to supplement your PhD “wages.”I totally hear you. But you are also a newer grad, I assume — and honestly just being in the field for more years, you will soak up knowledge and skills if you drive yourself to learn and put yourself in positions for hands on experience! You will also have a new skill of running a clinical trial which is well sought after and sometime lucrative! You’re just carving out your niche— it will be great, you will see!Reach out to the MBL in woods hole — the AV there is amazing. She may have some ideas!I think it is important to remember that grades are not everything. Do well yes — but there were so many people in my class that would FIGHT to get for example a 96/100 instead of their 93/100 etc. And they would be so stressed out. 

Literally at the end of the first year of vet school, my roommate and I were kicked out of the condo we were sharing with another classmate. Her reasoning was that she was a straight A student and my roommate and had gotten a few Bs. She went on to be completely miserable the rest of the 3 year and my roommate and I really enjoyed vet school. My roommate and I went on to be specialists of different kinds and she went into GP. GP is great, don’t get me wrong— but there is no reason to be so fixated on grades if you are not trying to specialize. And even if you do specialize, a few Bs won’t ruin your career!","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

100realtx,"If you like the industry but don’t care for the pay an employee in a clinic makes you can always look at industry roles. Idexx,zoetis,Heska,petdesk, there are thousands of veterinary companies out there that offer better pay and allow you to still be in the field. Although not in practice…There is a lower the dose campaign from idexx. You can find it on the website I am sure. They also sell the only digital radiology system that requires half the radiation dose than that of a traditional system. Pretty cool technology, maybe your clinic is willing to check it out.Y’all wild. I’ll let y’all continue to swirl around this toilet bowl of a discussion. Sorry to derail your question op. The pile of shit being left here isn’t getting you anywhere closer to finding a worthwhile associate/partner. And to the clown that deleted their posts….foreshame. Internet is full of unworthy trolls and you’ve proven one.Bless all your hearts. This isn’t a difficult game to figure out. Y’all seem to be too dense to look for a viable solution that involves compromises. Only dvms I know that are unhappy are corporate dvms that have to abide by the corp bullshit that anyone has a dislike for. You ain’t happy where you at then fix it. Quit complying. 

This poor clinic just askin about how to find a vet now has to weed thru all this bullshit for no real answer other than find a non lgbtqia+-= male dvm. Otherwise it seems like a headache.It is disappointing  to feel like the work ethic of this industry has declined over the last 20 years. 15 years ago new grads could expect base $55k with about 6/7% production. Now they are getting $100k 2/4% production with much better benefits and work life balance. Not to mention the sign on bonus that corporate groups are giving the new grads. All tides turn in time. I think you’ve got a hell of an offer regardless of what the states reproductive rights are.TouchéWhen the commenters here merely state TEXAS!?!? Fuck texas and their anti feminist anti gay bullshit? Clearly that’s someone watching too much news and not living day to day here. Op didn’t even mention extended benefits and everyone slammed it as it’s a texas problem. It’s not a texas problem. Obviously it’s a workforce problem when the women are too scared or stubborn or both to come to a place that will pay them fairly. As op stated a pretty fair wage as far as I’m considered and still not knowing exact details.Never once did I say pull anything up by any bootstraps. Y’all putting words in my mouth. And vary rarely is an abortion life threatening. To wait a week or less to travel to an area that allows it isn’t difficult. Please stay wherever you are and advocate whatever you want. This tribalism of red vs blue is only compounding this and many other issues.If you can’t abort an unwanted pregnancy shouldn’t you be taking the act of unprotected sex into consideration as well. Don’t want a baby? There’s ways to prevent it to begin with….You can always travel for repro rights. Not a difficult concept. And most Texans don’t give a shit what you identify as as long as you don’t push your shit on us who cares what you do. Turn the tv off and have some conversations with people. The difference isn’t a wide gap and we tend to agree on most things. Y’all too worried about what msnbc or fox as to say about it. Their are not our puppet, or yours. Quit acting like it. And yeah I do believe the system can change. I’ve seen it happen. I’ve lived the change. To discount a place because of international food? You have clearly never experienced the vast culinary melting pot of many texas cities. Too stuck in your own existence to experience what different places have to offer. Keep yourself where you are it’s your mindset that keeps shit stagnant.I question your intelligence in the face of your advanced degree. Learn the industry and you may surprise yourself. Fucking clowns.Supply and demand affect these rates the most. Start hurting for vets the wages go up. Also the type of medicine they practice matter. Small animal vs large animal, ecg.Soooo if 15 years ago the going rate for a new grad was $55k and now, most places I deal with are offering $100k…… it’s not quite double but pretty darn close. Seems like pay is keeping up with most things. Again you don’t like your current situation, there are others to be had. There is just a lack of doing so for whatever reason you want to point out. I most commonly see what I see.To say politics is the reason they can’t hire anyone is flat bullshit that only the weak and simple minded allow them to let it affect them like that.I would question her place of employment instead of the state she lived in. That’s dumb.I wouldn’t require someone to do something with their body they didn’t want to. It’s not my decision. And if the govt says it’s a must, well time to adapt right? I personally wouldn’t fire someone because they chose to or not to get something that’s voluntary. I helped my people look for alternatives to vaccination. Medical/religious exemptions. Flat saying no thanks no poke for me. I let my people choose. Honestly great point! Maybe we will implement some sort of compensation for women in my org that need to travel to get the medical care they require. I could even implement it for the opposite of women that need help getting pregnant. Looky here something positive from this shit storm.Lol obviously not. But if I found myself in that situation I’ve got bigger fish to fry than an unwanted pregnancy. If that’s your true worry maybe you should reassess your surroundings…possibly a state that allows open carry of a firearm might deter any unsavory types that could lead to said unwanted pregnancies?Okurrr. Just look at movement maps during Covid. One of the most blue states, California, had more residents move from there to texas… Jesus y’all need to pop another ssri and chill. How do you think those drugs y’all are on for such a hard life y’all have had affect a fetus?Never said I wanted them to that it was justified that they made that. It’s much different now especially in my area of texas, the average salary is $100k plus production for even a new grad.My reason and logic seem to confuse even the most basic of individuals. My intelligence should a always be questioned. As should yours. If we are not flexing the gray matter on a daily basis we are but withering away.That’s ignorant to leave the industry because your not getting paid what you are worth. Find a place that will pay. They are everywhere. Of the 1000 plus vet clinics in my part of the world 80% are looking for a dvm and will pay $100K + incentives. Open your eyes. Either that or these drs leaving want to work 10-4 with a 2 hour lunch and 2 months pto. Oh and only want vaccine appointments because they aren’t comfortable in sx or more difficult cases. That’s the lack of gumption I speak of.No one said to take out student loans. I know dvms that floated their schooling and I know ones that did take loans out and paid it off in 3 years because they busted ass. The way some of these commenters are talking they be living at the clinic so what mortgage? (Joking don’t downvote me more). Sure things are more expensive I get that, everyone feels that bite. But if your wages in the profession are up you should still just as easily meet those obligations just as the dvms of 15 years ago did. I’m no math expert but I can do that math.As the saying goes scared money don’t make money. It’s like saying I won’t work in Houston because of greenspoint. Well why not Conroe instead? Might as well not go to New York either since we ship both the immigrants and our stray dog population there. Oh no, the migrant flow continuesssssssIt’s only hostile to them because they let it be. Ok my state says I can or can’t do something, doesn’t mean I have to abide by that. I bet you never speed do you? That’s the state telling you what you can and can’t do with your body too isn’t it? A bit oversimplified but the same concept. Y’all too worried about red vs blue or they vs them. You do you boo but please stay the fuck away from this state and it’s wonderful people. There’s a saying for a reason, don’t California my Texas. The anger and downvotes I’ve gotten in this thread is hilarious. All the while I just laugh continue about my day. I bet y’all going home and crying to your spouse about the unhinged asshole on Reddit. Cry into your pillow, no one cares.Idk if you read my last comment. I literally just said I would like to look into compensation for women that require or want such care. It’s not their fault texas has this issue and they shouldn’t suffer, no one should, because of it. I’m not denying anything. If anything I’m looking to facilitate their choice…even would like to go as far as helping the women whom want to become pregnant that can’t… I fail to see your issue here.Please read above. I stated I helped my people find alternatives. Religious and medical exemptions… I fail to see the issue…Daily. I welcome it. If I don’t challenge my customers and they don’t challenge me it’s a boring life. Hell, if I don’t challenge myself how boring. I’ll be the first to admit when I’m wrong as well. Hence how I’ve made it to where I am in life and in this industry. Just because I don’t have some advanced degree from some prestigious institution doesn’t mean I lack in intelligence. I’ve given my life to this industry just as many veterinarians have. I’m not so pretentious that I can’t see the Forrest for the trees. This answer is simple. Your undervalued and overworked? GO SOMEWHERE ELSE! The clinic you work at isn’t the only one, it’s not your only option. Not in Texas, not in Idaho. No matter where you are or want to be there are many options for yourself. You just have to take the initiative, rely on yourself, no one else.If you can’t afford to live and work where you currently are, and feel undervalued I would imagine doubling your base salary and increasing your other benefits would entice you to make the move across the country. No high horse just the reality of where I am at. I’m not happy where I’m at or getting paid what I’m worth I’m actively looking for a place I will be satisfied. Simple as that. And maybe they would off themselves if they realized that was an opportunity.16 I know paid it off within 3 years. All of them in the last 8 years. How did they pay it off within 3 years of graduation you ask? By busting their ass and living below their means. Taking extra shifts at other hospitals. Hell one of them worked in industry, worked overnight ec and lived like they were in college still. It can happen. It does happen. Funny thing is we can circle back to work ethic and gumption. Those that choose to pay their loans off over the long haul, typically lack some of those two qualities. Or extenuating circumstances create issues paying off loans that fast. The power of simple math fired the ass busters up and they made it happen for themselves.Yes customers. I spent 10 years in practice. In every role. As a industry consultant I speak with customer, vet clinics, all over the country. I advise them to stay away from and to not hire clown acts like yourself. Just because I currently reside here doesn’t mean my view point would be different if I lived somewhere else. Like when I lived in California for 6 years. Still a consultant in the industry I directed my customer, clients, what have you on how to best run their business. Staying away from problem or toxic employees is at the top of the list. If you are a veterinarian I feel terrible for your clients and your business. Maybe it’s not suffering now but a room full of toxic bullshit always boils over.I haven’t screamed once. And considering I’ve had to weather all types of economic storms I’m pretty well versed on it. Also, thanks for assuming the adversities I have faced in life. But if you must know my back story here’s a snippet. Grew up poor, busted my ass to put myself thru school and worked tirelessly for an industry I love and have literally almost died for. Yet I’m still here fighting the good fight. Politics be damned.I would check diagnostic and distribution companies. There’s all types of remote dvm roles. Something like idexx, telehealth or corporate veterinary groups. Not sure if any of those are in Germany but it’s worth a shot.","Other.

nothinggoingonhere77,"there are vet clinics that pay much more for a vet-tech, it can get as high as 38$ per H.this is the thing, you need to stand up for yourself, and it is ture that the area s very important, but i see many vet tech that are underpaid in places like LA or Austin.  
paying your teh well is very important for a good practice.i know that some of the mobile euthanasia vets are doing it as part time and the rest of the weekly hours they do at a normal or mobile clinic.  
you can do that as well.I had a hard time at uni, and my way of coping was talking to friends that are not in uni and venting to them.

Adventurous_Pear_711,"I can tell you, as someone who is currently IN vetschool. From experience, it’s not about whether or not you can do it, if you want it and this is interesting to you, you will get it. No doubt. The hard part is knowing that aquatic vet stuff is going to not be a major part of the curriculum. You can find externships and things once you start getting into clinical rotations or maybe even before that if you’re lucky to land yourself in a state school with summers off. The issue that I think most people need to consider about vet med is the very toxic nature of the profession. I’ve posted about this and I’m extremely passionate about changing this because I simply cannot exist in a space where my passion for medicine has been squeezed out of me by the soul crushing behavior of others. Because you will encounter it at some point. You need to be able to decide if you can handle that and if you’re going to join the people who want to change it. I encourage you to find employment at a place you someday want to work as a vet. You will feel out what it’s like, build connections and potential externship/ job opportunities for the future :) if all else fails you can still save animals without a DVM so figure out how to get to where you want to be and start walking your path.I understand the whole “put your head down and get out there” mentality but… something should be done about this. It’s unfortunate it’s become this way and honestly I wouldn’t even know where to start. It’s insane to me how people consider this school “reputable” in anyway. It sounds like you have PTSD; how the hell is someone going to pay thousands of dollars for abuse.Can I ask what department you’re in? 🥹But like how do you do that? It seems like the person you’d report to would likely just tell you to “suck it up” there’s a major issue here with the “bully’s” having too much power. I’m seriously asking thoThank you for sharing your story. I’m really sorry you had this experience. I’m really sad to learn this is considered the actual “norm”. It really impresses on me that we need to be the change. This HAS got to stop.This especially sucks to hear because those vets all went through this; and you either end up bitter and calloused or in emotional turmoil and extend compassion as a result. Like honestly. You havnt “earned the right” to be an asshole. It speaks more about a person who has been dragged through absolute shit only to remain compassionate and caring of their fellow humans.None of those schools will say anything about the culture and they generally have “deals” with the schools for being able to place students there, so even if they said they had insight; they don’t. I was told multiple times by a Ross professor before I started that they’ve “been to the school multiple times and they’re good friends with “so and so” and how wonderful things were. When I got here, during my orientation I was asked about Ross; I said “oh you’ll know this professor they come here a lot and is friends with___” I was told “that person was here twice for maybe two days. 🧐 like every step of this whole process is just lies. I don’t understand it. As a whole Purdue will stop at nothing to protect their reputation, not actually do something to benefit the people living in it. It’s hard as a student, everyone is afraid to say something to risk their degree or get some sort of backlash. So the people who CAN say something generally don’t. I will say the clinician that’s the higher up in the ICU/ECC department needs to go. 🖖 and the anesthesia department needs serious evaluation. I’m talking mostly about the techs.Word around the campfire is they had to pull all the tech students from a certain rotation because they were getting treated so badly. Huge amount of people are quitting now and many departments are super short staffed, but they’re keeping the exact same case loadYou would be correctThat’s amazing, it’s so frustrating that vetschool is highly variable as far as what the requirements are with the exact same end goal.Yes, sorry!I’m really sorry. There things I wish I would have known before coming here for sure. Ross tends not to be entirely transparent with its students regarding rotations. Welcome to the shit storm.I’ve heard this a lot.I get that, but I think that mentality is the problem (no offense here at all) I just think creating a situation where you tell yourself “it is what it is” and “this is normal” just perpetuates everyone’s bad behavior. It shouldn’t be this way, and because it was that way for someone before me, doesn’t mean it should be this way today. Vet med is hard, vets commit suicide. Like in high numbers. You’re career starts here; and this constant abuse even if it’s for a whole freaking year, takes a major toll on mental health. I don’t want to get a mediocre job after graduation thinking it’s amazing because no one is as bad as what I experienced at Purdue.I never thought I’d say I miss ross, but I miss Ross. For reference.I’m glad your experience was good overall; thanks for sharing your experience. I will never understand making students work 10+ hours while also having a lot of other extemporaneous objectives, papers, presentations, exams (other academic requirements that need a lot of time devoted outside of those hours) plus being on call and preparing daily for questions! it makes no sense. NO ONE learns well when stressed and exhausted, and certainly no one is capable of giving 100% being pushed to the limits. What’s even the point of that? I get choosing a job that might require those kinds of hours, but after a good education where youre able to rest, and retain things so you can be better prepared for long hours on the job. We need to be learning how to set healthy boundaries. Also, Ross students are forced to track mixed even if you want nothing to do with large animal. There are certainly similar things happening today as what you describe back then unfortunatelyThat’s fair; I’m not miserable in general. I think my life circumstance has impacted me a great deal. The sacrifices and the hoops are so much greater. I’ve gone back and forth about what I’d do instead and honestly, that only adds to the anxiety of all of this. I’d first need to address the state of my mental health, which is certainly suffering. I don’t have the most helpful or kind husband and he’s the reason for a lot of the time I’ve taken off from school already. To be honest I’m so guilty at the thought of leaving our kids with him 24/7 as he has a short temper and yells at a 3 year old. I worry about their own mental and emotional well being constantly. Granted, finishing this I’d be able to be more independent faster, but the cost of that for nearly a year of them being exposed to that breaks me. It’s triggering as well as my parents were awful to me as a kid, my mom was never around and I’d be left home with the latest abusive dead beat step dad. It’s caused a lot of my issues I have as an adult. Including the anxiety I feel in finishing this at what I feel

Jazzylizard19,"Inability to afford treatment is not convenience euthanasia. It is a very justifiable reason to euthanize. It's more compassionate than letting the animal continue to suffer because of lack of fundsHuman medicine and veterinary medicine are funded in two entirely different ways. Hardly anyone would choose that route if it were funded the same way human med is. With all due respect, have you ever been in that situation?

NVCoates,"This is the comment I've been looking for.Speaking with someone at Vets4Vets may help you. They are veterinarians who are trained mental health counselors. It's free, paid for through the non-profit VIN foundation. 

https://vinfoundation.org/resources/vets4vets/""I'm very interested in your offer, and I think I would be a great fit here. However, there's one importing sticking point. I'm not entertaining offers for pro-sal with negative accrual. Is this negotiable on your end?""

And be prepared to walk away if they say no.UMN 2009. And same, same, same.I would rather render aid to the degree that I am able and be ""wrong"" than let someone die through my inaction. At the end of the day, you have to live with your conscience. 

That being said, I've had 20 years to see who does and who doesn't lose their vet license. It takes a lot.

In terms of being sued, those egregious cases are newsworthy because they are rare. I have to believe that most people are reasonable.  If I didn't, I wouldn't be able to live in this society.This is good advice! Relief work is a great way to try out a practice before you commit. And if you do like them, most likely they are hiring!Many years ago, a wise old vet said to me,  ""I just tell them, 'You can pay me now or you can pay me later, but later will cost more.'"" Meaning, I know what you will have to do to fix this. Do you want to trust me and do it now, or come back when foofoo dust doesn't work and the condition is 10x worse?

Other old favorites include, ""That's not going to work, but you can try it.""

And, ""You can't care more than the client does.""Who is responsible for training you? 

If the answer is, ""I don't know,"" then speak to the manager and find out.

If the answer is, ""No one,"" speak to the manager and tell them you need a trainer.

If the answer is, ""Everyone,"" that's the same as no one. Everyone's job is no one's job.

If the answer is a specific person or couple of people, these are the people you should be asking when you don't know what to do.

I'm a senior doctor, and I frequently see this with inexperienced, newly hired support staff. They come to me for training for very basic things because I'm the person in charge. However, I have a lot of responsibilities, including training newly grad doctors. I work about 60 hours a week. There are two RVTs who have been assigned to train them. They are the people to ask. I do not provide OTJ training to newly hired assistants. If I did, I would never go home. 

This is my perspective. If you want to continue this job, when you are asked to do something you don't know how to do, ask your trainer. The doctors are busy doctoring. They are not here to nurture your soul.This is dictated by your contract and, like everything in your contract, is potentially negotiable.This is my reason, tooYikes. A lot of these responses seem to be missing the point. These cameras are being put in exam rooms, not for security, but expressly to micromanage OP's exams. That can be incredibly intimidating,  especially for someone who is self-conscious or camera shy. For some people, it could actually cause them to perform worse because they are constantly thinking about management hanging over their shoulder.

I think the best way to get on top of it would be to meet with management and to ask them what is triggering this change and what their specific performance concerns are. If they have specific concerns and they seem to be legitimate [e.g., clients' complaints about communication (legit) vs. you aren't selling enough wellness plans (gimme a break,)] propose an alternative. If they say they don't have any concerns, they are just 'looking for ways to improve,' tell them you have concerns about it adversely affecting your performance. If they won't listen, find a job that will listen to you.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

BCam4602,"Not a vet but in reception at one where we’re so slow I’ve been dialed back to 25-27 hr/wk vs 33-38. We are expensive and won’t give ballpark pricing of basic procedures like spays/neuters. Most inquiries don’t book when they can’t get an answer. We have space for surgeries next week; when I was hired last June we were at least three weeks out.

Meanwhile, the clinic half a mile down the road that is well known for being inexpensive hasn’t taken new clients in over 7 years and we are getting clients from them because their spays/neuters are booked out until late fall. They are bleeding clients because they can’t keep up with demand with three vets to our one.

We charge $75+ for a feline leukemia vaccine that costs about $12. Is this normal? Our spays/neuters are on the high side. Can a practice’s pricing drive business down like this?Yesterday we did a follow up exam after a dental referral to a specialist, plus two vaccines. $206.00. The woman about fell over. We saw the cat shortly prior to the referral so should the follow up be full price ($83)? Normally we discount the exam fee when vaccines are given but didn’t on this one for some reason. We are pricing ourselves out of business. 😞That should be mitigated by explaining the extraneous conditions that could drive the price up. The next statement is “these will be determined upon exam.”  I would say a majority of the prospective clients who call asking for a ballpark and don’t get one end up elsewhere.I agree with that on the whole but there are extraneous reasons I hesitate to. This is affecting my attitude, though. Since our tech throws out claims that every practice is this way, I just wanted to see how true that was.Thank youWell, at this point in time with my hours cut significantly because we are slow, I have noticed that a significant proportion of queries about general cost of spays and neuters fail to book an appointment.

Now there is rumor that the practice is considering adding a tech appointment fee on top of the cost of vaccines. We are charging about $75 for a feline leukemia vaccine as it is. I understand needing to generate income to support the practice but increasing costs in a slow environment seems like a shoot your own foot solution.Thank you. It’s leaving a bad taste in my mouth. As a pet owner of multiple pets I have always had to be cost conscious but this practice acts as though if they have to ask then we don’t want them. Yet now our hours are dramatically cut because it is so slow.

TH3R3V3R3ND,"Here’s my 2 cents: way too many people view VetPrep as like a completion competition and it becomes mindless question regurg (not vomiting those two are different 😝) instead of any real learning. I passed only having completed ~40% of VetPrep because I didn’t do any of the timed exams and focused all my attention on the regular questions where I made a google doc and typed out a sentence or two reinforcing the key concept of each one as I answered it, right or wrong. As you do this you strengthen recall from the multimodal approach of typing and thinking, plus you end up with a giant reference you can control F for quick recall and making connections to new material as you encounter it. For example if I was on pig diarrhea or something I’d control F salmonella to see if I had a reference to it in chickens, and if not incorporate that at the time.

Their tokenomics favors a few and not all  


Their should not be 1 type of node runner being favored over another, also a simple weekly update video goes a long way for persons who actually believe in the project will have issues in which we hear nothing except with stupid updates that means nothing to us like a. sudo dao... like bro literally when that was announced half of the node runners left..

How do you know that marketing is targeted in specific regions have you seen it or is it something that was said by the team (not being rude its a genuine question).  


The lack of transparency especially with the 20% cut and how its being used is crazy shady when you're not seeing the growth or progress.

NoAnt5675,"I had something similar. I did an internship and then did another internship at a different hospital (equine) and one of the assistants thought she was the bee's knees. She questioned literally everything I did. Pass an NG tube different from what she was taught? I was wrong. Euthanize a horse? I'm wrong. I eventually found out that she had been an assistant and only started working there literally a few months before me. She quit and that was the end of that. Work through it and if they want to nit pick and question everything, respond with facts of why you're doing something a particular way. Maybe they'll learn a bew technique or something. If it's really bothering you, you could probably get a new job somewhere else too.I don't think it's useful. Most vets that are willing to use a gun will either have their own or clients want to do it themselves. Also 90% of the time the animal is approachable and you can sedate them either IV or IM. If not, most people (at least in my area) hunt big game (elk, moose) and they're going to shoot it with that they already have. Also, it's kind of a liability to carry a gun. If someone breaks into my truck while I'm at the store or getting gas who's responsible for the gun? Another thing to consider is if the gun misfires or goes through the animal and hits something/someone else? A captive bolt gun is probably the safest option there is.I live and work in the wilds of Idaho and Montana. If I'm not looking for a gun, I doubt you're going to find anyone else looking for that gun. Good luck.This. I was out of school for over a year and had 2 active licenses. It took them 3 months to approve my NY one. My internmate from Japan took almost a year and he had to take a chemistry exam. Just FYI if anyone went to a school out of the country, be ready to either take exams or do extra paper work (yes this includes AVMA approved Dublin and Edinburg)Oh thank god. That whole thing was just ridiculous. You can have a license in literally the other 49 states but you need to sit for their chem class.I think it might depend on the workload and salary but I'm going to go against the others. I did an equine internship where I was on call 24 hrs a day for 6 days a week and was expected to work all 6 days. I had 1 day a week off. My boss thought that I should have come in on my 1 day off a week and shadowed another doctor. My ""internship"" was me running around and covering emergencies and any other ""intern task"" that the regular doctors didn't want to deal with. My mentorship was a ""phone call away"". For the amount of stress, aggravation, and sh*t pay, it wasn't worth the one day a week sacrifice for my mental health. I think going in one day every few weeks or every once in a blue moon isn't a big deal but giving someone time off and expecting them to come in repeatedly is kind of ridiculous. Like don't contract someone for 4 days a week and then be upset that they are choosing to use their other 3 days for something else. There are other jobs that will train you on the job and not during your days off. Maybe you should find one of them. 
If anyone wants to argue with me over internships, learning, and after hours experience, my class in 2020 had 6 students do an equine internship. Only 3 of us are still doing equine not even 4 years later. 2 left right after their internship because they were burnt out and they didn't go back to equine.That and the pay for a rural large animal vet is laughable. I'll be taking these loans to the grave with my salary. USDA VMLRP? Need a lawyer to understand the application 🙄Seriously, 4 years of school/stress vs a lifetime of debt and financial stress. There's a light at the end of the tunnel for school. This $324k? I have no idea what I'm going to do about it lolThis one is tricky. There probably are jobs that are pretty sports med specific, but they're probably few and far between. These jobs will probably look to hire residents who are board eligible before they hire someone with a certificate. However, you can get a GP job without doing dentals and surgery and can offer that you can do more sports rehab stuff in exchange for the lack of surgery. Also, there's traveling surgeons, so it could be possible to become a traveling sports med vet.Yeah take this advice. Don't do food animal or equine. The pay sucks, the hours suck, and some days you do bangs vaccines in -25F (-31C) because ""the hubby is home"" and they refuse to reschedule🥲. I like my job but at the rate it's going, I'm hoping for government collapse before I can pay these loans off.In fact I feel like I just get more broke the longer I'm in this job. Why does food animal pay so little. You would think since we're out here taking care of everyone's food we would get a break but nope. I just want to pay my loans off and maybe get a small house to live in. 🤷‍♀️🥲I went to LMU. It has its pros and cons. I did more spay surgeries than my equine internmate. I did 4 spays by the end of my 3rd year. She went to another school with a teaching hospital, and she only did 1/2 a spay the entire time she was there. She tracked large animal but that still doesn't matter. I also had a lot of 1 on 1 with other vets doing surgeries and working in clinics. I feel like that was super beneficial. Would it have been cool to spend 2 weeks or whatever in neuro or some other specialty? Sure but I don't know if learning how to do all those specialty surgeries would help. I feel like I got screwed when it came to equine and food animal though. Equine places wouldn't let us do anything because ""that's what internships are for"". And I didn't really do any food animal stuff and the one class we had was minimal anything. I did do a few DA surgeries at a clinic I was visiting after covid shut everything down and it was something I did in my own not even through the school. 

Also took out a F ton of loan debt and now work in Large animal so there's that. My instate was Cornell. I only applied there because it was my instate and it was going to take a miracle to get in. NY could have had another large animal vet that was born and raised there but nope 😂

Also not gonna lie, the fact that Arizona tried to get accreditation before LMU was a thing and still struggled after makes me think that school might be sketch. Nothing against the students, but I would be careful.Agreed. Large animal vet in Idaho. Make less than my classmates, definitely work longer hours and the COL is ridiculous. Hopefully I can get that USDA repayment plant but that's pretty much what I'm relying on right now. Also single and will probably stay that way🥲Nope it's in the US. Some states require vets to either be available for emergencies or list where pets can go for an emergency if they are closed. It depends on the state. What state are you in?Probably depends on what part of Cali. I know this because I have a few classmates that work in California at various emergency clinics. Same thing could be said about a lot of places including ,Idaho, Montana and Wyoming. Just expect it if you live in a rural area. I live in Idaho and if it's after 9pm, you're driving easily over 2 hours. It's even worse with a horse. It's easily 3+ hour drive if you need colic surgery.Same. Large animal exclusive in north ldaho with 60-70% equine. Only make 90k. I may cross over into the 100k due to ER bonus but yeah. I also qualify for USDA so guess who's going to be utilizing that for the next 10 years..  ETA, I'm a woman working in a women run practice with literally all women if any of that information is relevant.Just don't go into large animal because even though most of the country wants their steaks amd bacon, no one wants to pay the vet that keeps the pre-steaks and bacon seeds healthy.Yeah it's unfortunate but I do only work 4 days a week with 1 weekend on call every 3 weeks. And I'm on call 1 night a week with a rotating Monday so the flexibility is there to do small animal vaccine clinics to earn some extra money. I will also probably take on some ownership in the next couple of years due to one Dr being over 60 and the other being over 50.. I'm only 29😂I has two internships. One required me to be on call 6 days a week, the other was 24/7 literally. Neither one paid over 50k.A lot of jobs are advertised as $100k but have they actually got anyone to apply to them? I work in large animal and make 90k. I also have $325k in student loan debt. The COL here is ridiculous as well. COL is also something to consider. If it's $100k in NYC or Southern CA, that's a joke. Salary has increased significantly over the lat 10 years but you still have people making less than some of the jobs advertised. If a job is offering a lot (huge sign on bonus, huge salary etc), there's a reason it might not be filled.Large animal who did 2 equine internships. I feel ya.Wait till they start calling you and just assume everyone lives on the east coast. I had a recruiter call me at 5am one day. I called her back and told her to take me off her list and next time do her research and Google my name. A simple Google would tell you that I live in pacific time.I haven't left the profession and I don't know any that did but I do know a few that have changed courses significantly within the last few years. Most of them are/were large animal/equine that went into small animal or academics. I had a few classmates do one internship for equine and then the next jobs were small animal and clinical skills for college. Not sure if that helps but teaching seems to be the big thing outside of typical clinical work. ETA . I'm a 2020 grad.I found the guy posting on Facebook. You can go to the clinic, go to reviews and read it. The original poster sounds like an idiot🙄Vet responded on the Facebook page of the clinic to the review that OP left.Same. I can't post pictures eitherAlso they seem to come with a lot of strings attached.They asked why they couldn't hire anyone and got an answer. Sorry, the problems that are making hiring difficult are beyond their control. Unless they're going to offer things like ""will pay to help you get *medical care OOS* and not risk your job"", I'm not sure what else they can do when the reason someone doesn't want to move there is political.People literally move all the time for any reason. I live in Idaho. The amount of people that moved there from literally any other state (mainly California) because ""freedom"" is significant. So yes, people will move for political reasons.The same could be said about Californians leaving California. When COVID hit and everyone flocked cities to more rural areas and protested a vaccine, what do you think of that? Or when people left the health care field because they refused to get vaccinated. I've been vaccinated but I know people that refused to do that and it's their choice but do you feel the same way about them leaving due to personal health issues?So what about women who want abortions because the baby/fetus/child is literally suffering? Should you take a gamble and see how long the baby will live past birth? We took an oath to do no harm. We euthanize things daily for a variety of reasons. Heck I've aborted dogs and cats while being spayed. You say you want people to choose, and Kate cox literally can't choose to abort her own child that has a very high chance of dying within the first two weeks of life without being charged as a criminal. You are fine with letting a child be born and suffer until it dies. This is the problem. Don't sit there and say you would let your people choose and say how great your state is and then deny the right of a woman to choose to abort her suffering child.My point is the state says XYZ and unless the clinic backs up the potential employee and helps them, they're not going to gamble in a state that says xyz.Lmu had ""finals"" but for most of the classes if you studied all semester and had A/B for all the other tests, you would literally have to not show up to fail. Like for the most part the finals were just whatever lectures we just finished because we had other exams. On one hand it seems like we studied a lot but at the same time it wasn't like my future depended on two exams. Edit to add, like instead of a mid term/final, we had like 3-7 exams for the whole semester depending on the subject and how many lectures. One health that had like maybe 15 lectures total a semester? Three exams. Small animal medicine with like 50 lectures for one semester of a two semester class had like 7-8 exams.","Other.

I ask because I once noticed my fellow techs treating a new doc like this and  I couldn't figure out why.

Both docs were more than competent, I even moved my pet's care to the first new doc.  Both were easy to work with and great people.

I asked a few techs what was up and I can't recall what was said (this was decades ago) but I concluded that it had to be that the first doc was ridiculously good-looking.  Like 10/10, stepped off the runway.

pissedpringle,"I did a combined DVM/MPH and would not want to have one without the other. Second year of vet school during COVID I was so burnt out and strongly considered taking a leave of absence or dropping out completely to pursue straight public health (even at a school with huge emphasis on non-clinical careers). I am glad that I didn't because I think it has made me both a better clinician and public health professional, while opening countless doors. There are so many opportunities outside of clinical medicine, and people who are willing to help, even if your advisor isn't. Please feel free to DM me; vet school is hard, especially when you feel like you are alone.I went to Virginia -Maryland which is home to the Center of Public and Corporate Veterinary Medicine (which I believe also does a career transitions program) . I currently am working corporate ER for clinical experience (and the significantly better pay) with the game plan of transitioning back to public health after 2-3 years. I was lucky to find great mentors through side projects that turned into jobs (think local health departments, non-profits, etc) as well as within the university.

SpecialistKick7304,This thread is depresso lol. There’s a Facebook account called debt-free vets with tons of vets giving personal experience of paying off debt and advice! I highly recommend. But I also agree that tuition in US vet schools Is rising exponentially. I would stick with an in state option or shop around out of country even. I go to vet school in the UK because it’s slightly cheaper and fixed cost. I don’t think any school over 50K/year is worth it really.

asszilla17,"Could be a sign of unorganized management… I would think in the current climate, ANY practice or manager would be very prompt and respectful of a candidates time. It is so competitive to hire a DVM. if they are dragging their ass and not being respectful of your time as an applicant, look elsewhere.I 100% agree with everything you put into here, but I think it’s worth mentioning that all of these bad behaviors can happen with ANY workplace. Some of the worst non-competes and contracts are in academic hospitals. These are all very important things for everyone to watch out for no matter where they’re looking! I think some new grads are so focused on choosing a private practice that they overlook a lot of the things you listed out here too.And I agree with you totally. I worked in management with VCA (after my private practice became vca) and it was ugly shit. Not everyone is honest!!!Also. Be wary of massive sign on bonuses or high starting pay; really look into what they’re having you sign in a contract bc you may get stuck somewhere shitty because they reeled you in with a nice number.If you hate the idea of “corporate”, I encourage you to look further than the big names. VCA, banfield, NVA, MVP, SVP, and vetco (petco brand) all have not great reputations at the corporate and practice level. There are a lot of groups out there that can offer better pay and benefits because of a corporate partner without turning you into a cookie cutter drone. Look into petfolk, heartland veterinary, blue river pet care, western veterinary, modern animal, alliance animal, maybe Amerivet or vetcor but I don’t know as much about them.Sounds like a pretty decent deal!This is an excellent explanation!Banfield will rope you into a strict contract… I know the money is amazing compared to other places, but you will definitely understand why the price tag is so high once you get in there. Banfield is considered one of the most cookie cutter “true corporate” chains you can work for. Not a lot of autonomy.LMAO I love the udder comment… wow. And if their name is Joe, I think it’s fuckin joe… to be fair tho, I have met so many new grads who have no idea how to talk to or connect with clients. Building trust takes work, and trust leads to better relationships with clients who are willing to listen to your advice and take your recommendations. I see what they’re trying to do here. Also the one about “everything your dog puts in their mouth in a day” is something similar to what we would teach new grads; some clients are stupid and if you ask them what their pets diet is they will absolutely leave out things that may be important. Sure they get a can of wet twice a day but they “forget” to mention they also give the cat sugary coffee creamer in a bowl as a “treat” and wonder why it’s having diarrhea.I once asked a client to walk me through everything the dog ate in a day. Previous notes only mentioned dry food and biscuit treats. This lady was giving the dog chicken tenders with ketchup, cereal, raw eggs, raw chicken. I was like …..okay glad I asked lmaoBandanas with your logo are always cute! Also recommendations for local emergency services, the ASPCA poison hotline info. Free samples are always a good time, you can connect with your supplier reps to see what they can offer.As someone who hires doctors… they may not be exaggerating! So many practices have 2-4 vacancies they want to fill. Not everyone has the time or bandwidth to hire and mentor a new grad tho, so I would be wary of offers from practices that only have 1 doctor full time if you want a lot of mentorship or assistance. Sometimes the money and perks are amazing, but you will get thrown in the deep end almost immediately.I think taking a break for a few months is a good idea. You could do like 3-4 relief shifts a month at a shelter or something to keep your skills sharp and regroup later. But I do think euthanasia services as a new grad is rough. Not every case is just “ok we’re ready to euthanize”, there are still a fair amount of hospice cases and understanding disease processes, plus needing confidence with owners and doing everything in front of them. And, if you do go that route anyway and then want to get out of it and do something else, it would be a really tough transition. There’s a reason it’s more of an end of career choice for most, or maybe doing it part time along with a regular clinical job.Get a working interview. Some locations are great, but others are new grads leading new grads and the lack of experience shows. Ask about employee turnover. And scrutinize a contract carefully!I worked for VCA in management and they are horrible. Lots of “behind closed doors” icky stuff. I am at the corporate level of another company now that I prefer 10000%, we do hands off in our clinics but still offer programs for new grads as well as established. Mentorship though is more per clinic, we offer support but it’s personalized per location. Other companies that I hear good things about: heartland, vetcor, petfolk. I hear nasty things about Mission (MVP), southern (SVP), banfield, vca, nva. Goodvets seems to be 50/50, really depends on the owning doctors per location.the group I work for owns three different end of life practices, and we really don’t hire new grads for them. I feel that’s mostly because when you are constantly dealing with grieving families, they want doctors with a decent amount of experience in the field; you also have to have decent knowledge on most disease processes, chemo, and so on. Most general practices already have that component of patient management anyway, so you’d probably start off there and work your way into it?Also, cost of living has increased so fast, and the slow progress of higher pay for the vet industry is not going so quickly.I don’t mean to sound rude, but if that’s the salaries you’re seeing then that’s what they’re offering. Negotiation is ALWAYS on the table, some places are more willing than others to meet your expectations. It depends on the local clientele demographic, average invoice, cost of services, and potentially competition from other practices. I would look everywhere; indeed, AVMA, LinkedIn, handshake, etc. to see what else is being advertised. Keep in mind too that salaries listed on job ads are often a base salary with option for production, which you would have to determine per practice (based on the factors I just mentioned) as well as what you can bring to the table. If you get trained in AUS and can bring in those appointments weekly, you generate revenue and become more valuable.I feel you 100%. I have to imagine if they’re offering low bases then there must be other factors that aren’t clear; it’s worth it if you find a practice you’re really interested, to talk to them and find out if there’s a production component or other monetary benefits like a sign on or relocation bonusI think the often generalized comparison of DVMs to human doctors is the Achilles heel of the pay argument. Comparing two completely different ecosystems of industry continues to harm the mindset of new DVMs entering vet med. Yes, DVMs go through a lot of school, graduate with a ton of debt, and they are considered medical professionals. But the human med industry, even the human dental industry, is so deeply intertwined with insurance companies that we forget how much more it’s supported in the world. Human medicine is seen as a pure requirement; almost every single person, at some point, will require a doctors care. Because animals are still property in the eyes of the law, and because there is no sound structure of insurance to support extensive costs, people do not view it the same way. If you want to make a mid 6 figure salary, you have to put in work as if you own a business. You have to build a client base, and then you need to build trust with those clients in order to bring in a profit. I’m not saying I think it’s right or fair that vets are not paid higher, but it’s deeply seeded in the industry and it will continue to take a long time to fix across the board. The advancements made so far are a great start, but it may never be high enough in some parts of the country because of the demographics.You need to walk away from this place asap. Take some time to rest and reset. There are shitty practices and shitty managers; shitty doctors too. But there are so many options out there with clinics that are supportive, healthy, and fulfilling. Don’t give up just because this place fucked up.I help hire veterinarians for my company; I would ask both jobs if they can provide some benchmarking for their average doctor production in a year. You can definitely expect to bring in less than an established associate; but, in practices with good business and a full schedule, you could very well make decent money on a pro Sal model. There is definitely more stress with a production basis. Consider how much you will be able to bring in regarding surgery, dentistry, or in depth work ups; those are the money making appointments. If you have minimal extra skill or no drive to do so right now, I would start on just salary and just get some good mentorship and guidance while you start.I think money should always be a massive player in a choice like that! Beyond money, looking at the faculty and programs at each school, especially if you’re interesting in something specific.It sounds like a mix of anxiety and imposter syndrome. Investing in your mental health is incredibly important; talking to a therapist regularly can help you unload a lot of that negative energy or at least help you work through things. There are always going to be growing pains! If you work for a corp practice, ask management if there are options for new grads to connect from other practices. Building a network of people in a similar phase of your career can be extremely helpful in alleviating a lot of that stress. You can do this!Definitely a smart move to leave this practice. I’m sorry this was your first post grad experience. I promise there are better, healthier practices out there! And everyone is hiring!What school did you attend?I have not done the programs but as someone who works for a corporate vet company I would pay close attention to the contracts you sign with either. Requirements on length of employment after the program, noncompetes, etc… do all blue pearl locations have specialty groups attached? I feel like if they do it would offer more long term development by being able to work closely with doctors boarded in other specialties. VEG is truly just an emergency room, and at least at the location near me they often send extreme or very complex cases to other specialty hospitals like blue pearl or medvet where they have specialist groups working there. Not sure how blue pearl compares in that sense at every location.I hear this all the time about the Chicago locations… my DVM friend, who practices GP, refuses to take her dog to VEG in an emergency bc she doesn’t trust them at allIt’s definitely not common if they are not a boarded surgeon lol. But I think the current market will let most DVMs do what they want. If there’s a need for it, and they’re generating revenue, I would probably allow it within reason.Is your practice privately owned, or owned by a company? If it’s private, I would bet that this problem will continue and nothing will change. If it’s corporate, bring up the phrase “hostile work environment” and ask for contacts in HR. That will scare them and make them at least do SOMETHING real quick. And also, document everything. Write it all down. You need to have things to back up your side. I’ve seen this type of situation go several ways; the tech could be deemed a “more valuable” employee and you are fired as a “bad fit” and the bully wins. In general, try to get things documented however you can. I’ve seen wrongful termination lawsuits about stuff like this too.Ugh I’m sorry. You can go to management and still try the hostile work environment bit. I would still document everything you can. And the uncomfortable option is to ask the bully to have a mediated conversation with yourself and the manager, or just ask them to talk and be honest. Any direction you take could potentially end not well if I’m being honest.Yeah totallyWe had cameras in the practice I worked at, pretty much everywhere EXCEPT the exam rooms. And honestly I wish they had been in there too. Clients can be nasty behind closed doors, and doctors and support staff can also stretch the truth about how a conversation went or whether or not they actually went over prices, or gave a recommendation. I think it sounds like your manager is utilizing it for micromanaging purposes rather than promoting more open training and support. And, depending on the states laws, the clients may have to be notified or sign a release that they are being filmed. Might want to look into that.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

I completely understand what it takes to do both a PHD and a DVM and am committing to doing that. I am just asking for opinions on this specific program. As far as I know, It is not possible to become a professor at a veterinary hospital without getting a DVM degree.For my career path, it will either be PHD in Ecology working in basic research, or a PHD (in something more clinical), and DVM working as a professor at a teaching hospital.

plz_res_me,"Yeah I might try reading the owner and seeing if theyll upkeep or not. Regardless of the “most correct” choice, another vet chiming in from purely based on a *cat* owner’s perspective with no context is very dumb lol (assuming no context)They also never stop talking

like smh I got appointments, why do you need to know what anesthetics I’m going to use, how they work, and what route they’re going in ur cat? I can tell you anything and it wouldnt make a difference to you??The “what are you using?” And route for curiosity is fair tbh, my bad I also never care when ppl ask that!

But the “how they work” in combination with it all..Im sure they know how they work already so at that point I feel like I’m being quizzed. Its just all in the context with the owner where it feels that way, not always I shouldve saidSometimes I wonder if its in my head that they judge but I also never rly get that judged-feeling from anyone else 🤷‍♂️Ex-wildlife here, we know a little about a lot of things basically lolI had zero animal experience and just called my closest clinic to see if they would let me shadow

I’m now 2 years out of vet school lol

Just askI applied to ross and davis. I wasnt the most confident for davis (3.2 overall GPA, but 3.9 in last 2 years science classes - I had a turnaround) and good GRE score. Instead I went to ross during an off season (jan) and it was fine

I shadowed a couple of months before I got incredibly bored and then went to wildlife rehab and then decided vet school would be cool to doDo you have any tips for abdominal surgeries, or even just an ovh? I’m 6’4” and I have basically midget sized tables and staff and I want to prevent neck pain in the future by sitting. Pretty easy for the simpler mass removals / neuters for example

But for spays I find myself having to stand up frequently to look around and stuffI always experimented early just to see what the most efficient methods are

Either way if you put the work in youll be fine (efficient work, no distractions or any other shit going on) 

I just wanted to maximize free time so I found something that worked for me but not a lot of ppl so I got to have fun (relatively speaking) and still do p wellGraduated 2 yrs ago, I just lived across the street for all 7 semesters

I volunteered for months at a vet clinic mopping, cleaning, stocking shelves before they finally started teaching me how to help with animal restraint, drawing up vaccines, etc. and then eventually shadowing surgeries and other procedures.

Mental health is extremely important and more and more everyday there are new resources to help you manage stress and obstacles that may come in this field. Or just life in general. I suggest you start now with either seeing someone or on your own exploring ways to develop proper coping mechanisms in order to face life head on instead of shying away from adversity.

To me, there’s nothing like seeing an animal that has a complete shit prognosis do a 180 and instead of just surviving, they get to continue LIVING and THRIVING.

Additional_Result_78,"In short, no, it’s not that bad

I’m one of the negative Nancy’s that doesn’t love my job - but I work with some veterinarians who absolutely love it. My mentor basically says we do the coolest job on the planet and everyday is amazing. She was part of the realization that I may have chosen wrong (whether that’s wrong clinic or field who knows) - she gets energized from difficult cases and loves every second. I work with several other vets who are toned down from that but still love what we do 🤷‍♀️ so many variables 

Working in a clinic you love now is huge. When I graduated and started working as a vet I realized all the (good and bad) things from my vet assistant days were still there, but now I was in charge about it. So if you like your clinic now I think that’s hugeI'm sorry you're feeling this way. I am also a 2023 grad and feeling similar, but for different reasons. I'm actually leaving to pursue a PhD - I was always torn between clinical and research anyway and less than a year into clinics I confirmed it. 

That said, I really like what people are saying about testing a different clinic. I am in a hot spot for vet med and I actually really like that - I can send things to ER when they are out of my wheelhouse, and when there's a surgery I haven't seen yet and don't feel comfortable doing, we have plenty of surgeons in our network who would be fine with it. I've heard stories from my friend who came from rural practice about the kinds of things he had to do (ER-adjacent) because they were the only clinic around for several hours.. 

I've also read that the first year out is the hardest thing you'll do. So if there's any chance you do want to stick with it, I'd find a clinic with better mentorship.Hi! I’m in San Diego, 2023 grad at $140k, pro-sal 19% production. Personally I find it really hard to reach production, which is good/fine for now but I guess just to warn you. New grads tend to be slower, see less, do less surgeries, etc. so I guess I’d wonder how frequently they look at stats in terms of getting a raise. Noncompetes aren’t enforceable in CA I’ve been told. 
CE sounds appropriate, I’d ask for more PTO but also 120 isn’t bad for a first job, just concerning that that is also sick time. 
Signing bonus - mine was massive which was nice in terms of not living paycheck to paycheck (for once) but I’m considering leaving a year early and giving 1/2 of it back is a bummer so I like their 6mo scheme. 
Overall a solid offer, coming from someone in a similarly-high cost of living location. I would make sure you have good mentorship at your clinic and find out if you’re ever expected to be solo and how long before they put you in those situations.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

If it’s what you want, you can make it work. There will be a lot of sacrifices and it’s going to be bloody hard sometimes but for me at least it’s worth it.I’m really sorry this has been your experience 🤍
I wholeheartedly believe where you work and who you work with determines whether you enjoy a job or not, no matter what it is. 
I promise there are clinics out there that will make you feel supported and help you grow at a pace that makes you feel challenged but safe. You’re not a bad vet, you’re just still learning. The only way you could be a bad vet was if you didn’t care and it’s obvious that you do care. 
That being said, there’s absolutely nothing wrong in stepping away from it. Even for a little while to help get over your burnouts and to see what else the world has to offer. 
I know a few people who have gone on to work in government jobs. Even if none are being directly advertised, reach out to people you know who may have contacts that may have a job available. 
All the best, and look after yourself first and foremost.Both of these fields are not the sort of thing you go into because you feel like you “should”. They’re too hard and demanding. There was no way I could’ve gotten through vet school had I not loved it and known I would love the profession and be able to stay in it for the long run. 
We spend far too many hours of our lives at work to do something that doesn’t fulfil us and inspire us to be better. 
Financial pressures are a huge influence but you can make good money as a vet as well. There is no point becoming a doctor and then hating it and not staying in the field. 
If it’s what you’ve always wanted and you have a realistic understanding of what the profession involves, then I promise you, it is worth it.That’s quite a wide range! Thank you ☺️Would you cop less for a more supportive clinic though?

Southern_vial,"Fellow european here. I would guess it greatly depends also on what country you're studying in. I'm doing a bit of research myself, and in places like Italy the cost of tuition and bills would still be very low compared to US. I glanced at some vet med curricula and it looks like except for practical courses you don't have to attend the classes to take the exams. Additionally I know a lot of universities in Italy offer the possibility of pursuing a degree as a part-time student; it takes longer than the usual time-span, but it gives you time to still have a job and sustain yourself financially.

HopefulTangerine21,"Agreed, this is a very toxic environment. I'd find a new place to work. Experienced techs are supposed to be there to help and support new doctors, not tear them down. 

Over the course of my career as a tech, I've found that bad doctors are bad doctors, regardless of how long they've been practicing. I've worked with a lot of new grads who were better doctors than the 10-yr experienced vet. Being careful, and thorough, is expected from new grads, and your techs are supposed to be there to help things run efficiently and be a sounding board if you need it. So this sounds like a clinic culture issue, and leaving is really the only way for you to have a good outcome. I would be very forthcoming about the reason why you're leaving, so the PM can hopefully get things fixed for the next new grad, but trying to get those changes in place while you're working there typically backfires, because the techs will blame you and things will just get worse (been there, lived that, and left the practice for a better one.)","Veterinarian.

nancylyn,"Your license would in no way be impacted unless the practice is reporting you for theft of controlled substances. Is that what is happening? 

If you reported them to the DEA they will be investigated. 

If you want to sue them you could give it a try because “at will” doesn’t really apply here since they are retaliating against you for whistleblowing. 

It might be worth talking to an employment lawyer. Otherwise just move on and be happy you aren’t involved in whatever illegal stuff with the controlled substances is happening.What’s your plan for ascertaining a client’s “income bracket”? And no PIMS is going to have a built in way to categorize that…..you’ll have to come up with a tagging system that you use after you’ve run whatever financial check you plan on using. The cloud based PIMS my hospital uses is VetSpire. We like it a lot. 

Are you planning on using per diem staff exclusively? How will you insure continuity of care? Will you be in charge of all supply ordering and maintenance of equipment and quality control? 

I think your rates are low but it does really depend on where you are located and what the local pay scale is.Are you actively looking for a new position? 

I don’t know why you would give up all your training because of one shitty job. Find a new job. Take some time off if you can. But veterinarians are in high demand. Move on.It’s a medical profession. You can’t avoid seeing blood and injuries. Possibly way down the line you can choose a specialty that doesn’t do injuries (dermatology possibly) but there is a lot of vet work that will be done before then in which you would have to see everything. By the time you got so far as a specialty you would not care about blood anymore. 

Plus seeing blood is so common you’ll get desensitized in a short period. And….haha…there are way grosser things than blood and injuries.We don’t charge a reissue fee. That’s gouging as far as I’m concerned. But we would just email the vaccine record and not send any kind of hard copy. I suppose if we had to do that I’d have some minor fee to cover the time it took to make the thing out and mail it.Do they actually make a new handwritten copy? That’s seems excessive. Why not just email a document with the vaccines on it?So if it is only being made once and the scan is getting emailed what are you charging $16 for?My last job search I used Indeed. Some places Craigslist is also a possibility.Depends entirely on the hospital. I’ve been in places where the front and back do NOT cross over and in places where they do. 

Also…you can only be cross trained to be a Vet Assistant. Veterinary Technician requires going to school and getting licensed. 

If you are interviewing make sure you ask about cross training and find out what their process is. They should be able to tell you in detail how they train new staff (shadowing, buddying, using training checklist) If they can’t tell you how they train be very wary as it may mean that they do the “sink or swim” method which is a red flag. This goes for both being trained as a CSR and being cross trained.So….I’m just going to throw it out there that everywhere I’ve ever worked had gotten payment in advance before euthanasia….this isn’t insensitive it allows the family to leave whenever they want after the euth without having to deal with payment when they are grieving. 

As far as the callouts…..that’s a sign of an unhappy staff. It’s true that management needs to take action but not by punishing people but by finding out why they are unhappy and actively working to fix the systemic problems. This is a management problem. 

It’s up to you if you move on….you have to weigh the pros and cons.If this vet is the Medical Director then they are the one who is supposed to be setting hospital policy. You and whatever other upper managers you have need to have meetings where you all decide on policy. 
Do you have leadership meetings? 
If not I’d suggest that first thing. Then come armed with a list of issues about who the staff directly reports to….how policies are disseminated to the staff so that everyone knows what to do in a given situation, and workflow issues like the medication situation.Every client who comes through our ER says the same thing “my regular vet is booked three weeks out”.They do make safety glasses for taking x-raysIDEXX absolutely. The Zoetis machines and connectivity are janky AF. Nothing but a big headache.This is not the technicians fault….the dog isn’t being cared for by them. I have no idea why the techs are being brought into this discussion at all. If OP is feeling low confidence that’s not the techs fault either.For sure. I missed the part where it was one of the techs dogs. It’s definitely an owner compliance issue.Depends on the hospital. We have a lot of veterinarians in my hospital. Some love surgery, some hate it. Some love doing appointments or seeing ER’s. We try to schedule them predominately in the area that makes them happiest with the understanding that they will occasionally pull a shift doing appointments or a surgery day depending on staffing. Also we take into account that some vets are shit at surgery and will not be able to keep up with the surgery schedule so we don’t torture everyone by giving them surgery days. Same with the ER service. 
Anyway it depends on how big your hospital is. If the place can’t support having a vet that only cuts then the PM just needs to be honest with that vet and say it’s not going to happen. Probably they need to move to a bigger practice with a surgery service.Working on improving your GPA is critical. Start by retaking any of the science classes you didn’t get A’s in. Working in vet med does not make up for lackluster grades. Vet school is extremely competitive.I suppose….we don’t know what OP has taken so regardless of how they do it they need to bring up their GPA. They shouldn’t take classes they don’t need…so checking the prerequisites for the schools they are interested in would be helpful.Too bad it’s not a useful subject.It’s not lack of interest. Dogs and cats should not be fed vegan diets. Veganism is a choice Humans can make for themselves. They should not be forcing veganism on their pets. Cats especially.Yes, we were completely paperless with cornerstone. She’s paid for a PIMS that she isn’t using.We always have another person check that it is the right medication and milligrams. This is hospital policy and prevents mistakes. I’ve caught several mistakes from coworkers who were rushing and pulled the wrong bottle off the shelf. Nothing to be embarrassed about. We all have to hate each other’s backs.Lololol my god, I promise it wasn’t my subconscious writing.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment contains a mix of medical and veterinary related discussions, making it difficult to determine the profession of the author with",Medical Doctor

GuineaPigmalion,"I want to add a client perspective. 

It’s important that the title usage is consistent across the team to avoid confusion on the client’s end. 

Let’s say I go into the clinic with my hamster and the tech calls someone “Dr. Smith” but doesn’t call OP “Dr. Jones” and just calls her “Linda.”

I’m going to be confused about who the vets are, versus who the techs are, and as to who I should be talking to about which topics. 

I know uniforms may vary, but if I’m a client that doesn’t know what the uniforms mean, again, this inconsistency would leave me confused as to who was who. 

A confused client is a client that’s going to forget about the key information given by the vet, or who is going to forget about 

And…from a client perspective…

If somebody does notice the power dynamic play going on, and the inconsistent usage of language, it makes the entire practice look messy and unprofessional.

step1step2profit,"For cardio, the best path is probably to do an academic internship at a place with a well known rotating internship and cardiology program. I haven't been in the match for awhile, but it seems like interns from CSU, Tufts, Ohio, TAMU, NC State, and some others were the most likely to match their general rotating interns to a residency. So I can't answer your question about externship vs research program directly; go for whichever one is most likely to get you in a top academic internship.

That being said, while it's great to know that you want to do cardiology so early in your career, make sure to have an open mind going into the rotating internship. Your impression of a specialty will likely change once you step into your role as a clinician. It's also important to first be a good clinician in all aspects, not just cardiology.

Poo_Poo_Palms,"So because the animal world if quite unregulated, at least in the US, there is really no such thing as an animal behaviorist or cat behaviorist from a legal standpoint. The term behaviorist is unregulated, so anyone can call themselves a cat/dog/animal behaviorist regardless of their credentials.

The only regulated term is ***veterinary behaviorist.*** They are veterinarian who have completed a three year residency in behavior. They are the clinical experts of animal behavior. I would say among the veterinarian, these are considered the true ""behaviorists"", outside of the non-clinical research/PhD realm.

The legitimacy of the credentials for *other* ""behaviorists"" is completely up to the consumer of their services. None require state licenses, licensing examinations, continuing education (legally), etc. There are some more respected societies, such as American Veterinary Society Of Animal Behavior (AVSAB), that recognize some credentials as more legitimate than others, but again this isn't legally regulated.

There is nothing stopping me from starting a website called [animalbehaviortraining.com](https://animalbehaviortraining.com), uploading some lectures and quizzes, providing a certificate for feline behavior mastery (CFBM) and stopping you from putting CFBM after your name. Honestly, Animal Behavior Institute looks exactly like an example of this.

I'm sure there are plenty of self-proclaimed behaviorists in the world, with the alphabet soup of credentials after their names, making plenty of money consulting pet owners about their pet's behaviors. How legitimate these services are or valid the advice they are giving? Who knows.Hey - I'm a current resident at a large academic institution and went to Penn for my internship. 

It totally depends on the program. Some programs interview and not receiving an invite seems to be a pretty good tell that they aren't interested - like Florida, Colorado, Wisconsin. I've heard of a few programs that will interview some people but will be radio silent for others that still get in - the main one being NC state. Other programs are radio silent for everyone.I'd imagine so, unless they swapped to no or few interviews this year. 

I wouldn't have that influence your rank list though. If, for example, Florida is your ideal internship, I would still rank it as 1. It may also be possible that they only interview their top 20 but still have 50 people ranked.","Veterinarian.

In my opinion the pro sal model benefits the owner much more than the associate.Why not just go into GP so you can actually earn some money using all that knowledge you just acquiredI did about 750K my first yearThis is mostly true, but there are some exceptions. I started practicing in an extremely rural area with not nearly enough vets and produced much higher than classmates in cities/suburbs my first year or 2.

Wonderful_Tour_1319,"I don’t have anything helpful to say for your situation other than great work. I’m currently in vet school and I can’t imagine running 2 clinics solo shortly after graduation. You should be really proud of yourself, be grateful that the what sounds like cruel sink or swim style accelerated your learning, and find somewhere else. Your mental health is 100 percent the most important thing.The administration of the school is absolutely garbage. The sooner you accept that the less frustrating your time here will be. Fabulous lecturers. (Current vet student)I’m in the 4 year program so it is somewhat accelerated and I can’t speak to the 5 year. Having said that I think my program is very doable. I do have a background in animal science so that helps, but I think if you engage with the content and are keen in your studies you’ll have no troubles whatsoever. There are students in my program who work part time, and the actually time commitment of classes is really quite limited for us. Again I can’t really speak for the 5 year but given that it’s not accelerated I doubt you wouldn’t be able to work PT.","Other.

Wild_Sea9484,"I'm sorry but calling the ER is a courtesy not a right. And if you're gonna keep me on hold for more than 15 minutes you're loosing the courtesy. 


Additionally, has anyone seen the ER care decrease tremendously in the last years? Just transfered a case to Blue Pearl for a clear obstruction that I did not have time to cut myself, xrays and all. And they send it home with Cerenia. Came back couple of days later to resect some bowel. No we're not intimidated, but it's the hold times that kill us. It takes less than 5 minutes to to refer a case, you just have to come to the phone.


We can do what you do, we just don't have the equipment or the staff and we're on a schedule. I can't deal with a DKA in a 30 minute slot and I don't have regular insulin or overnight care. 


What really grinds my gears is when ER vets talk down to me as if we're ignorant and don't understand appropriate medicine. I'm with you. That was my thought at first too. Then I saw the discharge report on their portal.


Not the first time. My colleague saw an old dog with an untreated umbilical hernia that recently got bigger and seemed to have intestines in; confirmed on AUS, dog was painful, etc.  We again sent it for sx and it got kicked back. 


O was very motivated and understood the outrageous cost that they're charging now. I mean 7k for a hernia repair and if hospitalization is needed 3k more? Come on. 


Might just be my own local Blue Pearl. When I was in school the ERs arround there were excellent. I'm with you on that, if you can stabilize you should. You win some you lose some. Keep it up. You're doing great. Don't let a bad comment define you. WELL....depends how well you're doing. If you feel very confident in your spays, then don't come in. If you don't....then yeah. You should come in. Mentorship is a two way street. He doesn't make production in your cases so why would he go out of his way to teach you? This isn't school anymore. You need to have mentorship as part of your compensation package, ideally written out in contract, if you want to have a dedicated day where a more experienced vet will teach you. That way HE is also compensated for his time. 

&#x200B;

That being said. Don't worry too much. Few people stay at their first job.Yeah this seems like a hospital issue. Also ""ovarian remnants""? Really? I think your college should take some serious CE. Lyme I could understand, but how do you miss IMHA? 


With so many jobs available just go find one that values you. Very few people stay at their first job. Jesus that's low. In a busy practice? That's less than working at petco or shotvet. Are you the owner or have a stake in the company?I agree with you. I'm a vet. Base is 150k with bonuses I make around 200k. Cost of living in my area is lower. I'm not a specialist, in fact I graduated about 3 years ago. I work 38 to 40 hours a week (including 1 hour lunch breaks) and I usually leave on the dot or rarely 30 minutes after closing (for notes). It's a pretty good gig. Also at least right now there is tremendous job security. I have 20 offers in my inbox of places that would love to take me. I have an awesome mentor and I actually work corporate. I don't understand why people complaint. There is NO shortage of jobs. If you don't like your situation just advocate for yourself or switch jobs.DId you specialize? otherwise I see no reason why you would do 2 internships let alone one. Also your loans are SUPER high. Average is 250k for 4 years NOW.I agree with you. I don't know what we're complaining about. This is like the golden age of veterinary medicine. Salaries have never been as good as they are now.Haha I'm sorry. and this makes more sense. Surgery is tough, you must not like sleep or any semblance of a normal life. I almost went IMED but decided against is for QOL. I'm hoping you make 1/2 mill starting out so it balances.

Is-thisthing-on,"Current UCD 4th year here! I had the pleasure of tracking livestock and being able to work closely with Dr. Chigerwe as a student technician in C barn as well as over my third and fourth year and feel the need to speak up for a very well respected colleague and mentor. Dr C has worked as a mentor to students throughout their 4years of vet school, beginning with orientation and taking on a mentor group each year as well as until recently working in a position where he worked specifically within the curriculum to ensure that students had adequate work life balance and places to report learning climate incidents to ensure that students felt heard and safe as they learned. Working with students on clinics, Dr. C has advocated the most for students and residents to have time off of any clinician I have worked with. In fact, he called me personally the day after I stayed at the hospital until 4am working on an emergency to tell me to take an extra few hours off past the 6 we are typically allowed to ensure that I was well rested. As far as the long work hours, I don’t think it’s fair to say that this is something that he specifically is responsible for. UCD has one of, if not the, largest caseloads of any vet school in the country, particularly for livestock (which is something I would expect you to know as an alumni). The unfortunate reality of the Livestock Medicine and Surgery service is that they are three services in one. They must manage scheduled appointments, in-patients, surgeries, and emergencies with one team. This means that one weeks when it is extremely busy or when there are outside circumstances (such as a major wildfire), the service is incredibly busy and there is simply no one else to take cases or help manage inpatients. The school does their best to help with this by shuffling technicians to other services when they are swamped or having underclassmen or off duty clinicians volunteer their time when necessary to relieve the burden, but this is not a perfect solution. I absolutely agree with the post author that the overworking of residents and interns is a serious problem within this field, and remain hopeful that solutions can be proposed in the next few years. I do think it is unprofessional to single out a specific clinician as a villain in what is most best described as a systemic problem. I am very sorry that you had such a negative experience, but want to provide a different view of the person you have singled out here.For large animal, we still provide 8am and 8pm treatments. We are allowed to have 6hrs off of clinics after being on call if we are called in during the night, a policy that Chigerwes specifically advocated for. I agree that people do need to be held accountable in order to make things change, I just find it ironic that you singled out Dr. C when he has been one of the loudest voices advocating for students and residents. My only intention is to stick up for a mentor that has stuck up for me multiple times throughout my curriculum. There are many other clinicians I have worked with who are much more blasé about students and residents needs, and I think this is the mentality that needs to be changed. The balance between being a “go-getter” and someone who prioritizes work life balance is a hard road to find, especially in livestock medicine, and I do appreciate you opening up that conversation. I hope that UCD and many other vet schools pay attention to the national conversation around interns and residents in the future and figure out administrative ways to make sure that everyone gets the experience they want while also ensuring that they are mentally and physically rested!This will be my last reply as I think I’ve done what I originally intended (provide much needed context for non UCD individuals who might read this) and don’t see the point in going in circles with you when you’ve clearly made up your own mind. They have hired a new RVT every single year that I have been in vet school (since 2020), hire new student technicians every year, and have a treatment crew that comes to assist with AM and PM treatments each day (who are paid). They are opening up positions for interns in multiple services next year (who have very competitive salaries compared to other similar positions, you can check the match if you don’t believe me) to help distribute the on call schedule even more and reduce the burden on an individual. Granted, I don’t know how many of these changes are directly due to Dr. C, but he has been a vocal proponent of implementing them around the entire hospital and ensuring they are upheld, even as many other faculty grumbled about them. My experience with the person you’re implying is trying to deceive us all is making sure that students and residents eat, checking to make sure they got sleep, and even buying food for the entire service on busy days. He has been caring, checks in frequently with everyone, and takes his own cases without residents or interns if they already have too many in-patients (something no other LA faculty do that I’ve seen. And sure, 6hrs off is by no means perfect but it’s a hell of a lot better than nothing! It’s impossible to snap our fingers and fix things at any school, but I think that this is a great step in the right direction. I would also love to know if there are any veterinary students out there who can honestly say that they got 8hrs of sleep every night on every service at any school (I doubt it). I personally have never seen or heard of a medical error of the nature you described, and have to conclude that’s an extreme exception rather than your comment making it seem almost commonplace. It seems as if your experience was extremely different from my own, my classmates, and the classmates I overlapped with who have already graduated. I don’t think that publicly shaming someone who has already been making efforts to create change (and who was first author on that article for goodness sakes!) in a forum of peers is an appropriate way to create the change you say you want. I think your energy would be better used focusing on those that have made efforts AGAINST change (I can think of a few!). I also think you should reflect on the professionalism of posting your original comment at all, honestly. Again, I’m not trying to say that your experience wasn’t real, it probably was, but I believe that you are putting way too much blame on one person, and especially a person who has been actively taking steps to address the issues you bring up.

GhostxKitten,"Honestly, just patience and appreciation. It means alot to us when a client is understanding about the wait or other things that most clients get upset about. Of course treats are always nice, but the verbal appreciation is worth more imo.Thank you, that was very sweet. You are a wonderful person too <3Yeah, its not that you don't care. Its that you've seen it so much you learn to handle the emotions and keep going. I have so much respect for people who work in ER. I wouldn't be able to handle most things there. I am so thankful that there are people who do work in ER. You are making such a huge impact on the world.Thank you so much, your words mean alot. 

I know we're not supposed to ask ""what if"" but I couldn't stop thinking it over and wondering if the outcome would have been different. When the doctor started doing compressions, I knew it was over but I was thinking if the owner let us continue, could we have saved him? I don't think so, but I still wonder about it.Yeah, he was having symptoms since the night beforeI really just dont know what they expect. I dont think vet school teaches us how to do witchcraft.Jeez 😟I had someone not give meds because they thought their dog would become immune to them. 

Another person didnt give meds to their giardia positive puppy and complained that he wasn't getting better.Or when they think our doctor can tell what kind of ear infection the dog has with the naked eye. Yes my doctor has 8+ years of education but unfortunately they didnt learn how to use their eyes as microscopes.I work at Banfield which is owned by corperate. You can expect prioritization of quanity over quality. They cram as many pets in as possible because they have to meet certain numbers. Because of this, staff is overworked and overwhelmed.

pepitadefresaa,"I am currently finishing my first year of this career and I don’t like human medicine, I don’t love science either, but I am not doing bad, It definitely has easier classes than human medicine but others are just as hard judging by what my friends have told me.

It’s funny to me that people are saying it’s about ego, when it’s the opposite. It’s about imposter syndrome that I am currently in therapy for to overcome.Yes it’s not a typical internship for sure. It’s their own kind of mentorship program. Where i see very few patients and have long lunches but it’s just to get the ball rolling. 

The period of lower pay can be for as long as I want or as short as I want. It can be 1 month or one year but the mentorship rate will be ~85k annually for however long I choose, if that makes sense.
Once I end the “mentorship period” I will be switched to a pay of above 6 figures and I will have 30 min appointments.That’s why the pay is low initially.. to allow for me only seeing 1 hour appointments. And no it’s not B/S, I saw them do this with another young vet here. And yes it’s a 2 hour lunch daily. I know it sounds too good to be trueYeah this is how I feel…like im willing to be paid less and not hate my life as a new doctorNo it’s a small private clinicWhat’s bad about this internship compared to a rotating “real” one though? I’m still getting trained by DVMs, and they’re all GP so it’s exactly the cases I would be seeing. And I’m getting paid higher tooThey don’t pay based on productionI could easily find a splenic mass— I feel pretty confident in my US skills, rads are okkkk though 😅 but we have tools to help with rads. I see what you’re saying but I feel like it’s hard to lump all grads into one category bc the truth is every person has a diff level of experience. 
If residents weren’t treated so horribly I think more would venture into that realm but it’s become so awful these daysDoes VIN detail the diagnostics and steps to take for cases?Did you do anything to prep before you started the job or no? 
Also, how did you stay fresh with surgical skills?Is it wrong that I’m pissed that I’m at a clinic (I’ve known them for a long time) that is not paying me for my mentorship ? I’m working 12 hour days and not even getting a penny.. it feels wrong. And I’m 28 , a doctor, with no money to my name.This is amazing info, thank you!!!Wow good for you!!

Not sure why you’d assume I treat people poorly based on one wordWhat am I implying? Genuinely confused. I am a female and don’t find this word offensive in any wayThat’s actually the book series that made me want to be a vet haha. Read the whole series in 6th gradeWould you be open to saying which corporate did that?What makes it routine/boring?

I would love thatHave you ever worked with Banfield? I’m just curious bc I know Banfield has a pretty bad rep for giving wayyy too heavy of case loads. I really loved Banfield as a vet student but I am def super daunted to go there as an actual doctor.

How many surgeries do you do in a day? I’ve heard some crazy numbers like 80 per day…?What’s the low pay? I’ve seen google say it’s like 100k?? Idk if that’s accurate thoughSo there’s no room for growth either? Just stays 100k forever?Thanks for the info 🙏🏻One thing that really helped me is looking up consensus statements on google about various diseases. Know the diseases deeply, not just surface level. Understand the physiology behind diseases—this deeper understanding makes all the difference. This made me raise my score 100 points and I passed with ease.I would love to hear more about your experiences!!I have SEVERE anxiety and dissociation and I also debated asking for double time, as anxiety truly is a disability during tests. However, I ultimately decided to not do that (for my 2nd attempt) and I’m SO GLAD I didn’t!!! Two days of the test is even more stressful than one day imo. Go with your gut. My gut told me to not ask for more time and it paid off for me.I was 2 questions away from passing my first attempt and I literally wanted to drop out I was so depressed. Everyone around was celebrating—i lived with two girls who passed. It was living hell. My best advice is to not think about it at all. I started going on long runs and watching good movies. I didn’t retake it until after graduation when I was refreshed. Your mind can do crazy things telling you that you’ll never pass, what if what if what if. Think about your accomplishments of getting this far and trust that your story will be perfect in the end.MDs have 3 exams and a residency and vets have 1 exam and no residency required. That’s all I needed to know. Lol.Yeah it’s an unfortunate situation. I wish hazing didn’t exist but it is alive and well. I will not go to management bc I’d rather just suffer in silence than cause a confrontationI understand how it can be annoying to see someone you feel more experienced than, making more money than you. Quite honestly, most techs I know could easily be doctors if they had the means to. So I get it. It’s just a tough situation all around.Thanks for this thorough response! 
I absolutely agree that learning from seasoned techs is crucial, and I have been doing that (although it is tricky terrain bc while I want to learn as much as I can, it is also scary to be vulnerable and risk the techs thinking I don’t know anything…regardless, I have continued to ask questions). 
I’m sorry you lost a patient due to a dvm’s unwillingness to accept your help, that’s quite sad and unacceptable. 
I also tend to second guess myself but I always refer to the books and make sure what I’m saying is accurate. Honestly half the battle is just having confidence. I tend to know the answers but I doubt myself and people can feel that I’m sureI am definitely not assertive lol so yes agreedIt’s disappointing that other women are dealing with the same treatment. I am indeed a woman. Sorry for you too, being the support system to us vets is not easy.Haha well at least someone thinks that. We weren’t even recognized by Peloton as “real doctors” for a while lolTrue that. And 100% yeah being a PCP is difficult.

Yes, I won’t lie, it wasn’t an easy experience 😅 that boards exam was rough bc it covered everything and every species.Half are licensed half are not. Well you seem really kind.

throwawaybutter2023,"This depends on your goals (which you do not have to decide upon right away—focus on getting into vet school first!)

For starters, most zoos have exotics as part of their program (plenty of zoos have ferrets, rabbits, birds, etc which fall under the ‘exotics’ umbrella because they’re also common in the pet trade).  So if you’re a full time zoo vet, you will be seeing exotics.  But becoming a zoo vet is extremely competitive and difficult, and will require a lot of personal sacrifice.

There are also vets in private practice who see exotics.  Some even build up a client base so that they can almost exclusively see exotics.  Some of these vets will volunteer time and resources with small scale zoos who don’t have a full time vet, and that way they can get a small amount of zoo exposure.  Ultimately, zoo and exotics has a lot of crossover.Thank you for this!!! I did two internships because I was on the speciality path and burnt out.  I was essentially forced to not do a residency because I knew that I wouldn’t survive it with how abysmal my mental health was from my internships.  It is pure BS that universities who make millions a year cannot pay house officers more, and the way house officers are treated is proof that the way these universities preach about “work life balance” and student wellbeing is pure lip service.Going off of your first point, from the university side I also saw so many specialists leave (either to leave the profession entirely or for private practice).  I experienced the shutdown or near shutdown of multiple speciality services (including dermatology and neurology).  Not only was this concerning from a lack of teaching resources and patient care, it was frankly insulting and traumatic to residents.  I knew multiple residents who, after working their asses off to get to that residency, were forced to watch their programs dissolve and have to move to a different state to be patched in to some other universities residency.  This was also devastating to interns who were interested in that speciality and suddenly no longer had that service or letter of reference available.  I think this profession is actively destroying its specialists and I fully agree—we won’t have enough specialists in the near future.Another intern quit during my second internship and the overall tone about their quitting was very negative and that they were basically “too weak to cut it.”  I agree, these systems shut you down from being able to speak out.I’ll also add that even becoming a specialist isn’t a guarantee of significant wage increase, especially if you’re on the university side.  Many specialists in academia are making less than what most GPs are making.  This is driving a lot of specialists out of education (and for many, out of the field entirely).  I’ve also talked to financial planners who say that you don’t truly financially recover from the 4-5+ years of lost potential revenue while doing internship and residency, even if you become a specialist with higher wages compared to GPs.  You simply cannot make up for that many years of abysmal pay when you could’ve been making six figures with your DVM.Just a small thing I found that’s helped some new(er) graduates I’ve worked with—are you at a clinic full time?  If so, do they have the means to subsidize the cost of radiology reviews for you?  I’ve worked at clinics that cover the cost of radiology reviews (often within the x ray cost) or at least partly offset it so you can get a radiologist opinion on most or all of the images you take.  I feel like that’s super helpful because you can still try interpretation on your own, get a radiologist’s final say, and often those services can offer consultation calls for more detailed discussion.Got very close to leaving three years out.  Did two internships followed by a year in GP.  Was horrifically burnt out and miserable, and on the verge of leaving vet med entirely, so I left to do relief with tentative plans to move to mobile euthanasia, lab animal, or anything else that offers decent pay without being a GP full time.  Had a few classmates who did similarly.  Unfortunately in my experience, leaving entirely is quite hard because it’s rare to match the salary you can attain with your doctorate.So far, very enjoyable!  I like making my own schedule and the pay is quite good.  However, you sacrifice benefits being covered for you such as health insurance (I was able to enroll in my partners), PLIT, disability, etc, so those can incur pretty high out-of-pocket costs.  You will also have to pay higher quarterly income taxes as an independent contractor.  And of course, no PTO—you’ll have to work extra to save accordingly if you want time off.  

I personally don’t like having to plan these things for myself or the idea of hiring someone to do it, so I am only doing relief until something full time plays out.  I know lots of folk who have been in relief for a long time and LOVE it, but it’s not free of downsides.  

And I’m wondering how you found a job in government!  I’ve been looking but haven’t found any leads—maybe I’m looking in the wrong places?Seconding the animal control point -- don't forget, as a vet you're a mandatory reporter in most states.  If you feel that the animal is suffering and is being deprived of appropriate medical care, it is within your rights to contact animal control.  I feel that this isn't necessary or applicable in the majority of cases, but it is always within your reach.I’m gonna lay it out honestly to you, OP, as I just left a hospital with extremely similar circumstances.  A hospital that is as far gone as yours will take a lot more than a new MD to turn around—my prior hospital took on an excellent new MD and despite all of her efforts, nothing changed.  This hospital has a deeply ingrained culture issue, and it’s not worth the sacrifice to your mental or physical health (or the risk to your license) to try to stick it through this circus.  Best choice I ever made was leaving and I would think about doing just that.I second this!!! Also Stoskopf’s fish medicine and if you are into invertebrates, Lewbart’s Invertebrate MedicineAgree with many of the comments below.  I was on the path to be a wildlife/zoo veterinarian, and ended up leaving that path because of the INCREDIBLE intensity of post graduate training and low pay involved.  Wildlife is one of the most competitive fields of vet med and you will not be paid well.  Also -- there are some things in wildlife that you might not find ethically doable.  Sometimes you need to cull wildlife for population control or infectious disease management.  Sometimes you will need care for wildlife that is being kept captive for research projects (which may include things like artificial insemination, inoculating those animals with disease, etc).  

Even in small animal medicine, there are ugly realities of cruelty and neglect that you will encounter on a regular basis -- and a legal system that isn't always the most caring or attentive regarding animal cruelty.  You will HAVE to learn about large animal and production medicine in veterinary school.  In my opinion, liking animals is not a good reason to become a vet.  No matter what field you're in, the majority of your job with be interacting with people and not animals.  And those people can often be difficult, noncompliant, unappreciative, and sometimes downright nasty.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment contains information from both medical doctors and veterinarians.

user191514251,"Thank you to everyone for your support, and for sharing your experiences, for those of you wondering, I am looking in to getting it published somewhere like AVMA or DVM360 so stay tuned for that. I will probably respond to a couple commenters individually, but I have to say that hearing your stories breaks my heart. I know that a lot of people, including myself have experienced a lot of trauma from this system, but it still shocks me what some of you are sharing. I hope this turns into some kind of tangible change for all of our sake.I am looking for anonymous testimonies to strengthen a case for change. I know so many of you have a story to tell. If you can, send me a testimony of what you have experienced. It can be as short as a few sentences, or as long as you would like it to be. It can have specific stories or just how you feel. Also include an anonymous name you would like to be referred to as. These stories are invaluable to me. Like I said in the letter, “it is much more difficult to ignore a tide of shared trauma than one individual letter,” and I think it is very clear that there IS a tide of shared trauma. You send me a message here on Reddit or send it to my email (user191514251@gmail.com). If any of you are not ready to share, I totally understand as well. We are all at a different point in this journey.I’m very sorry that your partner has to experience this. I am also sorry that you have to watch it. There are few things worse than watching someone you love be abused and not be able to do anything about it.Human medicine, from what I understand, only has to Match one time (not including fellowships, etc.). Their internship is more equivalent to the first year of a veterinarian residency. We do not have to same luxury in veterinary medicine, and you are correct, internship does not in any way guarantee residency.I am so glad that you had this experience, it is encouraging to know that good programs are out there! I think this shows the advantage of determining a fair system of checks and balances: the good programs will have to change little. Again, thank you for sharing!While I’m sure it would be helpful for many to have the names of those residency directors, I can guarantee you they are not the only ones doing this, which is crazy when you think about it. There is a dark underbelly to this abuse of power.Abuse, exploitation, and mistreatment are bad for the veterinary specialties, as you have outlined here. Many people avoid specializing to avoid abuse, justifiably so. A fair system would encourage better learning and would revive interest in specialization.The “too weak to cut it” narrative is one of the most common, and it functions to maintain abuse on multiple levels. It shames the person who is experiencing the abuse, either causing them to ignore their mental/physical/emotional/financial needs, or to quit their program and admit their ‘weakness.’ It also serves an example to all those witnessing that this is the culture.

I want to be clear, if you leave your program for your own well-being, you are not weak. It is a lie meant to keep people in place they do not want to be.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

I have absolutely used a version of that sentence to de-escalate phone conversations, but the way it's worded in your example does seem \*very\* condescending.

laserxop,"Speaking from a government vet perspective. 

Not only did I go through a similar thing (not feeling like I was cut out to do clinical work), I actually had a greater interest in Veterinary public health and pathology. You said it's mostly an ""office job"". Federal? State? Or are you outside the US? 
I, myself, took the official veterinarian route. 
I actually started off working for the government of NZ where not only did I carry out verification of sanitary procedures, was also in charge of handling animal welfare issues and conducted compliance visits at a number of farms. 
The work life balance was pretty sweet indeed. 
I did end up moving ""into an office"" eventually where I was dealing with animal imports and animal import products. It was mostly policy but, again, offered further work life balance. 

Fast forward to 2022 and I am State side working for the USDA as a Public Health Veterinarian. If this is the govt job you are talking about, it is certainly not an office job... haha. I guess it does depend on the location but I would say it does put your knowledge to test. Particularly pathology. 
I'm no longer in that role and, yeah, now I'm in a role that's a bit more removed from Veterinary medicine. One that still involves a lot of technical skills and whole lot of soft skills. Still, I view my current role as a stepping stone. There are definitely roles that do require clinical knowledge through APHIS as well. 

Not sure if you were one of those that dreamed of working in a veterinary clinic. That wasn't quite me. So I at least wanted to share some perspective on the government vet role. It may not be your thing, but there are definitely a lot of opportunities through government vet roles.

Spiritual-Flan-410,"I find that it is not unusual for seasoned techs to be a bit apprehensive about new docs.  This was how it was for me when I started ER 25 years ago.  I also learned to *listen* to my *seasoned* techs carefully.
9 times out of 10, they are correct.  

As a new doctor that never did any GP and went right into ER from day one, I can't tell you how invaluable those techs were to me.

Having said that, there are techs that think they know it all.  Those may or may not have years of experience under their belt.  
I was pretty good at figuring out those that *thought* they knew a lot from those that actually did know a lot.  The former? I would just give a bit of a nod too and then proceed to ignore their advice.  The latter?  I would seriously consider their input.

Personally, I ask all my techs and fellow docs to call me by first name.  Yeah...yeah... I know I *earned* the right to be called Doctor but it always feels hierarchical and I like my nurses to feel uninhibited about coming to me for anything.  Clients always call me doctor.

Having said that, if the protocol there is for the nurses to refer to doctors as ""doctor"" (or if that was your preference) and that one nurse was refusing to call you doctor, I would be having a discussion with the lead nurse about it; assuming I asked the offending nurse to call me doctor and it went nowhere.

Substantial-Humor-69,"In general, academic internships provide a more streamlined opportunity for research (if thats your thing) and generally have a higher match rate of interns into academic residencies without having to do a speciality internship first. This depends on the specialty of course and again, this is a generalizations. There are exceptions. Private v. academic can both be busy with long hours and high expectations, however my experience in academia has been that there is a large network of support as there are many other trainees (rotating interns, specialty interns, residents, fellows and even students) and because students are continuously rotating through the hospital and doctors hold faculty/teaching roles - they are more inclined to teach (yes, even interns).

For your school of interest - make sure they have a high case load, strong emergency department (you will spend a lot of time here) and enough faculty in your field of interest to mentor you and write letters.  Some really good schools are losing a lot of their faculty and many residencies are on probation as a result. 

Good luck!","Veterinarian or Medical Doctor. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian or Medical Doctor"" because it discusses academic internships",Veterinarian
Gold_Departure_9153,"\*Extremely Subjective opinion.\*

Honestly I started off with some mental health issues (depression, anxiety, severe lack of confidence/self doubt) that had basically been COMPLETELY stable for 5+ years. Vet school has completely reactivated them x1000, despite doing therapy and being on medication. I'm burnt out and despite passing boards and being near graduation, feel like this was a huge mistake and incompatible with my personality.

You can do vet school if you want. If I had to do it again, I would choose a different career. I would recommend this career to those who have had no to minimal mental health problems prior to vet school (bc most people will end up with them from how stressful this career is). 

Us mentally ill people can certainly do it, but there is a price to pay. The experience is harder because you are fighting more than just academic battles and fatigue. You can completely lose your self worth and identity if you are prone to these types of things.  Good luck and go with your heart.What you are experiencing is completely normal. I commend you for talking about it. I promise so many of your classmates and graduated veterinarians feel that way, some just talk about it more than others. Very few people leave veterinary school not feeling this way at some point or another.

This is a field where you may never feel ""good enough"" and you just have to try and accept that. This is more of an ""I tried my best and did what I could"" career. 

The shyness will get better with time, confidence, and knowledge base. Even if you are really shy, who cares. I have seen so many vets with horrible bedside manner (impatient, standoffish with client) and they are doing fine. Just advocate for your patient and have empathy for your clients and things will work out.

The forgetfulness happens to a large number of people, some more than others. If you have ADHD, anxiety, or aren't a super genius you may be more forgetful. I certainly don't remember things most days and have to look them up. \*\*The important thing is that you have resources to look things up, and when you truly don't know ask a colleague\*\*

No one can know it all. Unfortunately lives are in our hands so that feels anxiety provoking. Be kind to yourself. What you are experiencing is unpleasant, but normal (imposter syndrome).","Other.

RVT esp at your level and your ethics are in high demand. I expect you’ll have plenty of choices for your next employmentThis is wonderful. Wanting to know more. Knowing there is more to learn is what drives vets to become better vets and stay excited for decades.

Ask questions. You’re entering clinics so take what you’re seeing  home and see where it lines up with what you were taught. Inevitably there will be differences, nuances. Why did they run that test or how did they know they didn’t need to run this other test. What told them to test for this disease first.
Why did they choose that suture closure. Is there a reason they chose that antibiotic but no culture this time but they cultured the last time ( and pray they’ve got a good answer for you)

Take every exposure as a day to reaffirm what you’re learning and springboard from.

It’s hard, too, to have more experience than most there and have experience that might indicate you’ve figured out better ways to do things that what this clinic is doing.
I don’t know what your approach has been as a new comer or how long you’ve actually been in this clinic.
But a couple of thoughts:
Set aside your knowledge for now as you don’t have 3 years in THIS clinic. You’re there to blend in and support and have them figure out what a wonderful addition you are. So observe, ask more questions than give comments, and listen.

Unless you’re seeing something medically dangerous, illegal or contraindicated, go with their flow till you figure out if they NEED your years of experience in that particular way. Who knows you might learn something from them too.

You may need to give your superiors a heads up of the personal attacks continue about them desiring you getting fired and replaced by the one who left. You may not know the full culture of that clinic yet and whether there is 1 person out of line or a whole messed up system.

Stay in the middle. Be a flexible team member who’s there to help THEM and their clinic in the ways they need.

She's a notoriously difficult stick and the EMTs and several ER RNs were not successful in placing an IV, so they paged the IV Team and the waiting game commenced. After a bit her assigned nurse returns and I asked if she minded if I had a try after explaining my job and experience (in the hospitals where I worked I was frequently called upon for getting samples from difficult sticks). She says if my wife agrees then go ahead. A short moment later I had the line in place and stepped aside. The nurse smiles and said you just made my job easier. I made a zipping motion across my lips. No commotion, just felt it was an unnecessary slow down and wanted to keep things moving in my wife's evaluation.

When the bill is 3x the original estimate are clients upset and confused? There may be convos with the client happening you aren't privy to. Lots of old school vets like to hide pricing for some things but that's not the norm now.How much PTO do you end up taking? I've seen some clinics and other industries offer this but I've read some stuff about how people actually take less PTO because they don't see it accruing and management is able to exact more control. :/As someone who took exotics transfers from my local VEG, they have a ton of work to do to train their doctors in exotics medicine. They would do a BG and ALT and send the rabbit out the door with one dose of SQ fluids and 3 days of reglan for the rabbit who hasnt eaten in 3 days. These rabbits should be hospitalized! Or they would transfer to me after the patient had been hospitalized with inadequate treatments and it would be very sick or crashing when it finally got to me.

It is probably very hit or miss and I am sure some VEG docs probably do great with exotics but please, if you decide to work for VEG, take exotics seriously.

I can't speak for the distinctions of other countries.Honest question - what happens to the pets then? In the US it would probably end up in an overcrowded shelter where it or another pet gets put down anyway to make room. How does Germany handle this? What criteria do they use to decide euthanasia is justified?Euthanasia is not the hard part; the lack of euthanasia is imo. Euthanasia is peaceful and not a bad ending at all. The conditions pet owners force their pets to live in because they're unwilling to let them go or manage their needs correctly, however... that's the hard part. 

Also imo (less popular opinion) there's really no such thing as convenience euthanasia when we have such an overpopulation of pets problem. If a pet is otherwise healthy and could go to a new home, many owners are willing to surrender to a rescue if you offer to reach out for them. But when the alternative is going to an overcrowded shelter where them coming in means another animal getting pts, is that really saving anything? Idk. I come from the large animal rescue world where the lines for quality of life are drawn much differently and the barrier for entry for rescuing is much higher than small animals, but I wish the small animal communities would discuss euthanasia more practically than they often do.Interesting! I wish that worked here.Yeah that behavior is unacceptable. It would be one thing for them to be hesitant until you got more experience, but being openly disparaging is not okay. Vets are in far too short supply for them to be acting that way. Talk to your boss first, and if nothing improves I'm sure a better clinic would be happy to take youI would finish the program if you're close, but don't continue the career if you hate it. Take the degree and do something else with it. Having that degree will help you get other jobs or get into different programs. 

Just because you've put this much time in doesn't mean you have to keep putting time in.

 I was halfway through masters in biology for ecology research when covid hit and I got hella burnout with academia and research altogether. I dragged myself through the degree, then applied it differently and went into data analysis instead (and now applying it toward vet school lmao)It would only potentially stop you from getting the grades you need to get in, but won't likely affect you doing well in vet school.
You could also go the vet tech route if the clinical stuff is what you enjoy. Vets don't often get to do much of that.Shadow a clinic and find out if exposure helps. 
I personally grew up around farm medicine, so fluids and gore never got me, but I had to watch a handful of spay/neuters before I stopped flinching at the scalpel lol. 

Similarly, when I did my undergrad in biology, there would always be a few students who had to walk out of the first dissection lab for a bit, but by the end of the semester it was just another day 😅.

Most everyone ""gets over"" squeamishness pretty quickly but there can always be something that comes up that you're not used to. Just the other day a cat came in to the ER with an amputation incision popped open and its insides making their way to the outside - even the seasoned techs gagged at the one.Question about how clinic hours are verified by VMCAS:

I have taken a pretty curvy road to get where I'm applying to vet school this year, so I'm about 10 years post high school where I did about 100 hours of vet clinic shadowing between two small town mixed animal clinics. 

I've called both of them and they said they don't have records that far back for volunteer hours, and it's been almost 10 years so I'm sure the vets don't remember me personally after only a week of shadowing each (full days for a full week at each clinic) 

I'm wondering if I can even count hours from that long ago, and if so, how does the VMCAS  verify clinic hours? Would they call the vet for verification, or need something signed? I expect both would be willing to if I sent them my documentation from the original shadowing experience, I'm just not sure what to expect.

(Well, accepting interview offers right now!) I can discuss privately my candid views on the education here etc, and how that translated over to internships/nuances of that. (I had also interviewed and was accepted to CSU my first cycle, but declined due to financial cost) 

Background is I’ve been interested in ECC since before vet school and had always planned to intern since before I had applied to schools. (Not interested in a residency at this point, but yeah!)Yup! Feel free to.(I started veterinary school at 29 - applied two cycles. Did have strong GPA) I feel like something must be happening in her application that is resulting in her not being considered for interviews? As others have mentioned, some schools have an algorithm.. UC Davis is HIGHLY competitive, basically you need to hit a minimum GPA to be even considered holistically. During my interview year, they interviewed 240 - 40 of those applicants were more holistic, but you needed at least a 3.0 for this. 

Im currently at RVC.. can answer questions, not entirely sure about the full admissions process, but I did feel it was “easier” to get into than some other schools. Has she tried talking to any counsellors or admissions offices from the schools she’s interested in? That may provide her with more insight..

Lonely_Technology,"I worked at a large practice during a transition to digital and it sucked. I don't think there's any secret trick to it, it's just a lot of labor. With that being said here are some things we did to streamline the process:

1. Remove as many charts from the pool of charts that need to be scanned. Go through and take every chart for a patient you haven't seen in 3 years (or whatever your local law may stipulate) and immediately separate them and archive or store them. Same for deceased patients. 

2. You need to figure out a format and system for how you want to organize the digital files. We opted to go with a system where about 15-20 pages was chosen as the max. For 90% of patients, that was the entire paper record. For patients with denser files, we separated the chucks into years, and further into months for some patients with extensive histories. Make sure to establish naming and filing conventions. 

3. Hire a temp if you can. At it's core, this is a basic data entry job. See if a local temp agency can set you up with a short term or part time person to help with this work. 

4. Determine how to handle abnormal attachments and other odd stuff. Across the thousands of files I scanned, so many had staples, paperclips, tape, whatever. Common items were smaller x-ray films, lab request forms (like the old antech carbon copy ones), photos from urolith labs, even little envelopes with digital rads and ultrasound files on CDs. 

5. Separate the tasks of scanning the files and linking them. Scanning should be done in bulk, then linking in bulk. If you constantly scan and then immediately try to attach the files you'll never make a dent in the work. 

6. Start with the newest charts first and hopefully by the time you get around to the older stuff it may have aged out of the timeframe you're required to keep records. 


Also this may go without saying, but I would recommend keeping the physical charts (even just in offsite storage) for some amount of time. We ended up with a number of files that got corrupted, were lost, or otherwise had errors and we needed to go back to the physical chart.","Medical Doctor.

GoonTheDVM,"I put some stuff on my application that was from about 10 years prior and when I got accepted my supervisor from the volunteer work 10 years ago said that they were never contacted for verification so I'm not sure if VMCAS actually verifies the hours if they aren't really high or suspicious in some way. I think either way as long as you aren't lying you should put it on your application.I'm a current 1st year and I personally have an IPad and a MacBook and use the notability app for note taking and studying. There are other similar apps that are probably just as good I think people just prefer whichever one they get aquatinted to first. There's a couple people in my class with a surface and I know a couple of them switched to iPads and said they like them better but some still swear by the surface so I think it's honestly just up to the individual person. I do like the ability to easily text or airdrop documents or photos to my apple devises though.I am in my second semester of first year and we have about 23 hrs of in class lectures/labs. For an example of a day on Mondays we have lectures from 9:00-12:00 with a break and a lab from 1:00-3:00. Most days have a similar schedule other than Fridays which there is no lab and we are done at 12:00. Usually after the afternoon lab I will take a break and then study from ~5:00-8:00. Obviously it can vary a lot depending on the week but I'd say that's about the average for a normal week. I would recommend trying to look up schedules for schools you are interested in, not all of them make them easy to find but they are usually available somewhere on their website!Hey! So I'm not a math person either but I'm actually in my first year of vet school now and it hasn't posed a huge problem yet! I did have to drop calculus at my university and retake it at a community college. I also was very surprised that the statistics course I took was actually more reasoning than math. In vet school itself we have had very minimal math so far (simple addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division is about it). I think that if you really wanna do it you might have to put in some extra work but you shouldn't let being deficient in math stop you!Honestly it depends on the course, for our histology/physiology course it is just 5 exams each worth 100 points, but then for our clinical pathology class there's more so it has exam 1 (25%), exam 2 (25%), final (25%), lab exams (10%), and various other assignments (15%). So while some classes have other assignments the exams are generally still worth no less than 75% of your grade. But for most classes the final is usually worth the same amount as the other exams (there are exceptions to that too though).","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

There are some labs where you can do more intense surgeries, like what you would do in the case of a foreign body or even an amputation. A lot of the time this is on a cadaver depending on your school. Some schools still do terminal surgeries and others will do a few terminal surgeries on pigs.

As far as learning about surgery procedures, you learn of A LOT more than you preform while in school. Some you will almost always refer to a specialist others you might do in practice with mentorship or continuing education.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Covid did throw everyone for a loop and it does leave those grads at a slight disadvantage but only for a short period! Once you jump into a clinic and find your rhythm it's actually pretty fun and you'll be surprised how much you remember. Sure beats an office job if you ask me. But at the end of the day just have to go with what you love and know that you're never stuck, you've got so many options in this field. Good luck!Another vote for James Herriot! Makes me want to just move to the English countryside.I have definitely been in your shoes. I am a complete introvert and given the choice I would rather not socialize more than necessary. Having said that, I have also been practicing for 9 years now and really enjoy being a vet. I’m not going to say it is easy but it does get easier with time. Sometimes I think of it as being in “doctor mode” during work- sort of like acting like someone else if that makes sense? 

I have worked with many vets that have similar personalities traits that are amazing doctors and clients feel at ease with them, so you don’t have to be an extrovert to succeed! I would be happy to share more if you are interested! Good luck and don’t worry, you’ve got this!Any chance they could show you numbers from previous years? That might give you an idea of what to expect. Even better if they can give you an idea of what they are doing to advertise the new hospital etc. If you are invested in this, there are things that you could do personally as well. I have unfortunately been in a similar situation and did end up leaving because I could not meet production due to an empty schedule/high cancellation rates. I would be happy to chat more if you are interested. Good luck!I think it depends on what your goal for your career is. If you really enjoy surgery then a shelter job would definitely be a good fit. However if you want to improve on your medicine skills, a shelter job might not give you the exposure you need. A good GP would actually be able to help you with both and eventually make you a more well-rounded vet. Being willing to do surgery in a GP setting is a definite need these days… I find more and more recent grads not wanting to do surgery for various reasons, so that could work in your favor. 

It’s true that mentorship these days is not quite like what it used to be. If you would like to I would be happy to share more of my experiences. I’ve been in small animal GP for 9 years and have done relief work in lots of different types of clinics so definitely understand how important it is to find a place that matches your goals.

cystotomy,if you're horsey Bristol isn't the best place for you- though they have a decent relationship with the world horse welfare charity you could gain similar experience there or elsewhere regardless of the school you're at. the vet school at Bristol shut down their teaching equine hospital at some point in the past 3-4 years and I've heard (double check this) that they will be shutting their abattoir down or reducing the operating capacity which doesn't bode well for the future of their small stables (every riding school I've been to has been larger than their stables) and equine teaching facility. I'd really recommend Nottingham as they offer very affordable livery for students horses on the condition that they can be used to further teaching and a degree there will give you the same international accreditation as Bristol (and you get two degrees instead of one in the same duration)- living costs will also be a whole lot more affordable than at Bristol!bristols still a wonderful school I'm sure you'll have a great time!! they have what I think (just from what I've seen) is the biggest on site commercial dairy facility out of all the uk vet schools and will have a much larger number of mature and international students + they have the Langford referral hospital on site which'll be such good experience to have!!,"Veterinarian.

takingtheports,"Loved your words here, spot on. Also to say that the best thing to take from when this happens is to learn something from it that you can take forward for your other patients.In the UK there’s a charity called PDSA that provides vet care to people that qualify for universal credit (welfare system) which they prove by bringing a payslip because the payments will show up on that. The US won’t be as simple but some sort of benchmark or qualification can be used?The BVMS is equivalent to a DVM, if they ask for more info you can provide your state license or direct them for clarification from the state vet association.The job might have color requirements or simply give you already embroidered gear or a name tag with “dr name dvm” etc. I’d honestly wait until you started work. 

Most places have a budget for clothes etc to make folks cohesiveThey won’t be required to offer that salary to new entrants, they’ll just significantly reduce their pool of applicants. For current interns/residents, not sure how they’ll navigate that… 

My sneaking suspicion is that they’ll try and lobby to be on the exempt profession list but I’m no expert on UK law, just a general guess…You should ask about how they’ll give you training in appropriate triage of cases and language for highly emotional situations. That will be the biggest difference you would encounter going from a human ophthamology practice to veterinary practice.Any answers and advice will depend on where you graduated from. All of these countries have different exams and requirements before licensure depending on where you graduate. 

For information for the UK look at the RCVS website, for NZ and Australia look at their Veterinary Council websites, and for the US look at the AVMA website to read up on what you might be required to do.Where will you graduate from?Vet Prep is the name of the stepping stone semester for Ross (likely modelled after the system at Massey Uni). VetPrep is the study package for the NAVLEEvery day is a learning day as a veterinarian for sure. Although I found great use in the foundation of information, clinical skills, communication, legislation, etc learned during my veterinary coursework.I studied in the UK and it’s given me a wealth of opportunities to live and work abroad, but I did early entry so the cost was comparable to my IS. I never want to go back to work stateside though (sat the NAVLE though if I ever need to go back). If you want to practice stateside, LSU is probably your better bet simply because of cost. But if you want something different, the adventure, the exposure to somewhere different (and easy access to Europe for 4-5 yrs) then consider RVC. 

Also the age thing of classmates doesn’t impact anything about your experience in vet school, it’s quite balanced and you can be as involved as you want. I found it made the experience less competitive and petty tbh (in comparison to a stateside Animal Science/pre-vet program). We all just wanted to get through it and have fun along the way.For information: 

Students in a tier 4 visa in the UK pay a one off fee for access to the NHS (national health service) when they pay for their visa for the UK. 

Student visas do not contribute to years spent in the country for future permanent residency or citizenship.Do what you need to do to grow and learn in this career, you’re learning and should not feel like a bother. Best of luck fellow 2 yrs out grad!Studied in UK, can do both. Prefer flank for smaller animals (shelter work, younger kittens) but both are done where I work now, vet and procedure dependent (midline for pregnant/large/etc)ECFVG is a long process and you wouldn’t be able to complete it in the timeframe of a tourist visa. It is not legal to work on a tourist visa either so maintaining yourself would be difficult. 

Other countries do have exams for foreign graduates as well depending on the school they’ve graduated from (examples: RCVS for UK has a statutory exam, AUS/NZ have an exam as well)Would just like to add to your discussion point regarding industrial euth (or slaughter). In my experience being a vet in slaughter premises, the staff in charge of the main killing components (loading, stunning, cut/bleeding) show a tremendous amount of respect to animals and the work that has gone into rearing them and respecting the responsibility of providing quality food. Typically from having had a farming background of some kind. But i have at least found that they showed great attention to detail (cow positioning, machine functionality), calmness to reduce loading stress, and speed (to comply with the requirements of cutting and bleeding time) to make sure animals pass without awareness. Granted this was in a country with high welfare and legislative standards for slaughtering, but i don't think its worth brushing lack of disrespect onto all people that work with animals on the food production side/industry. (not discussing lab animal euth here of course, that can be a different emotional experience for some). I interpreted industrial as food production, so apologies if you meant something different. 

Seconded on the emotions in front of clients, especially when its been a long road or many visits, I have caught myself being emotional in front of clients and i have never ben seen negatively for doing so, although i ensure that those feelings do not get in the way of performing the euthanasia professionally and peacefully for the pet.I am not :) there are many other users of Reddit outside of America lol. But I have worked as a veterinarian in the US previously, so my experience/comments are often to add a broader perspective than just what happens in the US to veterinary threads. The US has a long way to go on a lot of legislation surrounding all aspects of animals, livestock, etc.Yes traveling in Europe is feasible on long weekends with cheap flights on Ryanair for example! Take advantage of countries being 2 hrs away, instead of 8-10hrs+

The new grad programs are all pretty standard in terms of offering CPD your first year, a theory for mentorship, etc but it is really up to the individual practice and the team around you to make your first years out supportive and meaningful. There are so many practices in these programs but it doesn’t make them all the same. For all of them though you’d have an interview with a corporate recruiter and then individually with practices based on your interests in work and location, that’s the time to get to know the staff you’d be directly working withI was in IVC new grad scheme but I had classmates in all of them that I heard bits about all of them. All of us generally started over £30k annual with sign in bonuses, CPD planned for two years, usual other job perks like RCVS registration paid, etc. 6.5 wks holiday, some form of private health coverage… 

They’re great for having a built in network of graduates in the exact same boat as you to make friends and relate to. 

Saw other comments related to work life balance. I found working in the UK much better than the US for that reason alone. (Have been in US, UK, and NZ to work, for context). And being in Europe is awesome (imo). Worth taking these years to learn and assess what your priorities are to make a location decision (time off, travel accessibility to places you want to see, safety, finances, culture, etc).I did relief milking shifts before classes and on weekends or pet sitting gigs (like rover). Other classmates work at grocery stores, bars, restaurants, etc on weekends usually or evening shifts. Most of my class didn’t have family help and were making loans and jobs work to make ends meet. Typically cut back in final year because clinic work hours made it hard but some people still did weekends shifts when the schedule allowedAnd that veterinary surgeon would either need to work for a practice or have all the appropriate paperwork and setup as their own practice to carry these sorts of medications in accordance to the controlled drugs regulations.

Even many rural practices offer home appointments and euthanasia to improve access to care and help owners avoid the longer journeys with pets prior to euthanasia in these areas.

Love and second everything in this comment, well written -spython-Some of these programs (for licensure after graduating) can also cost into 5 figures though? (I’ve not looked, more as anecdotal info)

Worth looking into and researching these as some take a while to complete even after you’ve graduated. There are fb groups of folks going through them that could shed some light on the processes for OPHad plenty of graduates in my year at a UK AVMA accredited school get into internships through the match without issue. 

The schools are well connected and have European/American diplomates in many specialties in their hospitals, you’d be as competitive as any applicant that studied in North America (plus if you want to network at a particular hospital, uk curriculums have long breaks to fit in externships, you could go to US\Canada for some of those).You’ve been studying for this not just on vetprep, but throughout your whole vet school education. There is nothing studying will add now, just more stress. 

Get a good meal, a good sleep, get your bag/items ready in the evening so you’re ready to go in the morning. Best of luck!Their one experience is also not for the whole of veterinary school. My school and class was generally very collaborative and supportive and we were not in lecture or labs all day because the uni wanted us to have time to work, study, have hobbies, etc. Yes vet school is undeniably hard but it’s built to teach proper generalists who can then specialise if they want, but MDs get more and more focused on one area as their training and studying goes on. Plus if vet school was any longer than it is, the debt would be even more significant than it already is for the salaries we get afterwards (as compared to established MDs)The thread on r/veterinaryschool had a lot of good discussion points on thisTo work in the UK they’d need to research what schools then can get RCVS workout during the RCVS statutory exam. Although it’s arguably less painful than the AVMA foreign graduate programs. The schools they’ve listed are UK schools that are AVMA accredited, but there’s more added to that list now in the UK if they want that option down the lineAs an addition to your well thought out comment,  I’ve seen cctv as helpful in cases of client abuse (verbal, and unfortunately a few physical cases) but never experienced it for mentoring purposes.Talk to your workplace about your aspirations and see if they have room for you to do VA shifts even you’re not doing kennel shifts or some way of helping you achieve the learning you want.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Then restart your laptop
Open mysterium again then open the settings page in localhost it should be online there

Then open mystnodes.com go to my nodes tab
It should be online there too

Peer2profit is VERY good you should download it and use a refferal from somewhere for each of these.

Remember, the ear canal in dogs and cats is shaped like a capital “L”. There is a vertical and horizontal canal. The easiest way to visualize the tympanum is to lift up the pinna and gently but firmly, pull it straight up towards the ceiling. This will help “straighten out” the canal so you can see the tympanum. Definitely practice on sedated or anesthetized animals whenever possible. After you see it a few times, it will become routine for you to see it.

Crackers2,"A) all cat spays flank with modified millers. I have now opted to just remove ovaries instead of OVH as according to a few studies there is no difference and I find there is less tissue handling. Will do midline spays if pregnant or fancy cat where owner is scared coat will grow back differently. I use Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, monofast/monocryl for muscle layers + SC and intradermals

B) cat neuter, incision on each testicle and autoligation. No collar or sutures or glue needed. 

C)Dog spay, modified millers around ovaries as with cat spays but will go midline. Again opting for just ovaries nowadays. Hoping to learn lap spays in future. Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures, PDS for muscle layer, monofast/monocryl for SC+intradermals

D) dog neuters pre scrotal approach, closed castration ligating modified millers. Doesn't matter the size of the dog. If elderly dog will do scrotal ablation as well as tend to find these get very bruised and huge hematomas. Tend to use monofast/monocryl for ligatures + SC + intradermals but will use Sacril/Vicryl for ligatures at times.

I’m mostly confused and nervous about the VTNE. There is SO MUCH information in those units and it’s almost impossible to know what’s super important to know and what doesn’t really matter.I’m going to try and keep going. But you’re right. I feel like most of the information that’s even tested at the end of certain units isn’t even that important to know. It’s just stressful to think about how the VTNE costs almost $350 to take. I’ve tried calling multiple vet offices to volunteer because I haven’t yet reached the end of my 2nd semester to do the internship and I haven’t found one yet that will allow me to volunteer. I wish I would’ve had the option to go to school in person but there is not one school near me that offers that course.

Greyscale_cats,"A friend of mine was rejected from her top medical school because of her major. Had fantastic grades, great letters of rec, hands-on experience in medical research and patient care…but they’d already accepted several people in that cohort with the same major and didn’t want too homogenous of a class, so she should try again next year. She went to a different school across the country instead.Yeah, we’ve seen some very strange medicine from one of the local VEG clinics. Not all cases, but some are definitely not handled appropriately whatsoever, and by the time those clients can transfer to another ER, they’re running out of money.As far as your question (why do we believe some papers and not others), I think it all just boils down to the fact that we’re human and have our own biases when it comes to what we think works and what we think doesn’t.

I’m an RVT and not a vet, but two of the four doctors I regularly work with still almost always dispense metronidazole for acute diarrhea on a negative fecal over probiotics/diet change. Why? Because it seems to work, at least in making the patient more comfortable more quickly, and thus the client is happier. However, when the tramadol papers came out a couple years ago (and I was only working with two doctors at the time), one doc kept dispensing it to his ortho cases while the other readily switched to other options. Why? Second doc felt that their patients had never seen much benefit from the tramadol anyway, and he was keen to not have to deal with dispensing a controlled substance. First doc felt like it did work for a lot of his patients and didn’t mind the controlled drug bit, until more papers came out verifying its lack of efficacy and he decided to switch to other options. 

Despite doing our best to remain impartial, sometimes we stick with things because, well, we think they work and/or it makes our lives a little simpler/easier. Definitely keep an eye on any new studies coming out that help verify findings because studies aren’t always infallible, but if this is the one bit of medicine you can’t seem to sway from because it works for you and your patients and you don’t have sufficient evidence to prove that it’s not the best choice, then keep on keeping on.I’ll be honest in that I’m biased more toward metro working for acute diarrhea cases over not. While time definitely helps the most, most of the kiddos I’ve seen over the years on probiotics and bland diets just don’t seem to clear up as readily as the ones on metro. And when a client is already stressed from dealing with a distressed animal and smelly diarrhea messes for usually days on end…Totally fair! Also one of many reasons why I’m glad I’m not the one in charge of treatment plans and prescribing meds. I’m definitely not cut out to be a doctor, haha.Super cute! Not for me thanks to pretty intense metal allergies, but you’re very talented.Why exactly do you want to be a vet? Is it the animals? If so, there are plenty of other careers you can pursue that will allow you to work with animals. If you don’t like medicine or biology, I can’t really think of any other reason why this career would be appealing to you, and if the animals are the only draw, you should further explore what vets actually do to see that the animals aren’t even the main thing they deal with and then probably reevaluate why this is the field you’re stuck on.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Varishta,"I would say your first step before pursuing this further should be to spend some time shadowing at a vet clinic. You may fall in love and discover your passion, or you may learn that you hate it just as much as your current job. Working in veterinary medicine is quite different from what most people expect, so I would first see if it even appeals to you in the first place. Loving cats is a great start, but that alone isn’t a good reason to work for a vet. Make sure you’re not putting in a ton of effort to end up right back where you are. 

If you spend some time watching the workings of a vet clinic and want to go for it, there are online courses you can take for both veterinary assistants and veterinary technicians. They are similar but different positions, especially if you are located somewhere that vet techs are required to be licensed. Vet tech comes with better pay and the ability to do more, but also means more schooling and more responsibility/stress. There are legitimate, respected vet tech schools online, but you’ll still need to find a physical clinic to work with and let you learn the physical skills involved in order to complete the program. In general, vet med is a heavily education and science based field, so more education is generally looked upon favorably, so long as it is from reputable sources.

Vet assistant doesn’t require any courses, though online courses exist and may or may not give you a boost at getting a job as an assistant. Many of them are on the job trained, but that’s easier to do if they at least have some background in working with animals. Kennel assistant is similar and also typically on the job trained, however the pay for both of these positions is usually quite low. I would check job listings in your area to see if it’s even financially feasible for you. 

The last bit of advice I have is to also consider finding a non-animal job with a better work-life balance and make volunteering with cats at the humane society or a rescue more of a hobby. Some people make a career out of something they love, and find that it takes a lot of the enjoyment out of it versus when it was a hobby or something they did in their free time. Veterinary professionals have a significantly higher rate of suicide than the general public, one of the highest suicide rates of any profession, because we are all very passionate about animals, but the nature of the job is very physically and emotionally draining. Consider if your mental and emotional health can cope with clients screaming at you and accusing you of personally murdering their dog because they didn’t bring it in soon enough or because the client can’t pay for care, cope with neglectful owners, cope with euthanizing animals that could otherwise be saved, cope with making a mistake that may cost an animal their life, and overall cope with seeing animals suffer on a daily basis. It can be a very rewarding job, but there are days where it will absolutely beat you to the ground and keep kicking while you’re there. This is why I would strongly advise shadowing before deciding if it’s for you or not. There’s nothing wrong with taking a non-animal job and making animals how you decompress in your free time instead.I wouldn’t get as hung up on taking notes about what you learn. It will likely be pretty overwhelming in the beginning, and as others have said, you’ll have years to learn that stuff in depth. Simple repeated exposure to terminology and concepts will help them stick better down the road. Have a notebook handy for sure, but don’t try to record every single thing you learn. 

If you’re in the US or would be applying to US vet schools, what I would recommend doing is taking basic notes about when you started and finished shadowing there, a record of how many hours you’ve spent there, and general notes on what you were able to do/see. Such as helping restrain patients, observing dentals and surgeries, staining slides, cleaning kennels, etc. If/when you apply to vet school, the application wants all of these details. I had a heck of a time trying to come up with start/end dates and hours of experiences I had many years prior. Keeping track of your experiences now will make that easier down the line.I didn’t find going through practice questions helpful at all other than to get comfortable with how the questions tend to be asked. Like the fact that most questions require several layers of knowledge to answer correctly. I started working through the VetPrep questions and then gave up after like 400 or so. I’m glad I didn’t waste more time on them. 

I found the PowerPages and the lectures to be significantly more helpful. I actually didn’t study from my own 3+ years of school notes hardly at all. It was just way too overwhelming and way too much to possibly cover. The PowerPages condensed topics in really helpful ways and helped me focus on the main points of the diseases, which is what is typically going to be on the NAVLE anyways. I went through and made flash cards on every single PowerPage, and a majority of the lectures, and that worked for me.

I would say the important thing to focus on is the ICVA provided list of diseases you should know, and for each one, create a couple flash cards of the main points. Focus on common signalment (especially where it makes a difference for differentials- i.e. large animal for the endless possible causes of diarrhea), which history/physical exam/lab abnormalities or patterns you typically see with it, which tests are available and how they’re used, the possible treatments, and notable side effects/concerns with those treatments. Be aware of which ones are zoonotic or ones important to public health and why. That covers the large bulk of the questions. Then brush up on your antibiotic and common parasite knowledge, a bit of epidemiology concepts/equations, and some basic business concepts, and you’ll be pretty well rounded on the necessary knowledge. I don’t understand why spending a couple hundred hours answering questions has become so many people’s main study method. If it works for you, great. But I found directly studying the diseases to be a much better use of my time.Apparently some people were getting scores with other people’s names on them. Whether it was actually their report or not I don’t know, but they tried to release them and had to retract it. Hopefully they get it sorted quick and still release them today.As someone currently in their small animal internal medicine rotation with just 2 other students, trying to keep up with multiple in-depth work ups each day plus rechecks, I’m both appalled and a little jealous that some schools have students sharing cases.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

My colleagues are what keep me coming back. PV is a money hungry group of fuck heads.Well, Hatexpensive explained mechanically above if im not mistaken. I just think it looks bad and shows the lack of care they put into their facilities, let alone its employees. Anything to cut out ways of putting money where it should go.Yea, that sounds about right. They raise our prices quarterly, and none of it goes to employees. Preying on the souls of compassionate people.I just don't get it. They try and put out this persona like they are different from other veterinary clinics when, in reality, it's all a front. They don't give a shit. They raise our prices quarterly, and we see nlany of that financial gain as employees. I'd love to try and get this to the attention of governors of our states to try and see if they could help with this issue and stop the monopoly this big corps are doing. Does anyone know if anyone has ever tried this?Yea, PV is pretty a joke in my opinion. They are like other Corps and just care about one thing $$$. It's pretty sad, and it's so obvious. They raise our prices quarterly, and none of the employees see a cent of that raise. They insult us by offer are you ready for this.....$100 GIFT CARDS if we sell more than 400k a week. How pathetic is that? Juat PAY US!We are a ER/Specialty. The only one in the area which PV knows and the are capitalizing on that. You would think we would get raises but instead they offer fucking gift cards. It's a joke man. Pv don't care about the people or pets. Thwy are full of shit. I was just reading how PV got a 2.3 billion dollar private loan for recapitalization. Priorities and management of their hospitals is all screwed upSmfh, that's so terrible, but some things i could totally see PV doing. Fucking Gino is a scumbag.It sucks because I keep hearing conflicting reports also. Referring to Pet Vet being more of the better corporations to work for, which if that's the case is f****** terrifying. I guess when I brought up the governor maybe they would be able to limit or control the monopolizing that's going on with these corporations in our field along with upping the pay like they did for Fast wood workers in CA. . I definitely do think unionization is the way to go as we tried to do that last year, and corporate came in and scared the s*** out of everybody, and we lost the fight. But things seem to be turning at our hospital and people are getting fed up and becoming more vocal so I'm trying to myself at this time see if I can regroup and get people all on the same page to push for a union. The other part about that is that there are not enough unions that are willing to support the veterinary field, which is quite sad. We definitely need it.Yeah, I'm going to look more into it and see what comes up. May I ask what Corporation you are working for now if you are with one? I will say and agree with you I'd love just about 80% of all of my colleagues for some reason Pet Vet has a way of attracting really great people and it seems like a lot of us stick around for each other which makes the vet field so special. There's so much compassion not just for the animals but for the people as well. Sometimes, it can bite you in the ass but I totally get where you're coming from. Each place brings its own pros and cons.Thank you so much for your feedback. I really appreciate it. I definitely didn't anticipate or expect it to be a ""whole new world"" and to be dealing with less b*******, but what you are saying definitely makes sense. I currently work in the surgery and ICU department, and I would love to focus more on the critical care aspects and make ICU a full-time gig. How have you enjoyed your time there at the university you are currently at? I've never thought about pursuing my VTS, but I do know that that is definitely one route to increase your financial gain. There's a guy I work with now trying to achieve his VTS at the hospital I'm at, but it seems like because we are so short-staffed, he has not had any opportunity to make this happen. Do you find it easier for people to pursue this achievement at a university setting? What about staffing? Do you feel like you guys are adequately staffed? I know the field as a whole is definitely lacking a lot of nurses, but I'm curious again if there is any difference in those areasWhen you talk about senior Veterinary students are you talking about people that are getting ready to graduate or people that have been there for several years prior to your arrival? I keep hearing out the pay is not that great which is surprising I suppose but I do like the benefits that you have mentioned. I'm noticing that as I go on in my career that yes perception and your work life balance is very key. Kind of have to weigh out the pros and cons wherever you goDo you currently work with them or at a university yourself? How was your experience been?Jesus smfh. That is such a drastic variance. Our facility right now does the same thing but the gaps are not that large but I don't understand again how such a facility would pay their staff so little. Especially a university I mean I got to imagine that bringing in a pretty good amount of money. Are you still working with them at this time or did you move forward onto a different facility?Gotcha. Well I definitely sounds like a place to grow your skill set which is really nice especially being around students like that. How have you enjoyed your time working in this setting? Do you find you and your staff are adequately paid and supported?Man I got to be honest I'm really Blown Away with the lack of pay at these facilities. If you don't mind me asking or you can message me I'm just curious how much you are making as an RVT. I don't know why I had it in my head that working for a university would be better off financially. I will say it's kind of a relief to hear that the benefits are substantially betterI feel it. Sometimes, we just gotta make the most of our situation until we can get to our final destination. I'm Surprised to hear the lack of emphasis on RVTs. The state I'm in, they almost praise them too much. Its kinda ridiculous but I'm just trying to survive $$Thank you for all of this. I really appreciate you taking the time to give me all this information. Another thing from one nurse to another is that I want to thank you for all your commitment and dedication to all the pets you have seen over your career. To be honest with you, I don't think myself I could have endured or stuck around as long as you have so a lot of respect to you for that. It sounds like partially the university system is just as broken as a corporate setting just in different ways. 50k a year is definitely not enough for anyone now a days let alone a person with your experience and licensing. Side bar here, but what department do you work in at your specialty? Do you find that other departments are paid higher than yours?Sadly, when the corporation came and bought our hospital, they let go of a lot of people.

bevmoification,"Former EMT here, imo if an accident occurs on a highway or in an area where there is moving traffic, the scene is generally unsafe, especially if the vehicles involved are located in the middle of a road/freeway. Unless you are in an extremely rural area, there is generally no good reason to stop and the best thing you can do is call for emergency services and give any information you can (ie: there's an accident involving 2 vehicles in the first lane, located on I-80 E about 0.5mi before exit XYZ). We covered good Samaritan laws pretty extensively, generally they are in place to protect people with no medical training and unfortunately we live in a litigious society. Scene safety aside, motor accidents can have complications like spinal injuries and moving someone can aggravate said injury.

ilovespaghettibolog,"I feel like I wrote this! Every time I use an otoscope everything is blurry as hell. I have no idea how to fix it and no one knows how to help me haha. But I don’t work GP so it hasn’t been much of a problem… so farWow thanks for your comment. That was very insightful. You’re right about the part that it’s probably my mind playing tricks on me and that I’m being too hard on myself. It’s so so hard to fight that battle against my own brain, especially when I’m so tired all the time. I may try to talk to my internship director but I’m scared. I don’t know what they could offer to help me feel better. I also don’t want them to feel like I’m dumping my problems onto them. I started therapy and it hasn’t really helped so far. I do want to see a Dr and hopefully get on some anti anxiety medication. 

I feel like I actually have it pretty good in my internship. The specialists are generally nice and willing to teach. We always work with another admitting vet on ER. We mostly get 2 days off a week. But somehow that makes me feel worse? Like if I can barely survive this internship then I really must not be cut out for this haha. Also, We do have a lot of didactics which is great but at the same time a huge struggle for me. It’s hard to prepare for presentations when I just crash on my days off. 

In regards to mistakes, I’ve definitely made big ones. I’ve sent a dog home on ER that I diagnosed with IMHA without any pred after they declined admission. They ended up coming back, was admitted, threw a clot, was euthanized. I misdiagnosed CHF and rounded the case to the ECC specialist, he had to tell the owner it wasn’t actually CHF. In general on ER, I have no idea what I’m doing or what I’m saying to the owners. I feel so bad because they could be getting better care if another vet saw their pet.I’m going to message you if that’s okay!Is 6 month slump a thing?? Also, I’m grateful that my internship has didactics, but all of that is starting to feel overwhelming!! There’s only so much work I feel like can be done at home in my time off before I start to lose it. 

Some little mistakes like making typos in discharges and forgetting to confirm med doses with the owners on specialty rotations. Then some big ones on ER like not prescribing pred when the owners elected outpatient management for an immune mediated disease. Diagnosing CHF and rounding the case to our ECC specialist when it wasn’t CHF (I had already told the owners it was). Other things like being the slowest intern on ER in terms of # of cases seen per shift and also requiring the most support for said cases. I also just don’t like ER in general which adds to the anxiety in regards to work.Ugh I can relate to this so much. I’m a new grad doing a rotating internship and it’s like all my mistakes/stressful events are compiling in my mind and they’re getting worse with time. I’m also struggling with not comparing myself to my other intern, because I’m definitely the weakest intern. feel tremendous anxiety and get sweaty whenever I think of work. You’re not alone!! 

I started therapy recently and I’m hoping it will help me. I am also trying to remind myself that I’m trying my best and that I’m a human who is allowed to make mistakes. That I’m working at my own pace and that it’s okay if I’m not as good as the other interns. I think as students we strive for perfection in order to succeed in vet school and to even get into vet school.

Purity14,"According to your own posts in discord, You currently have special ""corp partners"".These ""corp partners"" send their traffic through only one or two nodes on the network.

No one knows who they are, you wont tell us who they are, and they only use the same specific nodes, always.As such, the majority of the traffic that is passed through the mysterium network is sent through these nodes. (500gb in less than 9 days on one node) Leaving piecemeal for everyone else.

Currently, the only way to access the myst network is via an android app, selecting a node, and then connecting to it.

You dont have a windows app, you dont have an ios, or osx app, or a linux app so how are these partner nodes connecting?Why cant the client that they are using be shared with the public for us to use?The remainder of the traffic is being sent through android apps, which again, is piecemeal.

I am going to go out on a limb here and suggest that mysterium are just running their own datacentre node, funnelling their ""corp partner"" data through the datacentre node, cashing in on the ""corp partner cash"" and then using this money to pay piecemeal to the node runners.

I believe that mysterium is just running a run of the mill VPN service. And that mysterium is just a vanity project.

&#x200B;

Question 1: Can you confirm or deny that you run any sort of nodes yourselves?

Node runners used to earn $50 pcm, then $25 pcm, and now they are lucky if they earn $3 or $4 pcm. The amount of node runners that have left the network is tremendous.

Question 2: What are you looking at doing to retain node runners when they arent even meeting the minimum monthly withdrawal amounts anymore?

Question 3: Node runners are told that in order to get traffic, they need to turn ""whitelisted traffic off"" You actually recommend they do this in discord. This shifts the liability onto the node runner. So that should someone use their node for child porn, they are on the hook for it legally. The solution is to put your node on whitelist to stop this from happening. But whitelisted traffic only comes from partners. And that only goes to specific nodes, so you end up with no traffic. Can you explain how you will end this cycle of liability vs traffic.

Question 4: how are your ""corp partners"" putting almost 100gb of traffic through the ""selected"" nodes per day, what app are they using, when seemingly no other app apart from the android one works?Bonus Question: If they are using something other than the android app, why dont you release it, because it clearly works. Can Corp Partners select a node? Can we see what the corp partner client looks like, with a demonstration of its usage please.

Mysterium VPN actually is connecting to a VPN server hosted on residential houses. Is not a proxy at all.

I assume you understand the difference between proxy and VPN. Then Mysterium VPN is connecting to residential VPN servers, where people like me have a homelab server or a raspberry pi and setup a VPN server (pre-packaged) by Mysterium. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/12p57zi/does_mysterium_basically_function_as_connecting/jgkzr2c/  Actually this is the strength from Mysterium. Given thats its a residential IP its very hard for websites to identify thosr IP as proxy or a VPN server. Because they are not hosted in a datacenter and the ISP is an actual provider not a datacenter provider.

All this is taken onto account by services and websites to flag it as a VPN and block certain services like streaming.

So, from a service or website perspective he will think you are a legitimate user from whatever country the VPN is based on.

I tested this thoroughly and Mysterium VPNZ always gave me the best privacy and service availability compared with other VPN or proxy services. Specially because VPN tunnels all System connections while Proxy only does http and https connection ""handover"". ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/12p57zi/does_mysterium_basically_function_as_connecting/jgl249v/  My guess, the company vpn is still running in the background blocking the resource.

Try to find the PID in activity monitor and go to command line and do:

Sudo kill -9 ""PID""

Then try to connect again with Myst.

Keep in mind that killing it through activity monitor sometimes triggers a restart on the app and lunches again. Command line will kill it instead. Had this issue with Global Protect on company Macbook also. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11g9uuf/could_connect_now_cannot_thoughts_on_what_logs_to/janl3gb/  Its probably because some files or folders are not being removed.

Try this:

-sudo apt purge myst*

-sudo apt install locate

-sudo updatedb

-sudo locate myst

Then after uninstalling Myst with the first command, locate will find any file or folder with word ""Myst"" and you can then track down what folders/files remain. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10y3w96/how_can_uninstall_myst/j7w2k0t/  My pleasure. 😇 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10y3w96/how_can_uninstall_myst/j7wpt32/  Hey!! There are some points you should know:

- Cloud Node runners dont earn as much as residential nodes. Check out Mysterium documentation to understand more. I ran it for some time in Oracle free and is not worth it. On the other residential makes me 5€ a week aprox.

- Oracle Cloud Free has a policy against mining and cripto, etc...they will ban your account after the 1 year review usually. I lost my account because of this and once your banned is virtually impossible to bypass their paying mechanism when registering with other emails, credit cards, etc...as they build a profile around all your gathered data and blacklist you. Is not worth loosing an Oracle Always free account if you have one.

Cheers! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/zzg5sk/running_a_node_on_oc_always_free/j2boa2z/  Oracle is quite sketchy about their TOS. They don't honor them and they claim always free accounts whenever they want. Any excuse is good for them...it's a coin toss, just check forums of Oracle closed accounts. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/zzg5sk/running_a_node_on_oc_always_free/j2f95pp/  I would just uninstall and remove all traces of mining on OC if you want to keep the account.

But it could be too late already, convert free tier to a pay as you go account might help.

Other than that the process is well documented by users. Everything is fully automated and Oracle is not keen to support you at all.

Someone documented this already and is exactly the same to my experience.

LAST 24H and Last 7 days work.

So for 30 days I rather trust what Mystnodes.com..

But sometimes if you change between last 24 and last 7 days and then back to last 30 days you can check id value changes (due to the refresh meaning its indeed showing 30 days) or if it doesnt it means timeout during the query. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/zps39n/mystnodescom_vs_nodeui/j0uhlz0/  External address from tx should match with the metamask address. 

If thats not matching try checking what address did you setup in the node as payment address and correct  that to match your wallet address. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/zphv65/settlements_not_showing_up_in_metamask/j0tgpw0/  It doesnt matter if its Linux, Docker, Windows. The Node UI is the same, just go to the Node UI and change the settlement address. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/zphv65/settlements_not_showing_up_in_metamask/j0wmcbr/  I use Kali on and off and use MystVPN for a full privacy mode with Kali and Myst.

Although its not based on arch, I've also encountered this issue. I was able to fix it when I realized is because I had Hotspotshield and MystVPN installed together. Issue is that they overlap interfaces for VPN....

Try uninstalling any other VPN provider you might have installed. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/zd2hjt/is_anyone_here_using_an_arch_linux_based_distro/iyziytb/  I would say Pihole wouldn't affect Mysterium connections as they have they own dns settings and not using the ones assigned from Mysterium. At least for the clients connecting to your node.

For the application connections they will use your Pihole settings or upstream dns and they should work just fine.

I'm running pihole on my environment and have a separate device where I'm running Mysterium and works just fine.

For deeper I got no idea.... ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z6jfwh/myst_node_on_pihole_server_and_deeper_min/iy2nv8u/  I never realized this. I've checked on google apps this and since I'm from Spain, reviews are in Spanish, and they are overall good with all types of good and bad comments. Mostly good though.I doubt Mysterium bought any type of reviews. But in any case, I've been using their product since January (node runner and consumer) their technology is safe and legit. It provides a VPN service and there are no issues around it.So, I'm not sure what ""trust"" factor should ""nose dive"" because of this.  


Maybe they just wanted to traction going towards their product (ads, tweets, referrals, etc) which is perfectly normal.... marketing.

If you really want to measure trust on crypto projects, this should be your reference: [https://www.certik.com/projects/mysterium](https://www.certik.com/projects/mysterium)

-I stated Spanish comments don't seem to behave with fake comments.....

-I justified this as a possible marketing technique and downplayed it. Since I don't believe this is a trust issue as you put it, I gave you the BEST website for evaluating Crypto projects. CERTIK which is a company that does security assessments of the code, community and contract.

I just don't think is a big deal as you put it. Marketing that's all... If product is good and third party security company audits have high scores, why wouldn't I trust it? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z5za2w/lets_talk_about_how_90_of_the_android_app_google/iy0gdsn/  Initially MYST was lunched on the Ethereum network. But given that gas fees where so high within Ethereum, they decided to move to Polygon (layer 2 of Ethereum Network) since gas fees are cents.

This is critical for doing payouts for node runners since you need to pay gas fees.

Ethereum address has been maintained so that anyone still holding MYST on the Ethereum network can migrate through bridge to a Polygon Network.

In other words:

Forget about Ethereum network and MYST in Ethereum network, given that you started 2 months ago.

I'm a Mysterium Ambassador and all this information is gathering and RESEARCH I did on my own. Just in case it might differ from the official story. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z2yk68/why_are_there_2_myst_contract_addresses/ixj7q0b/  No need to thank me, my pleasure. I'm glad I was able to help you. I'm a Cybersecurity Engineer. You know how this goes, sometimes you help, other times your able to help.

As long as we can contribute and someone else does the same, we have a healthy community and knowledge keeps spreading 😉 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z2yk68/why_are_there_2_myst_contract_addresses/ixjgfpv/  You will have MYST on Eth network. But unable to actually use it. Issue with ETH network is the high transaction fees. Lower than it used to be, but still higher than Polygon (Layer 2 Ethereum Network).

So if you want to send your 10 dollars to a myst wallet to use it, if you have to pay 10 additional as fees for the ethereum network....it just defies the purpose.

Myst on ETH is no longer used, swap it to Matic and then to Myst. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z2yk68/why_are_there_2_myst_contract_addresses/jgl046m/  It should be recoverable.

Actually MYST is on of the crypto that retains stability better than any other, but all got affected due to FTX exchange crash. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/yttjwo/myst_tokens_are_losing_value/iw6k992/  Also it depends on your country law. Lots of countries in Europe and rest of the world (aside from US) don't care nor worry about copyright material or lack the time and interest to chase the random Joe 14 year old at his grandma house downloading Sims 2.

But as said depends on your country laws... ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ys8h61/do_those_who_host_take_on_potential_legal/ivxwijb/  I totally understand. But that's beyond your reach and responsability.

If people opening a coffee shop provide an internet service for their clients, is not their fault that the client misused his service to commit illegal activities. 

If you create blades and knifes for kitchen and someone stabs someone else with one of your products, is not your responsability either. 

You are providing a service to improve privacy and security, that's all your doing. Privacy and technology should not be the ""sacrifice"" to prevent those situations. 

Look at Apple when mass shooting happens and perpetrator had an IPhone and policy request to unlock it... 

Careful with that mindset, or you will be sacrificing liberty and privacy for just a bunch of idiots doing illegal activities and providing your data blindly to ISP and governments with their own agenda. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ys8h61/do_those_who_host_take_on_potential_legal/ivy0dzr/  I work as a cybersecurity engineer and have been involved in police cases regarding similar topics in Spain, Europe.

Depends on your country laws, but overall they can only prove that your IP was the one involved in the traffic. This does not mean that You are guilty. In a civil case you can prove you do no have possession of such content and provide them with your PC and all requested items if needed. Show that you are serving as part of a decentralized VPN and this is not something you are responsable of.

Police in a civil case have to prove beyond reasonable doubt your are indeed the perpetrator of this activity.

You hired the ISP for providing internet to yourself, why police should go after you and not the ISP in a similar manner? Or what if your wifi is not password protected? Or you rent your house or share house with other guests doing such illegal activity?

As you see this would not hold on a civil court. I've been involved in such cases and judges and lawyers are very ignorant of technology law (GDPR) or how technology work. They don't go after you through those methods since it's a very grey area and need to prove your guilty beyond reasonable doubt. They would also need to hire a forensic security analyst and wait for the results (more costly).

I can think of many other reasons but I think my point is clear enough. Been running node for almost year and a half...no issues at all.

Cheers!! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ys8h61/do_those_who_host_take_on_potential_legal/ivyifwz/  There are no APY stats. I know someone was building them manually from a spreadsheet of their staked tokens.

I have staked a lot, around 500€ and currently got 20 Myst staked or so in 6 months? Not sure.

I think the APY was around 2% or less. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y81c6h/where_can_i_find_the_apy_stats_for_staking_as_a/isxhpwh/  I think this is the opposite since  B2B was implemented and its more profitable....but to be honest the less the better. The algorithm pays more when less nodes. So  if that were to be the case, enjoy while you can. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y75js9/nodes_are_decreasing/issqyoz/  Docker? Linux or Windows machine? Some info would be great? Open ports??? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y49xuv/need_help_trouble_shooting_please_help/isecm4t/  And Im guessing your talking about the client and not the server.

Try uninstalling other VPNS you might have installed. Sometimes they collide and show errors because they set the same adapter tunnel.

Also reinstall Mysterium, don't forget to backup your secret key or you will loose your Myst Tokens that you already bought. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y49xuv/need_help_trouble_shooting_please_help/isnaamg/  Read the docs before renting VPS for a project and wastinf money!!!! 🤣

Yes indeed, residential are the ones favored by the algorithm and not VPS.

Why? Because VPS IP are shown as a datacenter IP and therefore flagged by service providers like Netflix as a possible VPN.

Between other reasons.... ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y3lc4u/zero_earning_on_vps/is9djkv/  For the sake of others reading this:

https://docs.mysterium.network/for-node-runners/intros-mysterium-node

Check section:

Network Pricing Rules ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y3lc4u/zero_earning_on_vps/is9wsyd/  I thought there was no difference......why negligible, is there any small factor that might be take into account? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xrlylm/hey_people_is_there_a_difference_in_earnings_if/iqgz4cx/  Hey u/peter-sovietsquirrel care to give some feedback on my question? Ive deployed a Linux repo node (good revenue), Docker Winodws node ( great revenue, might be even slightly better) and then a docker Linux node (not that good).   


So I was wondering how does this affect the revenue...I thought it should be transparent for the network and clients...Maybe Im wrong...just trying to understand what is better. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xrlylm/hey_people_is_there_a_difference_in_earnings_if/ir7pyl3/  Hey! Mysterium ambassador here.

So in Europe and other countries we don't have this issue where ISP spy our content and trace it back to us. So it's usually fine to run a node.

In US this is not the case with some ISP, so my recommendation usually is to find out if your ISP is one of those ""send you piracy letter types"" or not. If it is, please enable the option on your Node to only allow ""safe whitelisted traffic"". I know since latest node update this option has been broken down onto more options, but this should give you a hint on what to configure.

Cheers! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/ipy4acu/  Really? Never saw this before? Can you share the link? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/ipy4elz/  So I guess ISP shouldn't run internet provider services because someone could use their network to download child porn.

Or even better, we should stop creating knifes because some people use them to stab....

This is not a technology issue but a human issue. Running a node ensures privacy, security and provides this to others in some countries that don't have the freedom we enjoy. If not just check what is happening with IRAN right now....

Of course people are always going to ""use this for bad purposes"" but we can't let this be the reason for humans to not keep advancing technologically. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/ipy4o14/  This is not usual in Europe. Are you sure this is done? I read that this started on 2009 only in France but soon it was ended.

https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.bbc.com/news/technology-23252515.amp ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/iq91knq/  The way I see it, I'm paying already a monthly fee for internet I don't use at night or I can share...

Getting payed for sharing it looks like a pretty good deal to me (as long as its secured and they cant access my Internal network), specially If I'm able to help someone who just wants access to Netflix on my country or simply be more secure and private....

If I really want to be super safe on content being access from my house, I can just enable the ""whitelisted traffic on Myst""....

I honestly don't see an issue with running a node at my house. But that's my personal opinion. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/ipydxhp/  Yep, then your wrong. As I linked and you can research on wikipedia and other platforms HAPODI law was enforced on 2009 and was banned in 2013. France has no longer this law.

They have created a new one called ARCOM. But the penalties are no longer in effect from HADOPI unless you get a notice and you still keep doing it.

So far, NO ONE from Mysterium Community has reported this in France.

So im quite sure, that this is probably just for big pirate websites distributions and not the regular joe downloading SIM 4. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/iqc85ib/  Good afternoon.

No it's not possible. Openvpn was the old implementation now we use wireguard and even so, the clients needs to have integration with Nodes in blockchain to be able to charge you for your consumption of bandwith, etc.

Cheers! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vjmsny/mysterium_on_openvpn/idjuwa2/  What do you mean? What needs to be up again? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vc75ki/when_will_this_be_up_again/icczlik/  Im not from Finland, but yes there are lots of node runners you can check country here:

https://stats.mysterium.network/?orgId=1

If you have any question related specifically to Finland I recommend you checking  our discord channel. Might find some other Finland Node runners, maybe your question might be also related to others.  


https://discord.gg/NPfU9KTQ ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/v11lbb/anyone_running_node_from_finland/iak4q36/  Obviously not. Mysterium VPN requires you to pay in MYST to accept the connections, is blockchain based and lots of other ""differences"".

Because Mysterium uses Wireguard, doesn't mean you can connect with vanilla wireguard to Mysterium Nodes.

Have you tried Wireguard itself? You require open ports, public IP and key exchange. Which is not what you require in Mysterium. In Mysterium you require Node ID, MYST token and some open ports on the node runner side.

Short story: No you can't. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/v01kjk/is_there_any_way_i_can_connect_to_specific_node/iaeof2n/  I'm not having any issues so far, this has to be something on your end. Probably network issues.... ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uy5m0m/mysterimum_is_super_lagging_recently/iaeovv6/  Maybe some sort of bottleneck issue on their side or lots of traffic from people working remotely. They should inform though if they are having an issue on their side.... ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uy5m0m/mysterimum_is_super_lagging_recently/iaiuxo7/  Could you maybe change your DNS to cloudflare ones 1.1.1.1 and 1.0.0.1 to test if maybe this is a resolution error? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uy5m0m/mysterimum_is_super_lagging_recently/iairkor/  I work in Cybersecurity as a Cybersecurity Analyst, also have previous knowledge with court cases involved with Cyber.

I'm incredibly involved with this project, and I think it's one of the best solutions for your freedom/security/privacy on the net, so regarding your point if Mysterium is secure I will try to cover all points:

* Smart Contract Security: Verified and audited by Certik  
[https://www.certik.com/projects/mysterium](https://www.certik.com/projects/mysterium)
* External Report Linux Node Security: This is an external security report made with Qualys of my Oracle Hosted Linux Node. The node is just an Ubuntu Instance updated to latest that only has exposed 4449 to internet (don't even need to expose that, I do it for convenience for management).  
[Qualys Vulnerability Report of Mysterium Exposed Node](https://cloudflare-ipfs.com/ipfs/QmV42NgCcvb5sJbkj5CuCTRvW8rSe8htCUG7NYMRhDqFsz)  

* Source is opensource and code can always be reviewed:  
[https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node](https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node)
* All communications are done through Wireguard so your communications are encrypted with SSL. That leaves the node runner or anyone else in the same network for that matter unable to analyze your traffic or inspect it. They would only see scrambled that if they chose to analyze this with Wireguard.
* Law wise is dependent on your country...there is 1 known issue in Germany in 5 years and is recommended to then enable ""Only partner traffic"" which is a whitelisted traffic.But in other EU countries there are no issues, I live in Spain and there are no issues law wise.
* Ask yourself, if you were part victim of a botnet and involved in a global DDOS scenario, would you be culprit of this? No. Same applies here, you're just opening your network as a VPN provider.Court cases need evidence that you are indeed the one that perpetrated the attack, you could be sharing a rented house with Airbnb to a hacker, that during his stay does an attack. Owning the public IP does not mean much as evidence. Public IP rotate and they would also need ISP to provide that you had that public IP at given attack time. This a complex concept and owning a public IP is not evidence enough to make you culprit.
* In regard to logs, this is what Mysterium devs told me:

>\- By default, wireguard stores connected IP addresses on the host to maintain a connection. Connection (node service) logs could be queried for e.g. with Journalctl utility (on Linux): sudo journalctl -u mysterium-node.service or saved directly into the file. To view logs in realtime: sudo journalctl -fu mysterium-node.service.

Although it allows to monitor peers IP addresses or session specific data, all of the sensitive traffic uses HTTPS connections, which is encrypted from the client to the end server. Exit node runners can play the traffic with a Wireshark etc., but this traffic encrypted and it’s not possible to decrypt it on the provider level, so it’s useless for them.

There is no way from user perspective to export (just view) all of the provider specific sessions and locations (could be a feature request for component NodeUI). Although they can grab some data from local database it's not much usable. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uws8wa/any_security_related_risk_from_running_a_node/i9ucaxt/  Oh yeah definitely. I live in Spain, in Spain we have one of the most flexible laws towards ISP privacy and security. I've been running it with this option disabled almost for a year with no issues.

In Spain you can download torrents or whatever, no one will care. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uws8wa/any_security_related_risk_from_running_a_node/im8mahf/  Again, doesn't make any sense. If you do the same in a library connection, Starbucks wifi, hotel, etc. Would that mean the shop owner is responsible? What about if I hack my neighbour's wifi and do that?

Get informed please before spreading fear. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uws8wa/any_security_related_risk_from_running_a_node/kj4h0u6/  Hey!

From the client perspective nothing. He is connected to your Node but he can't see your internal network. Nor he has access to change anything. He will just see the Public IP and location of that IP since he is getting assigned your public IP.

From ISP perspective they will see what the already see....traffic, url visited, etc etc...but wont be able to know if its you or someone else in your network. Which us why decentralized logs are so important. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uws8wa/any_security_related_risk_from_running_a_node/iq9nubf/  As long as you have a wallet address  in the Polygon Network you should be able to receive donations of Myst.

Just download Metamask and add the Polygon Network to it. Then share your wallet address to whoever you want so they can send Myst over to you.

Also add Mysterium token address to your wallet so that Metamask identifies the token and is displayed.

Mysterium token address is:

0x1379e8886a944d2d9d440b3d88df536aea08d9f3

You can find this on coingecko. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uvvmi6/mysterium_wallet_address/i9nz47z/  Indeed this has been removed. Although if you really have issues paying that 1 dollar, if you join the Discord Team and ask the admins of Mysterium team, they might be willing to help you pay this fee. Seen this in the past, you might get lucky.

Cheers! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/utqesk/no_free_option/i9b8q01/  I agree with you. Not only that, it also is a great stable coin to invest when Bear market.

Recently it was at 30 cents. Being able to buy Mysterium now at 16 cents and stake/hold waiting for 30 cents value to come back is a great investment. You can safely say that when back to 30 cents you will double your gains in an almost stable coin. 

At least thats my feeling. Not as boring as a stable coin, not as risky as any other crypto.

Would also add that the community is growing and fresh, giving you a great chance to participate and be involved deeply with the team and community. I was able to be ambassador, develop a portable client for Mysterium and support on github issues. This is a project with real utility and achievement in their goals.

 Can't say the same for lots for other crypto that are smoke and mirrors and hoping for moon. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uqx6bj/this_is_why_i_think_mysterium_has_the_best_dpn/i8y44c3/  Hi, provide me your Node ID. I will connect refreshing Hermes for your Node so that it will display all the Myst you had (if you had any) and check if new Node is operational.

Also restart services usually fixes those errors. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uoq4rk/node_identity_not_found/i8y4zqz/  Good morning.

My suggestion is to download the mobile client and get some MYST onto your account and manually connect to your Node.

I own 3 nodes and 2 of them are cloud based. It wasn't until I connected to my own node that I realized that some Iptables issue was preventing traffic and connections going through my cloud nodes.

I suggest you to connect from Mobile to your own Node, using your Node ID. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/umydb5/testing_connection/i85bi0p/  Yes there is. Also even Linux. Check the release VPN desktop mysterium website right here to download the .dmg for Macos

https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/mysterium-vpn-desktop/releases/tag/10.9.0

Cheers! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/umydb5/testing_connection/i85bw6u/  I use Oracle Cloud and Linux Ubuntu Instances there come prehardened with some Iptables/netplan/firewalld obscure configs.

I had to uninstall firewalld and reset iptables configs to make it work.

I opened an issue and Mysterium team gladly pointed this issue to me.

https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node/issues/5006#event-6464280160 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/umydb5/testing_connection/i85g4ta/  No worry mate, my pleasure!

I recommend you checking Oracle Cloud free tier. Its free forever and you get 1 arm machine with 4 cores and 24 gigs of ram, aside from the regular X86-X64 arquitecture also free. No limit use just limit of specs. I host them on Netherlands and they do get connections, but yes is not as profitable as residential.

Also keep in mind the longer you host them and they are operational, the better score of quality your Node gets. This will increase the visibility of your Node eventually.

I also recommend you dropping by Mysterium Discord channel. People are nice and help each other a lot, they building slowly a community. 

Cheers! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/umydb5/testing_connection/i85hlif/  Hi!

Do you have an oracle or Ubuntu distro? Issue is Iptables, I cleaned it and allowed connections. You also have to allow connections and ports in Firewall in Oracle. Create and Ingress rule I believe. Let me know if you still have issues after reviewing that.

Currently Im a bit short on time, but if you still have issues I can check my configs and share screenshots. Let me know if you can sort this out with those tips I gave you, if not I will share screenshots.

Cheers! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/umydb5/testing_connection/i8y2xs1/  Whats the issue? Where are you stuck? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ujgbt5/censorship_in_china/i7ix1yg/  Are you hosting a Mysterium VPN Node or are you talking about the client VPN? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ujgbt5/censorship_in_china/i7k3iyk/  Do you have the latest version??? Please download the latest and check again if this issue persists.

https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/mysterium-vpn-desktop/releases

If you have money on your Mysterium wallet, dont forget to export keystore.json and import it on the new version so you have the same wallet address and funds. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ujgbt5/censorship_in_china/i7qrtf4/  Hi.

Im willing to spend some time to troubleshoot this with you. I think China market is a big one and if this is an issue is a great loss.

Can you dm me so we can do a Discord session?

I believe we might be able to bypass this if we set the DNS to cloudflare or other providers instead of your ISP DNS. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ujgbt5/censorship_in_china/i8y5ryq/  Hi is this still an issue? Have you sort this out. Let me know! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ui41ok/please_help_me_with_the_registration_fee/i8y5v7y/  Hi!

That looks great, thanks for helping build a better web3 privacy oriented internet.

Also, keep in mind that VPS connections provide less rewards if thats what ur after. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uf6dim/my_first_month_with_myst_nodes_8_vps_node_result/i6roq4l/  Have you tried restarting the node? Could it be that the settings displayed just need a restart in order to be refreshed. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uebhe9/have_problem_changing_external_wallet_address/i6moo8n/  I think I had this behaviour last week. Its probably a bug introduced in latests version. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uebhe9/have_problem_changing_external_wallet_address/i7k3fys/  They just released a new version which I think fixes this. Update your node!  


https://www.mysterium.network/post/mysterium-node-introduces-auto-withdrawal ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/uebhe9/have_problem_changing_external_wallet_address/i7plqge/  I suggest you to ask in the Discord Mysterium. Devs are super helpful and I've seen them before help people with the registration fees. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ucev2b/convert_sol_to_myst/i6aqazn/  Is it always the same size and time? 

The connections made my devs are usually smaller in size and time, those connections are done to check Node status and quality of Node.

It could be the case that in order to check Quality of Node devs have automated a speed quality check that consumes that amount. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ubeaq2/are_the_myst_devs_trying_to_make_the_chain_look/i63u6tg/  Well, most residential houses have dynamic public IP so I wouldn't worry too much. Your public Ip will rotate eventually and problem solved.

In regards to you VPN users, you can't block them. It's supposed to be as anonymous as possible for them. If you can identify them somehow, that defeats the purpose of the VPN.

If you want to be as safe as possible you can enable only verified partner  traffic. But that wouldn't solve your issue, since it's not malicious traffic but an activity of spamming itself.

Have you checked that maybe you got a new IP that was already reported as spam? That could be the case also.... ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u89hc7/can_i_block_a_client_from_connecting_to_my_node/i5l7jeh/  Hey!

Im a Mysterium Ambassador and Im gathering some resources to answer this type of questions.  Let me show point some of the resources that I've already gathered. In the future I intend on documenting this and making a thread for wider visibility.

* **Smart Contract Security: V**erified and audited by Certik [https://www.certik.com/projects/mysterium](https://www.certik.com/projects/mysterium)
* **External Report Linux Node Security:** This is an external security report made with Qualys of my Oracle Hosted Linux Node. The node is just an Ubuntu Instance updated to latest that only has exposed 4449 to internet (don't even need to expose that, I do it for convenience for management).[https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV42NgCcvb5sJbkj5CuCTRvW8rSe8htCUG7NYMRhDqFsz](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmV42NgCcvb5sJbkj5CuCTRvW8rSe8htCUG7NYMRhDqFsz)

I'm planning to add later this afternoon the internal reports. In any case, source is opensource and code can always be reviewed:

[https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node](https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node)

As mentioned by u/peter-sovietsquirrel, all communications are done through Wireguard so your communications are encrypted with SSL. That leaves the node runner or anyone else in the same network for that matter unable to analyze your traffic or inspect it. They would only see scrambled that if they chose to analyze this with Wireguard.

In regard to logs, this is what Mysterium devs told me:

>By default, wireguard stores connected IP addresses on the host to maintain a connection. Connection (node service) logs could be queried for e.g. with Journalctl  utility (on Linux): sudo journalctl -u mysterium-node.service or saved directly into the file. To view logs in realtime: sudo journalctl -fu mysterium-node.service.  
>  
>Although it allows to monitor peers IP addresses or session specific data, all of the sensitive traffic uses HTTPS connections, which is encrypted from the client to the end server. Exit node runners can play the traffic with a Wireshark etc., but this traffic encrypted and it’s not possible to decrypt it on the provider level, so it’s useless for them.  
>  
>There is no a way from user perspective to export (just view) all of the provider specific sessions and locations (could be a feature request for component NodeUI). Although they can grab some data from local database it's not much usable. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u17vp5/security_of_using_mystermium_vpn/i4fmj9v/  Hey there!!

That's actually a really good idea, also interested for Analitic purposes. I'm a Mysterium Ambassador I will try check with the team and also check within my node. See if I can come back soon with an answer. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u0m3wi/export_or_savebackup_session_history_of_mystberry/i47jsat/  Since this is the correct answer through API I will save this for further requests of the same type. Thanks u/WarrenTheWarren!! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u0m3wi/export_or_savebackup_session_history_of_mystberry/i4f5dnh/  Hi.

Let me answer, rewards are based on your location and consumer base. I would also say that ""how safe running a node"" is also based on location.

I live in Spain and Ive been running for 45 days my node. I have earned around 80-90 Myst. Which is about 30 euro aprox (great since it pays 2/3 of my Internet bill and I help to create an anonymous network and support privacy).

Now to the topic at hand, Id say its safe for you as long as your ISP doesnt care. In Spain and many other EU countries your ISP is not allowed to spy on you, so your ISP doesnt care. You went get any penalties, other countries like USA might have an issue and ban you from using their ISP as  network provider.

Legally speaking, in 3-4 years of project there has been only 1 case of legal court issues in Germany. Thats why is advised to run the ""whitelist partner option"" for node runners in Germany.

Make your own decisions based on that. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/i41vbea/  Exactly. I work as a Cybersecurity Engineer and been involved on cases also. This is 100% accurate in short words. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/jc6w59s/  I'm sorry. I don't understand or get your message. I think it's quite toxic and misleading. Of course, everyone has unique experience....

Let me ask you. Youve been running 17 nodes...all residential? Or cloud hosted? Cloud hosted is not profitable at all, of course. If it was residential, do you have 17 different ISP's?? 

In any case, depends on your location and country. If you live in a country where your ISP spies on you and are able to get a DMCA is exactly WHY you need a VPN. As a client, not as a node runner. This solution is exactly to give freedom, privacy back. To those countries where your ISP spies on you or there is censorship.

In EU we don't have that sort of issue. Some members from USA have also reported good profit and no issues with their ISP running Mysterium.

But saying it's a dead project? Moon boys? Opium Folks? Man no one is pumping numbers here, nor doing FUD or selling you anything based on hope. It's a token that has an ACTUAL use case and utility.

But yeah whatever.... I guess you're the typical cripto boy that jumps onto projects and starts asking: When moon? When Lambo?

Just don't misinform people. This projects still in Beta and this will evolve and get better. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/i42sb2l/  Its highly unlikely that someone is able to take over your host when connecting as a client. This is because they are assigned a different network and have no internal access to your home network.

In any case, worst scenario where they leverage an unknown vulnerability exploit. They will only have access to your host. That's why I would recommend running this as a docker container or a VM where host is isolated and has no access to your network by just opening ports from the VM or docker to your router through NAT.

But that's just extra steps....I ran a vulnerability scanner on the node and no vulnerabilities where found on the application itself.

Cheers. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/jc6wout/  Most of my connections are from EU and North Africa, Asia or Middle East. I have Fibre Optics 600Mbs on a Gigabit connection. Homelab Server 24/7.

Now, on a daily basis that doesn't add much money, but whatever, I'm in for the long term and it's a great way to support privacy and decentralization.

Sometimes there is a random guy from Netherlands that seeds torrents or streams, sucking 500-800 Gbs during 2 days straight.

That's my ""sugar daddy"" he pays 2/3 of my Internet bill. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/i42yrlx/  Yes the whitelist partner option is an URL filtering to legal and secure sites. So all Ilegal stuff is blocked, keep in mind that using that option will limit your traffic and you will gain less rewards at expense of security.

I work in Cybersecurity, but I'm an advocate of privacy and security. Unless you live on USA or Germany or your country has ISP spying on you, I dont see benefit on enabling this feature. But if your afraid ANY possible repercussions, this will let you sleep better.

Keep in mind your not oe shouldn't be liable of any ilegal actions without your knowledge. I could hack you, install a RAT or make you member of a Botnet for DDOS attacks on companies, etc and it wouldn't be fair to say you were the culprit of that attack. You where just a middleman and victim.

They need to provide digital evidence that you where on purpose part of said Ilegal activity. Running a VPN node on your home is not Ilegal. But ISP don't like it in some and Germany law does not comply well with this situations. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/i420mcl/  I love how your reddit profile says ""open for a respectful debate."" and then proceed to insult.

I do pay attention. Thats why Im a Mysterium ambassador, project is Beta since **""beta launch of Mysterium mainnet  — 10/30/2021**"".

Project is evolving and efforts are being done. I'm not sure what truth are you talking, really, I don't. Communication is also improving and marketing as well. Bitdegree program, Ambassador program, etc. If you truly support the project, get involved and try to make it better from within. Enough said.

I guess we are all moon boys right? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/i42tr0d/  What country do you live in? You should ask your ISP....but even if they don't like it, unless they state otherwise on their terms of service and usage you are ALLOWED.

Best way is asking the ISP itself. Or trying to check law in your country. My bet is that if you live in EU and not in Germany, you won't have any issue. Most cases they well send you a warning if they don't like it. Then you can cease actitivity or change ISP. If not, you can keep running it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/i421um1/  If you have the whitelisted option in the USA it shouldn't be a problem. Of course they wouldn't want their clients to run a VPN service, but is up to you to decide what to do with your internet.

If you want to run it with that feature disabled, then I would recommend talking with your ISP since you might get some emails whenever someone downloads a torrent or even ban you from using their ISP. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/i42fldd/  Yeah, they can but they should inform you first beforehand taking any actions. Usually, you get an email or letter saying hey, we detected this please stop or we will disable your Internet.

As long as you have whitelisting enabled on USA you shouldn't have a problem. Anyway, Im a Mysterium Ambassador. I reached out to one of my mates in USA. Hopefully, he can give you some insight. He has been running it for months with seeding torrents disabled and had no issue so far.

https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u00alh/concerned\_about\_someone\_torrenting\_on\_your\_node/ ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tzvkzo/how_safe_is_being_a_node_runner_for_me/i42swrf/  Hi.

Thats totally normal. I host 2 nodes on OCI Amsterdam and have the same issue. 

The test function I believe it's linked to the ""test button"" in https://mystnodes.com/ on your nodes section. So that when you click test on that mentioned wepage, it tries to access you node IP on port 4449 on your network (since most use cases are residential, so node would be on the same LAN as you are) but this is not the case for Cloud hosting. Since OCI nodes are not on your home network. Hence the result reports back test failed on node.

Don't worry, it should still work....now I'm not sure how this affects the quality scoring for your Node....that's something might be worth asking to devs.

Now, I just wanted to mention I have been running 2 nodes on OCI for 48 days and have not made 1Euro yet... so keep in mind that cloud hosting is not very rewarding...at least in Amsterdam.

For me those 2 nodes are testing grounds that I might migrate to somewhere else once I have another IP available. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tyxe8w/i_get_test_failed_when_hosted_on_oracle_oci/i3vk882/  Oh Japan! Nice, let me know if you get any profit eventually!!! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tyxe8w/i_get_test_failed_when_hosted_on_oracle_oci/i3vpfis/  Hahaha dont worry, I wasnt expecting any answer until maybe 2-3 months. That is if you still remember this conversation hahh. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tyxe8w/i_get_test_failed_when_hosted_on_oracle_oci/i3x4arz/  Yeah I agree, I had this issue with other projects and apps. Corruption after improper shutdown even affects disk image and stars in read only in Rpi. If this issue persists easier route might be to do a Data Migration and reinstall Mysterium and restore migrated Data. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twxs1k/get_an_error_when_trying_to_start_service/i3lw4zm/  Im sorry, but Im one of the users who also answered on that thread and mine (as well as others) didn't get their comments moderated. Users who got their comments deleted probably said something out of lines of this reddit..... ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3j9mor/  Well thats a bit odd....to be honest I don't see any content needed to be moderated if that was the case.

Maybe moderator mistake? Please keep in mind we are all humans after all. Mods make mistake, people in project make mistakes, project is still in Alpha and slowly growing. Mistakes are done, deadlines are being chased as good as possible, etc.

I love this project, not only because I think its  great idea and has a useful Use Case (which is what defines if a project dies or not in long term in the cripto world), but also because community is slowly growing and if you want you have the chance to contribute and impact greatly in this community.

Take care! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3lvujc/  There are lots of connections done by the test servers that test your Node. Those are in the Netherlands.

Now for regular consumption, I saw that my client based is mainly from all around Europe and North Africa. But the ones that pay and stay the most are the ones in Netherlands. I have a regular user from Netherlands that consumes monthly around 500GB.

I think he sends torrents or consumes Spains Netflix....whatever the case he ends up paying almost 20 Myst a month.

But you can check this and do an estimation here:

https://stats.mysterium.network/?orgId=1 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tvyveo/how_much_of_your_traffic_comes_from_the/i3lwhcn/  Nope. Thats something that always surprises me....My family lives in the USA and my brother always tells me how needs a VPN for most of stuff because their ISP spies on them.

In Spain your ISP might care about what you do, but their not allowed to spy their clients. So they are unable to block or do any penalties on their customers unless their actions means a disruption on the service for other customers.

I believed this is the case for most EU, but I've seen slowly that a lot of USA ""lack of ethics"" is being passed along to some EU countries as well.

Also keep in mind that tormenting is just a protocol, I could be torrenting an Ubuntu ISO image (which is totally legit) and still incur on ISP issues if I where to live in the USA. That's how stupid it is... ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tvyveo/how_much_of_your_traffic_comes_from_the/i3qfpi8/  You still have much to learn dear padwan:

There's an issue on the Polygon Network right now since yesterday night. It's under maintenance, just give it some time until it's fully back operational.

You can monitor this here https://status.mysterium.network/# ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tbnq7e/network_registration/i0873gb/  Hey!

SecOPS guy here, been on Infosec since 2012 and hacking, pentesting, etc. After reading this.... I have mixed feelings. I do agree with some of the points you posed, but I strongly disagree on the way you outlined them to be. You make them sound very hash, when there is justification to some of them. Let me explain:

* **2FA:** Yes this would be great, it should be an optional option on the UI. I encourage and use 2FA on all my services and even though I'd like this Mysterium UI, I will cut them some “slack” because in my years of working, I've seen many services enable 2FA after some time. Since this is a “new project”, hopefully they will integrate this on their pipeline sooner than later.
* **Documentation regarding ports:** I'd say documentation is pretty well done and strong point of this project. Ports are only 4449 and in most cases the rest is taken care by UPNP. If your router is not managing UPNP correctly then they state you will have to open ports UDP from range 10000-60000. [https://docs.mysterium.network/node-runners/troubleshooting/](https://docs.mysterium.network/node-runners/troubleshooting/) I disagree with this point. Of course, documentation can always be improved or better…but I don't think this is a weak point on this project.
* **Firewall**: This project is supposed to be mainly for residential users. How many run firewalls on their home? I didn't run onto any issue with ports on my 3 nodes setup. I have a strict firewall setup in router and I also run them on Oracle Cloud and my home. I only enabled 4449 port and 10000-60000 UDP for the NAT symmetric workaround. Oracle firewalls are pretty strict......and also they hardened their hosts which made me change IPtables definitions for those specific ports. But nothing else....at least for me.
* **HTTPS:** Yes, this one is my main concern as well. I will give you that. HTTPS is a must, even if inside my house. This needs to be somehow automated during install setup to use Letsencrypt or self signed.
* **Purchase of Myst Unsecured:** This is not true, they redirect you to another website portal to do the payment which is secured. Then Mysts are sent to your Node ID. That's it.
* **Regarding deb and Ubuntu:** Yes for enterprise, but this is solely focused for residential users which are more used to Ubuntu distros. Now ask yourself if you develop a product, what would you target first to get more potential customers on Linux world. Easy answer: Ubuntu. That doesn't mean, in the long term, they can't release a package for other distros. I'm also waiting for a Windows Server package that doesn't involve docker but Hyper-V. But again….it will probably come in the pipeline eventually as more users demand it.

&#x200B;

I really appreciate you taking the time to make this demands, thread and engaging in the community. It's like this how Mysterium will learn more about users concerns and demands. But I also wanted to shed some light on those points.

I don't believe them to be as bad as you make them sound like.

Cheers! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/hzyxyc3/  Yes it does, because your VPN encripts traffic. But if there is a MITM in your house or between a cloud hosted node, with no SSL encrypt, your pretty much doomed. HTTPS is an easy win they should enable. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/hzyy4ow/  I still stand on my points...

Yes, it would be nice to have a better network requirements section with the ports definitions better clarified for 4449. But I still think documentation is pretty neat, and I wouldn't dismiss this project upon such a small caveat.

When I mentioned firewalls, I mentioned both IPtables and Oracle (in my case) firewall and also router firewall (for the residential). I haven't had any problems...just opened TCP 4449 and UDP as mentioned. Maybe some dev can chip in and clarify this section since without debugging we relay on documentation and as mentioned before, it could be better explained on documentation, as you also pointed.

For the purchase and deb topics, I disagree. They don't even need to redirect you to your website UI, its just taking you there back after you finished the payment. They only need your **""Payment channel** and that you make the payment on the payment website which is secured.  They are not sending money or any data to your node through HTTP, this is pretty much done through blockchain to your ""Your Payment Channel"" which is the internal wallet of your node, which is used for withdrawals.

RPM and other releases will probably come sooner than later....I opened a issue on github regarding a windows server package with Hyper-V and a developer quickly answered me to help me with that and that he can create a package and then release it. I suggest you open an issue on github with that request.

Again, I believe project is great….devs are super willing and helpful. Good requests and demands are met if possible.

Some of your points are easily fixable or improvements. I wouldn't dismiss the project or call it “ridiculous” security, that's all I'm saying.

Cheers! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/hzzn1mh/  I have read your update and sorry I find it hard to connect the dots....Also I would appreciate that you take your toxicity and rudeness elsewhere when someone is trying to help and elaborate from a technical perspective.

But for the sake of anyone else reading, I will enlighten this topic:

Foremost, I do know how CC payments work, but you're mixing traditional payments with blockchain mechanics. Listen carefully and try to be logic about it:

1. Node opens HTTPS encrypted POP-UP where payment is done.
2. The only information provided to the POP-UP from your node (that since is in HTTP is unencrypted) would be your internal node wallet called ""payment gateway"", so that during the payment process they know who they should TOP UP.
3. That ""payment gateway"" or ""internal wallet address"" after payment is done, is being TOP-UP. This is done through a crypto exchange, where you send money from your bank account and the exchange sends your crypto to your “internal wallet address”.
4. Last part answers your ***""How else would the merchant know if the payment was successful or not?"" .*** Easy, it doesn't happen, pop-up closes, transaction from bank was done, but you have no way to know if this TOP-UP happened until all nodes in blockchain ""validate"" your transaction and that money appears on your wallet. Thats why since the Polygon network maintenance yesterday, no one is getting the Myst tokens during TOP-UP.

I suggest you check some infographics on how ""crypto exchange works"", there are some google images that clarify this process.

Now, related to your CC issue...I find it hard to believe it has anything to do with Mysterium. Only possibilities are:

1. Exchange gateway has had a leak.
2. Some other websites that you used and have your CC details have been leaked
3. You have been skimmed somewhere elsewhere....
4. You might have some keylogger installed.

In any case, none related to Myst itself, since Mysterium do not work with your CC details.

I still find hard to understand how you can believe the node has anything with the payment......it's opening a new pop-up. No personal details are on your node! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/i098fdw/  Have you opened those ports and port forwarded them to the internal IP of your Node?

I think that’s what I’d like to do anyways so I can work to pay off some of my debt first before going into an internship program.

iartpussyfart,"There are european vet schools that teach in english and are considerably cheaper (we're talking total tuition well under 100k!). I know of a few canadians studying in Europe. Worth looking into!I imagine it's free for citizens of the country but would cost for foreign students? That's how it works in other countries.. ie. at least I think Finland, Estonia etc.In case this info is useful for you.

Here's a copy paste of part of a previous comment I made on someone else's vet school related post.

""European schools tend to have more affordable tuition rates but the vet med curriculum is 6 years in some countries (as opposed to 4 like in the US). But they also don't all even require undergraduate degrees nor previous experience to apply, though those things do increase chances of acceptance.  
European vet schools should be EAEVE (European Association of Establishments for Veterinary Education) accredited but may not be AVMA (American Veterinary Medical Association) accredited. However, this doesn't mean that she couldn't practice as a vet in the US one day. She would just need to complete a certification program for foreign veterinary graduates and maybe sit the NAVLE (but I'm not familiar with all details). You can find out more at the AVMA's Educational Commission for Foreign Veterinary Graduates (ECFVG) webpage. [https://www.avma.org/education/ecfvg](https://www.avma.org/education/ecfvg)""

But I also learned there's another path to getting foreign graduate credentials recognized called the PAVE program (Program for the Assessment of Veterinary Education Equivalence).Yeah, absolutely they'll cost something and take time. But if the other option is that a person can't afford to ever become a vet due to the crippling debt they'd incur, then maybe it's a still a trade-off someone is willing to do to achieve their goals.I know at least 2 vets who's primary focus is surgery (one is soft tissue, the other ortho). However, they each tend to have maybe 1 day each week when they do appointments which are specifically for potential surgical candidates or follow-up appointments/post surgery rechecks for patients they have previously operated on. This is in Europe however, so it may differ from elsewhere.That sounds really disheartening. I know folks who got in on their first try with no previous animal experience nor relevant previous degrees, but the difference here is country of application. Everyone I know went to mainland European countries.

Has she considered applying to English language vet med programs offered by European veterinary schools? 

Especially since you're based in the UK, it wouldn't be that big a leap to move to mainland Europe for the duration of school. I believe the following countries have vet med programs taught in english: Poland, Hungary, Germany, Estonia, Czech Republic, Cyprus, Romania. Maybe some other countries too.

tdoodles97,"This is the first post in a long time that has me worried. I was just accepted to a number of veterinary schools in the US & UK, and will begin August 2024. After narrowing down COL, program, affordability of travel, reputation, and much more, I have been deciding on what school I ultimately choose to attend based on tuition amount. But now, I worry, what if the more expensive schools have a more well-rounded curriculum? 

OP, can you please share what vet school you went to?  

And anyone else who sees this, 
What would you choose? UC Davis or North Carolina State?They won’t convert you into a VA, many CSCs stay in their role for years. 

That being said, I started as a CSC without knowing I wanted to be in vet med. Then I discovered I loved it, so I looked for a job that would train me as an assistant at another GP. I later worked in ER, ICU, in orthopedics, and more. 

I just actively pursued it, and *8 years later I’m currently deciding between several vet schools I’ve been accepted to!What school are you at?Ahhh, I applied there this cycle as an OOS student and am waiting to hear back! Other than finals week being brutal, how have you liked your experience so far?None of those are AVMA accredited though, and if OP and his wife want to come back to the US where she can work as a vet, it’ll be miserable trying to even become eligible to sit for the NAVLE to become a licensed vet in the US. They’ll be working for years as an assistant despite graduating from any of those schools in Europe because AVMA accreditation. 

Some of the best vets I know went to non-AVMA vet schools, so it’s not that the educational quality is any less. But it’s been made abundantly clear how hard it is to become a US licensed vet if someone goes that route instead. 

Side note I have no fricking clue why OP’s wife didn’t get any interview offers. The whole picture isn’t being shown. Maybe her essays are bad or the application is riddled with typos. I’m a first time applicant with similar work history (better GPA but still that’s not the only thing that matters) and I received interviews this cycle from Davis, RVC, & Glasgow, and have received no rejections at all, just waiting to hear from all the others still","Veterinarian.

The-Ascendancy,"Quick question: would euthanizing a healthy animal because their owner is moving and can't/won't take the animal with them be legal where you practice (I'm assuming the US?)? Doing that here in Germany can cost you your license and even land you in prison. It's a straight up felony.Shelters here cannot euthanize animals just to make more space. But between the shelters themselves and foster homes, there seems to always be a place for pets that cannot stay with their owner. Not sure why it works here but doesn't elsewhere.

Justifiable reasons for euthanasia aren't listed anywhere in our laws, but courts have set precedents on what qualifies as such a reason. One example for the fine line between justified and illegal: an aggressive dog that has bitten people in the past and does not respond to behavioral therapy can be put down, but there has been an instance in which a vet euthanized such a dog based on the dog's family's testimony alone. A court then ruled that the vet did not conduct a medical exam and therefore couldn't rule out a medical reason for the dog's behavior that might have been treatable. She kept her license and just needed to pay a fine AFAIK, but the euthanasia clearly was ruled illegal.","Veterinarian.

rjsevin,"Just because you need a vet in a rural area doesn't mean that graduating additional students will get one there. Rural jobs are not desirable. The salaries are lower, the hours are usually longer and harder as they are typically large animal with lots of on call hours, the areas you are forced to live in to accommodate the job are not great for young professionals looking to maybe find a life partner and, if they desire, raise a family...

I'm not saying one way or another about if more schools are needed, I don't have an educated opinion, but I don't necessarily see more graduates as an effective way to get people to rural locations.I also work for the feds after being in small animal private practice for 6 years. The change has been nothing but a breath for fresh air and I'm really thriving in the new position. A couple years in and I'm still loving it.Without an MPH (I don't have any advanced degrees besides my DVM) you're going to be looking at GS-11/12 positions, which are basically entry level DVM positions. As far as I know, most departments that hire vets are basically running on fumes and desperate for applicants.

Mostly, my advice if you want a fed job is be willing to move and be willing to take a pay cut. Unless you already live near a work hub you're going to have to move. And the pay cut... If you learn your job and work hard, there are lots of opportunities for promotions. Less than 18 months after starting I was promoted to a GS-13 position, which is closer to a reasonable private practice salary in my area.

lexguru86,"As an owner (non-vet) partner/owner of an internal medicine clinic I can tell you this - don't be so worried. We have an internal med vet and vet pharmacist in house and the amount of things I learn from them almost makes me feel like I truly know what's going on with the patient. You having actual experience, and education and have demonstrated the ability to understand means you'll prevail even in the most uncomfortable situations you're in.

Our docs are great at explaining and love to explain/teach/discuss what they are doing, so find one like this at first (if you can). It will make you feel so much better about everything.  This is something I haven't seen in other medical professions I'm invested in.

Trust me, I have a huge capability to understand things, hence why I invest in multiple business outlets confidently (I have to hedge my risks), but by far out of all of the investments I've made, the docs here are literally explaining things so well that I'm actually learning for fun lol.

My point is, I'd hire a vet off the street if I knew they'd be receptive and capable of understanding what's going on with a patient.

Rusty_Meta1,"I just took NAVLE this fall window... one thing that helped me feel more prepared (you never feel 100% I have found) was making charts. I downloaded the ICVA species and diagnosis doc (google it) and made a chart out of every disease on there. clinical signs, Dx, Tx, Etc (a section for whatever extra tidbits I wanted to fill in, usually Px or something relevant). I put everything from vet prep and zuku on it and then went behind and filled out the rest. 

It wasn't complete but there are like a thousand conditions on that doc so I did my best lol. I could fill out about 5 diseases a day max after rotations. Since you are taking it so soon, maybe just use that doc to fine-tune your reading after you hit all the vet prep pages.I will add that there are some rescue organizations or humane societies that have spay/neuter vets that do those primarily all day long. They will occasionally do other surgeries for the rescue animals but the main thing is several dozen spay/neuters a day at a low rate.US 4th year vet student here, so I'm not sure if these will apply to you. If available, my number one pick would be VIN! It is amazing, and full of tons of different resources. Plumbs drug formulary online is growing into something big but its still in the growth phase and not really worth the cost of the higher level subscription imo, but the basic version for just drugs is good and they keep it very up to date.I agree. If this is a corporate clinic, try to climb the ladder a little higher with the issue until you see some results. If not then go to the highest person there, lead DVM, owner, etc. If the conventional avenue of going to the manager isn't working then go as high as you can get. 

Also, DOCUMENT EVERYTHING. If push comes to shove, a long paper trail with time stamps is the only definitive proof you really have. Don't let trusting your other co-workers word be the only evidence you have if you pursue this very far.Emails are usually the easiest: “just following up on what we spoke about” or similar if you’re bringing up issues face to face. 
But that may not be as low key at your practice if emails aren’t often used for work related stuff. In that case maybe document your complaints after bringing things up to give them with dates and then make copies to keep. When handing them in “hey just wanted to give this official complain in writing too”. 
That type of stuffCheck with the previous year's class (or your current classmates) for some hand-me-down notes/materials. There are a ton of PDF files on those sites and you're not supposed to share them but... the struggle is real.

Also worth noting is that usually in January both of those have a 'sale' so the amount of days you purchase for them extends until after the November/December window, if you're going to dish out the cash then it's better to do that. Zuku (and I think vet prep too) does question-of-the-day emails for free so you can sign up for those but you're only gonna get a hundred or so questions total by the April window. You can also poke around online, some schools have NAVLE-style questions on their websites. 

The biggest benefit of those sites is the ability to get questions with good feedback. So it really is worth buying one. You can gimmick the materials they provide but there's not much to replace the thousands of practice questions they have. 

Also, take ICVA practice tests to know where you stand. There are 3 of them, only one allows you to see which questions you got wrong, and the others just give a score. They also cost some but are SO worth it, they project what you might make on the NAVLE and can tell you where you are weak/strong.Skechers arch fit!!   
I have tried brooks and other 'nursing/active' shoes but those take what seems like *forever* to break in. I just bought my 3rd pair of these Skechers and still love them!   
Before those, I got some arch support insoles that worked pretty well. Arch support is like required for the vet world imo.A Vet is a Veterinarian, who holds a Doctor degree in veterinary medicine. A 'vet tech' is a veterinary technician, there are two common types, licensed and unlicensed. Licensed 'vet techs' have gone to a veterinary technician school, have taken an exam, and passed, they are equivalent to being a registered nurse in the vet world. Depending on the state and hospital, unlicensed 'techs' are trained on the job and may have little to no educational training at all, it's just a title to show seniority; some states or practices won't allow someone who has not been licensed to have the 'veterinary technician' title. Unlicensed vet techs are actually vet assistants but that title (in my and most people's opinion) feels too low for all they do; after all, they are not the type of assistant you see on TV who just gets coffee.

In the US, Veterinarians go to Vet school for 4 years only AFTER completing a bachelor's degree for 4 years; I know some countries have 6-year programs you can directly enter after high school (or equivalent). Depending on the country and the type of vet school you go to (6 year vs others) the AVMA may or may not allow you to sit for the North American Veterinary Licensing Exam (NAVLE). This is the big exam that allows you to practice in the US. I know some countries are can take another exam (the Program for the Assessment of Veterinary Equivalence PAVE), complete a clinical year in the US, and then take the NAVLE.

Go online to AVMA's website and I think you should find info relevant to your situation there, or be able to contact someone who knows more! I hope this helps!Someone already said it, but you have to already have the Doctor degree or equivalent (or about to receive it in the final year as a student) before you can take the NAVLE. You can graduate and have the Doctor title but you can't practice medicine without taking the NAVLE. You could teach, work in research, or similar things without passing the NAVLE but you can't see patients or do medicine without the NAVLE.

The NAVLE is only for Doctors. Licensed Vet techs take a different exam called the VTNE.Sorry this ended up being very lengthy!

1. while you are in high school do well enough to get accepted into a decent university and have an overall good GPA to help with this. A lot of universities offer different pre-veterinary degrees that you should go for. These (in theory) will make sure you get all of the required classes to apply to vet school. Make sure to take a ton of science classes and make sure to do really really well in them. Take as many credit hours (classes) as you are allowed. Vet schools want to see that you do really good in science, and that you can handle 6/7+ classes a semester, because that is what you will be doing if you get accepted. 
2. We are all burnt out and struggling mentally, but it is otherwise very rewarding. Take an interest in mental health and caring for your own mental well-being, you will have to do that a lot, especially in vet school. it is also worth noting that the vet world seems to be looking up. the older vets are all still depressed and struggling, but the new generation doesn't seem to be as bad (or maybe that is my experience)
3. to put some big scary numbers to it: the AVMA (American veterinary medical association) releases statistics yearly about the state of Vet Med. This year average student debt for vet school alone was $145,000. Starting Salaries were around 115,000/year for new grads. These are very subjective depending on where you go and other things, but these numbers are looking better than they did in the past. Also keep in mind that there is not a ton of upward movement to salaries over time, or there hasn't been in the past. Offset your tuition cost by going to an in-state school (the vet school in the state you live in, or a vet school that contracts with your state to provide in-state tuition to a certain number of students form your school), living modestly and not paying the highest rent around, scholarships, savings, dont take any grad plus loans, etc. 
4. some schools do track for large animal or small animal vets, but the NAVLE (licensing exam) is over everything and majority small animal, so most teach everything and you can go into one vs the other later. Also salaries for large animal vets are much lower than small animal vets.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment contains information from both medical and veterinary fields.

student_of_theGame,"No, you can fire a client and it’s usually best if you have documented evidence of instances that are of high severity or high frequency. Typically, you’d send a letter to the client along with copies of the pets medical record. So that they have no reason to return. 

If your hospital has access to a lawyer or lawyer services, they’d be able to draft up a client fire letter which would state specific instances as to the reason and would provide the client with the location of another hospital that they can visit. 

Hope this helps!Another feature that most veterinary PMS completely ignore is controlled drug logging. It can definitely be part of the PMS and there are a few companies out there that focus on digital record keeping. 

Another pain point for vets is in states with a prescription monitoring program (PMP) employees have to submit controlled drug dispensation information manually. Controlled drugs that are dispensed from the hospital must be reported to the state. Human systems have a built in feature that allows the data to be sent to the state automatically(via a txt file organized in ASAP format). I believe only one veterinary PMS has that functionality. What we’re left with is techs or managers entering drug dispensation data into a portal to send to the state. This is super time consuming and a solution would save tons of time.","Veterinarian.

Upbeat_Intention2843,"Weirdest question on pre paying for vet school.

Pirate_the_Cat,"Thank you for saying this. A few kind words can go a long way.Surgery residency is super competitive. Many of my friends that are going or have gone that track have had to do a rotating and two specialty internships prior to residency. Some I know have done 3 surgery internships. You’re not gonna find a residency that will take you without rotating and surgery internships.I have to disagree. There are plenty of pets out there that need homes. Just because someone can’t sink $10k into an emergency doesn’t mean it’s convenient.I also went through two cycles and got in via wait list on the second go. While it wasn’t great for my self-esteem, I’m now in a great job. 

During my interim period, I picked up some opportunities in shelter med and at an ER as I’d had some SA GP experience already. I was so desperate for experience there was one point I was driving an hour and a half each way with no pay for experience at a SA/mixed practice, I think that was a good talking point during my interviews. 

I think having a variety in experiences is good, any experience counts. Picking up some SA experience doesn’t mean you have to stick with that road forever. Plus maybe you’ll like it more than you think. You can also tell the board that you’re interested in equine medicine but keeping an open mind barring the unique experiences you’ll get in school. 

I assume you’ve reached out to your personal equine vet? Have you reached out to the equine and food animal departments at your in-state vet school? You may be able to find some opportunity there, or at least pass along some contact info for you to probe.Link to post?Interventional radiology is a niche area and is typically reserved for internal medicine specialists. Radiation therapy is in the oncology realm, I don’t know much about the logistics of it tbh. Both of these require a very well-equipped facility that a lot of specialty hospitals don’t have, so if you were specifically seeking one of those then your options for jobs may be a bit limited. 

Diagnostic radiology has a more broad scope and is needed everywhere. Still requires specializing. 

All of these require vet school following an undergrad degree, at least one if not two internships, followed by a 3-year residency. If you’re looking for money, you’re looking in the wrong place. Vet school can cost 25-50k a year on average. Internships and residencies don’t pay much and the hours suck. That means 8-9 years after college before you see a decent salary and most vets come out with about 200k in debt after school. You’re likely going to get burnt out and if you don’t have a passion for reaching that end, I don’t see why you’d do it.

ETA: I didn’t even go into how competitive radiology is in terms of residency as well as passing boards. It is one of the more competitive areas of vet med from my understanding. Regardless, any residency is competitive, and passing boards is difficult in any area of specialty.Are they the ones that do the procedures involving fluoro? Ive seen radiologists be involved in managing the imaging side of things, but it was ultimately an internist performing many of the procedures. I guess there’s overlap there.

In Mexico (where I'm from), there is an oversaturation of small animal clinics and hospitals in the cities, but most of them offer poor benefits and salaries, and starting your own clinic is not that easy.

Wish you the best in your new job!I'm from Mexico and going to take the NAVLE in November/ December window. I just read a bit about Vetco, and opinions seem to be mostly similarOh, thank you! I'm going to take a lookThat's correct. I'm Mexican and studied at FMVZ-UNAM. I had some schoolmates from the US and other countries, and I believe the tuition per year for foreigners is around US$1k, with living costs ranging from US$350+ per month, depending on your personal needs. They also mentioned that it was quicker since we can start right after high school without needing to go to college first. It's a 5-year program plus 6 months for social service, and the time it takes to complete your project degree (around 6-6.5 years in total).

I would like to hear about your personal experiences with the requirements and the cost of university. It would be very interesting considering that these are very different situations, especially for Mexicans who study at UNAM, where tuition fees are very low due to being subsidized by taxes (which is why the acceptance rate to this university is extremely low and it has around 250k students in different majors and campuses). It's crazy that with 1 US dollar, we could cover the tuition fees for the 5 years of veterinary school for 243 students (25 peso cents per year per student).

I'm planning to take the NAVLE next year.Do you already pass the NAVLE?
I know some companies working with Mexico to bring vets to the states; maybe you can find something similar for the UK.

TORMAYGEI,"Oof…sounds like there might multiple levels to this. My biggest question is how are you presenting yourself at work? Yes internally you may be researching stuff and finishing surgeries in a timely manner, etc. and feeling good about it but are you presenting it in a confident (not cocky) way? Or are you presenting yourself in a more hesitant, questionable way? That way be WHY there’s such a difference between the way you and your colleague are being treated.

However, I will say, the comments you are getting from your techs ARE rude.

-spython-,"I went to uni in the UK where they teach flank in lectures, but did all my EMS in the USA/Canada so all my practical training was in the midline approach. I've only ever done midline in practice, but everywhere I've worked I'm usually the only vet using the midline approach in cat spays. 

I've also only ever seen other vets do a pre-scrotal approach to dog castrates in the UK (and that's what I was taught in uni), but I learned both pre-scrotal and scrotal techniques in the US. There does seem to be a strong regional influence to the surgical techniques taught to veterinarians.I learned the autoligation technique for cat spays at Humane Alliance - it's straightforward and secure once you get the hang of it!You would need a qualified vet registered with the RCVS to carry out home palliative care and euthanasia. Vet nurses are able to administer treatments prescribed by a veterinary surgeon under their direction, but they are not permitted to diagnose, recommend treatments, or prescribe. 

There are already many UK companies that offer these services, including Cloud 9 Vets who are nation-wide, and various mobile vets who cover smaller areas. Many vets are attracted to mobile vet practice, including palliative and end of life care, because they enjoy the longer appointment times, better flexibility and work life balance, and being able to support pets and guardians through this emotional and difficult time.Most of the UK schools have a large graduate-entry program tailored to American applicants. I went to Edinburgh, and I would guess that nearly half my year were from abroad. We also had many mature students, including some people in their 40s.

I'm not sure why your wife is struggling so much with the admin process, on paper she is more than qualified. Is she getting to the interview stage?

mamabird228,"I have a client that is elderly and tries her best with the Tom cat that she invited into her home after years on the streets. He’s huge and tough in regards to his nails (but sweet as absolute pie if you don’t touch his paws) bc he was alone outside for 7 years with nobody to condition him or love him enough to provide necessary maintenance. His extra toes were always very very painful and cats obvs develop arthritis in their feet first. Even giving him gaba to bring him to vet visits was hard for this owner. My vets removed the extra toes for a very reduced price since they kept getting infected. She is not a piece of shit owner. He is much happier now. I think this view sucks, personally.Designating clients as pieces of shit for struggling to do things that we may deem easy is not what we are in this line of work for. Those nails do not get filed down with regular scratching. It does take maintenance work which some people just aren’t able to do because they have lives and families and kids and jobs and whatever else. Cats aren’t ever typically super complaint with nail trims either. So labeling them as a POS for struggling to handle a genetic defect, in any aspect but coming to us for help/a solution is really off putting to me.Unfortunately PR is not title protected so that’s why the pay is such shit even if you are licensed :( I make over $40/hr as a licensed tech in California. It’s taken me several years to get to that pay grade. I spent some time in specialty which added to my overall knowledge and now am working back in GP.I went and got myself human CPR certified bc I have a small child at home. Animal CPR and human CPR are similar but not exactly. It’s a cheap class and a good thing to have just in case, imo.We always scan in the signed certificate into the system before letting the client leave with it. We will email it as many times as they want/need free of charge but some places get specific about wanting an original and for that, we will charge $5. It takes doctor time, CSR time, etc. We call it a convenience fee. We will not email vaccine records until a series has been completed. Owners are more than welcome to come pick those up free of charge but we have had an instance of someone forging their own (emailed) vaccine certificate to use for boarding at another facility.It’s really not a good corporation to work for but I suppose you can find that out on your own. You obviously don’t have experience since this is your first interview so just express your love of pets and willingness to learn.The active ingredient in rescue is (the same as accel) which is accelerated hydrogen peroxide. I’m guessing the solution that you’re making is much too strong but it’s not technically a “chemical” burn… I guess it could be since everything is a chemical but anyways you might be having sensitivity/bleaching from the peroxide. Rescue should be air dried after wiping down. If unable to air dry before people or animals come in contact with it, the area should be wiped with a wet cloth. You can read more about this here:

Bang130612tan,"I’ll try not to repeat what’s already been said. 

Don’t be afraid to ask questions. About medications, procedures, tests, diagnoses, what you’re seeing on a radiograph/ultrasound, etc. Some of my coworkers keep around a small notebook to write down things they might forget (such as what to ask while taking a history in a vaccine vs sick appointment). If you don’t get the chance to ask a question, look it up when you next get the chance (or write it down to ask later).

Also learn about the software that’s used for appointments ASAP. Learn how to make appointments, where to access patient history, and how to make estimates and invoices. 

Good luck!I’m sorry, but they have someone that has only been working for 2 months to be the sole assistant during the weekend?? And in surgery no less??? 

I work in surgery as an assistant and I genuinely cannot wrap my head around this. We’re considered short staffed if we only have two of us in surgery that day. And that’s for one doctor.

RedundantMarsupial,"Hi! Not a vet, but have worked in both commercial and teaching farms for vet schools, small animal GP, and research models, which all required euthanasia in some capacity.

As for facing it throughout your veterinary career: it depends what you want to go into. During vet school, you will do euthanasias, learn about them, etc. If you plan on going into small animal, sedation before pushing euthanasia solution is common for a “traditional death”. If you love food animal/population medicine, it is quite different from euthanasia in GP. Even on teaching farms we use euthanasia solution but I have never euthanized this way in a commercial unit. If this is what you want to do, it may be hard to cope with euths. 

Coming from someone who used to cry and faint when I had to collect tissue samples from mice, let alone euthanize them, you do get a bit desensitized, to be frank. I call it exposure therapy, but the more you see the better it will sit with you. Most vet schools (at least that I’ve known) also have therapists and outreach for students/staff, which may be beneficial to you.

Rumentacular,"Not sure why you got downvoted this is the correct answer.What do you mean by the gabapentin comment? More options for pain management? If you’re concerned about options for dogs you must be thoroughly depressed by the feline options.What allows papers to gain traction is whether they are done properly and the results are repeatable. 

Anectodal evidence is bottom of the barrel, if you or others want to rely on it in the face of contradictory research that has gone through the process of study design, review, analysis, publication, etc you can. If you want to criticize the study design, conclusion, parameters, etc that is reasonable but simply saying that a person’s anecdotal evidence is enough to disregard peer review and in many cases placebo control double blinded evidence is not consistent with being evidence based. While some may be content not being evidence based in their decisions I think that brings you closer to the shamans, voodoo, thoughts and prayers, BS that we should be avoiding.At least you admit the bias. Our goal should be understanding our biases and being conscious of how they are guiding our choices. 

Your example has a pretty clear explanation. The vast majority of acute diarrhea resolves on its own without any intervention, therefore if metro is routine prescribed then the vast majority of cases get better but not BECAUSE of metro. 

The change to bland diets and probiotics doesn’t have an inherently lower chance of resolution (in fact studies suggest otherwise) but it does have the downside of the owners and practitioners knowing there is the possibility of metro. My bias and hypothesis is that when owners are given a medication for a symptom they are far more willing to continue it for the course of the prescription before returning(7-10 days for metro do instance) compared to diet and probiotic change people call in 2 days saying diarrhea is still going on and they want something else. When we then give them metro we see resolution not because of the drug but because of the time. 

I’m guilty of treating the owner more than the pet similar to the example you mention, but the change in mind frame of the practitioner needs to be clear. Metro isn’t being prescribed because it’ll work better or faster in those cases(there is no evidence to support that assumption), it is being given to assuage the owner and prevent them from being a nuisance by giving them something to do for a predetermined length of time. When you think about it in that way you realize that it is an intellectually and ethically flawed decision.I mean dogs can still get buprenorphine it’s just expensive. Tylenol alone is just so-so but Tylenol with codeine is an option. A recent neurology CE I went to recommended codeine for neck and back pain. I’ve used it a handful of times and been content. Also I feel like we’re a bit too hesitant with NSAIDs in general, I’d suggest that if pain management is truly a concern, the small risk of the NSAID is worth it. What circumstances are you referring to, acute pain, chronic pain. I’ve personally never heard another vet suggest the pain control options for dogs was a limiting factor in their practice.To be honest at least you’re engaging with the issue. I wish more vets realized they weren’t cut out to be a doctor.Makes perfect sense, I think I was assuming more chronic or like lameness related pain. 

I’d suggest that if data is scant or low effect (ie for acetaminophen or gabapentin) this doesn’t always mean that when part of a multi-modal plan they aren’t additive or synergistic. 

Even as a lowly GP, I don’t blame you wanting to minimize the risk of a GP screwing up your emergency surgery.

Here are human guidelines FWIW. 
https://wjes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13017-022-00455-7

For better or worse it’s important to know that whatever temporary pain is present is infinitely preferable to death so you have that in your favor.

pwny__express,"Yeah this is an issue everywhere I've worked. Even if the majority of rDVMs do everything they're asked to, the handful that don't, really stand out. 

Sorry in advance, this meme triggered me, so vent following: 

It represents a more general breakdown of the old-school dynamic between ECC DVMs and rDVMs (in my view); COVID and post-COVID changes in our profession further strained this relationship.

The established dogma essentially works like this: rDVM referral => speciality emergency care => return to rDVM for follow-up ; always with the inherent and assumed professional collegiality (ie. communication) necessary to ensure the patient is receiving the appropriate care - before, during, and after a visit to emergency & critical care. This (in theory) allows for continuity of care and a cyclic, self-referring economic practice that preserves the rDVM-client relationship and preserves the rDVM-ECC DVM relationship.

This is how it should work in practice, but the realities of veterinary medicine in the last 4-5 years has shown erosion of the conventions and practical applications of this system. This system really only works for our patients when everyone (rDVM, ECC DVM) is equally invested in the pet's outcome. For example: 

- if an rDVM evaluates a sick patient and then transfers with no call, no records, and no conversation with an owner - they're essentially both delegating their job to me, and simultaneously making my job harder. In 2 years I've had 10-12 cases where owners arrive clueless to how sick their pet is and clueless to the costs for 2 or 3 days of ICU care, and they've ultimately elected for humane euthanasia after a 5-10 minute conversation. The rDVM also charged the owner a consultation fee, which seems like it should've covered that same conversation. 
- location dependent, but where I am, rDVMs are rarely available for the follow-up necessary to recheck *their own patients*. Discharging a patient from the ICU means they are well enough to go home, not necessarily that they're healthy. Most of these patients need a follow-up within 7-10 days (if not sooner) and rDVMs often seem to struggle getting appointments within 3-4 weeks. Patients requiring open-wound management are a great example - they require bandage changes every 1-3 days, often times for weeks at a time. Emergency & critical care can happily put these animals back together on day 1. But ECC, by definition, doesn't see appointments, we are not meant to be there for the scheduled follow-up care, and it's inappropriate to presume that we are now the animals' primary doctor. Of course, we're often the only choice, so my days commonly involve seeing all the new patients coming in off the street, all the patients being transferred from the rDVM, and sprinkling in the 'recheck appointments' that our patients need. rDVMs should have a very clear understanding of how difficult it is to arrange an appointment in the middle of a schedule that is by default, unpredictable. Is this not the same problem facing our counterparts in human medicine that are overwhelmed with people relying on the ER as their primary care? 

Recognizing a minority of bad apples don't represent the majority of rDVMs - if the perception is rDVMs are not fulfilling their role prior to transfer and after discharge, it makes it really hard to want to play along and coddle the precious rDVM-client relationship, much less maintain any collegial rDVM-ECC DVM relationship. 

- it sometimes feels as if the primary motivation for the rDVM not the outcome for the patient, but rather preserving a VCPR with the client (ie. preserving opportunity for income). Because I actually don't care if the client returns to the rDVM; my motivation is for the best outcome for my patient
- what reason do I have to go out of my way to maintain collegial rDVM relationships, when this is how ECC is treated? I mean, I do anyway, but I'm salty about it. There is no longer an economic motivation to maintain these relationships; in many areas one ECC clinic is the *only choice* - so I'm going to see the ECC patients whether I want to or not, and rDVMs are going to continue referring sick animals to ECC, because they don't have a choice. Alternatively, I welcome rDVMs to feel free to begin treating and working these patients up on their own.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

You can even ask them “Do I actively disrespect you in the workplace? No, so I would appreciate it if you don’t actively disrespect me. Thank you.”Definitely focus on maintaining your mental health. Vet school is a lot of work, but it doesn’t have to be hellish. I spend most evenings reading, writing, and watching YouTube videos, and only really study the weekend before exams, and I still get above average grades. Some days it feels like I’ll never get off the struggle bus, but others I feel like I’m winning at life. Just take it all as it comes, relax, don’t waste hours and hours trying to get those extra couple of percentage points, and try to have as much fun as you can :)1 big one tomorrow (152 questions, I’m so excited)I honestly don’t know… half of it is material from the past two and a half weeks, so I’m just reviewing that as I usually do, and the rest is cumulative from the past 8 weeks. I’m really hoping I remember enough of that material to make some solid guesses, because I don’t have time to study it all....I'm just curious, but why do you want to be a vet if you don't like medicine? 

If you just want to work with animals, there are plenty of other related careers, from zookeeper to working in an animal shelter to working for an animal welfare organization etc.I mean, there's general information available on youtube (and plenty of more specific videos if you know what to look for), but if you're asking if you can basically get a veterinary education via the internet, I think you'll be disappointed","Other.

dascowsen,"I recommend figuring out the difference in cost for in state vs island schools, and then compare this difference to your expected annual salary. Depending on the cost difference (include flights, living estimate), sometimes it's worth it to wait a year, get more experience, do research, etc to make you a better candidate. If however, the difference in cost is equal to or close to one years wage, then  it's worth it to pay the extra cost to start working sooner. 

Look at the acceptance stats of in state schools and see where you fall. If you're not even close to the lower end of the admitted GPA, save yourself application fees and go to island schools. 

You don't have to be overly precise, but I know of students that did not get in after 1 attempt in Canada and regret not trying again because they owe 10x more and in USD (so add 40% for conversion).Keep in mind, if they infrequently hire new vets they may need to consult lawyers etc to write the contract. Compare this to corporations that have these ready to go because they hire a lot of vets, frequently. However, if they are not keeping you updated or unresponsive give this a flag. I agree with the previous post about being transparent and explaining you have other offers but they are your first choice. Be respectful, ensure it doesn't sound like an implicit threat.","Veterinarian.

It’s natural to make mistakes. Enjoy every minute of it! I just got accepted to vet school and I think I’m gonna miss it quite a bit. I’m writing this on my break at my own assistant job actually, haha. About to go do some treatments on a horse and goat! Are you in large or small animal?Nice! I used to work in small animal and it was a blast, I learned so much. Enjoy <3I spent my entire life wanting to be a vet and had the exact same worries once I got my start in the field. I started working at a small animal vet hospital, being the only assistant on a very small staff with one vet, and I cried and cried after every euthanasia. As I matured and grew into the field, I realized that veterinary medicine is absolutely beautiful, and awesome, and hard, and so special, and it has so many different avenues. So if you do decide to enter vet med, that could mean becoming a vet, or maybe specializing, or being a tech, or traveling, or whatever! It’s so versatile, and that’s another reason why I love it. Every time I get to go to work and sit with a horse while it heals, or walk up to a previously very sick dog’s cage with its tail wagging like crazy, I am reminded that little me knew what she was doing! And now I’ve applied to all the vet schools I could manage and I’m crossing my fingers harder than ever. It all about what you make of it, in my opinion. Explore!

Sociopathic_Elephant,"The good news is you're graduating from high school, so you have an immense amount of time to figure this out. You should look into finding a companion exotics and zoo vet to try and shadow to see what it's like. More good news is that education on proper care is probably 75% of what exotics vets have to do, because a majority of the health problems you see in those animals are due to improper care. 

That being said, zoo and exotics are one of the only specialties where you'll make less than if you had just gone in to dog and cat practice. Probably second only to equine and large animal medicine. And they take a lot of extra work in vet school and beyond to get into, so it truly needs to be your biggest passion.

amyamv13,"I was a tech for several years before vet school, now I’ll graduate vet school in a year! But one of the cases that always stuck in my heart was this sweet little cat. Her mom was the nicest person, and her poor kitty had Cytauxzoon felis. My personal cat came to the clinic to be her blood donor. Her mom was so kind and grateful. I let her come by over the weekend while I took care of boarders to spend time with her baby. 

Sadly her sweet kitty didn’t make it. But she made sure to tell us how much she appreciated the care we gave her. A few days later she brought me a gift bag with a hand written card, and toys to thank my kitty for his donation to try and save her. She got my cat a box of her kitty’s favorite treats too, which are now my cat’s favorite to this day. I’ll never forget herThat is awesome, we are getting so close!!I didn’t quite have a 4.0, but our stats were really similar. And I also had solid experience, LOR’s, and essays (I thought). And that happened to me too. I really did feel like shit! Actually I didn’t get in until my third try. Now I’m almost in my 4th year of vet school, so don’t give up! They say it’s because there’s just so many strong applicants, which is partially true. But honestly I think part of it is just roulette or them checking their boxes to have an inclusive class. 
Because once I got in I have many classmates that have ZERO vet experience or much lower GPA’s. At first it made me a little upset, like how did it take me this long? But we are all doing well, are just as committed, and deserve the chance. Admissions is just weird and don’t let it get you down for too long. 
Also looking back, I feel like I got in when I was supposed to, even though the rejection felt like shit at the time. I love the experience I got during my gap time, I ended up getting my Masters in Public Health too. I got to spend irreplaceable time with my family, which I appreciate so much now since my mom passed away right before starting vet school. I think it all happened how it was supposed to.

The practical concerns like money, in my opinion, do matter. But even if you consider another job, don't think that it has to be business or finance or something unrelated to your passions. Think about what you are actually interested in, and look at alternative careers related to that. Do you like medicine, biology, science in general?

Highly_Sugared,"Veterinary practice: How do I go about it?

Hi, my name is Leonardo, and my absolute dream job is to be a DVM. I've been doing a lot of research but I thought I'd ask first hand for some of my questions as it's a little difficult to find in things like articles. I am currently a freshman in highschool and have started animal science as my CTE. I assumed this would be the right path to go since it's focused mainly around veterinary practice. I live on a ranch with my family, which is mainly what aspired me to want to go into the veterinary feild; that and my compassion for animals in general.

1. My main struggle is college as I can't find any clear answers on how that works. It seems that it's all variables which I'm having a hard time comprehending. If someone could clearly explain that in a more step-by-step format it would probably help as most of the articals I read are very long-winded and hard to understand.

2. Anytime I try reading about the process of entering the veterinary feild it's almost discouraging as everything ends with 'It's not worth it'. All I hear about it how terrible the student loan debt is and that most vets live miserably. Is it not worth it to enter the veterinary feild?

3. Just how rough are the student loans and is there any way to dampen them even just a bit? I have a job working at one of my local restaurants that pays well enough for a minimum wage job and I plan on saving as much of that as I can for college. 

4. Is there a specific course you have to take for large animal veterinary medicine (cows, goats, horses, etc.) or is it also taught alongside small animal veterinary medicine? This one also confuses me because it seems there not exactly a clear answer here either.

Thanks in advance everyone !!!","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it expresses a clear intention to pursue a career as a",Veterinarian
Nitasha521,"Unsure if you are in the US, but i'll answer like you are.  I'd wonder if there are other code violations or OSHA violations going on if a gas leak persisted for days?  Could anonymously report to local labor office or local authorities/utility company, if you feel unsafe working in the current conditions.For some universities, if you are an employee of that university the cost of tuition hoes down a lot -- but this option takes a bit of work to become a TA or research assistant or such.

I don't know about Europe, but in the US there are programs you can get after vet school that allow loan forgiveness of certain amounts if working in underserved areas around the nation -- but this would mean moving somewhere specific for it, or even working in a specific sector of vet med after school (such choices may not work for everyone).  Would wonder if similar programs available in the EU.Each Dr may find a different flow that works for them.  Asking certain questions ahead of examination can be important (like does your pet have fear/anxiety/stress at the vet office, or does something hurt on the pet currently) since those might affect HOW you approach the patient.  

Otherwise, before exam i try to (1) introduce myself and create some point of connection with client immediately, (2) verify why pet came in today, (3) verify my understanding of current history taken by tech, and (4) signpost about how the appt is likely to proceed.  I tend to talk throughout the exam announcing relevant findings (normals included) as this shows the client all that i am viewing and demonstrates value of the exam (if i find something i might ask questions like ""did you know about this lump?"" or ""Has anyone talked to you about dental disease in the past?"").  Once done examining, i signpost again that we will discuss DDx, diagnostic recommendations, and treatments possible.

Regarding writing things down, i prefer to bring a laptop into the room, or 2nd choice to have a computer available.  Laptop lets me place it on a table while facing the client -- so i can type while looking at client talking (i can type well without looking at screen or keyboard).  If a clipboard works well for you, go for it.  If you tell client up front that you are taking notes to avoid missing something important, they usually understand and appreciate the thoroughness -- it is about communicating around all you are doing so client isn't left guessing.It is not too late to consider veterinary.  Keep in mind that zoo vet specialty is competitive, so you will need to excel to be considered for such (or know the right people).  You should definitely look to shadow at veterinary hospitals or volunteer with animals somewhere (or get an entry-level job) since experience is a requirement for nearly any vet school you might apply towards.  Such experience might help solidify your choice also.  I had people in the forties with my class in school, so age should not deter you.After undergrad (which is usually 4 years), then you have 4 years of vet school followed usually by 1-2 years internship (1 year general, 1 year specialized), the 3-4 years residency in Radiology.  Keep in mind that Radiology is 1 of the most popular specialties available so of those applying for Residency often the chance of getting such a residency is 20-40% (depending on the year applying).

Good luck!I know plenty of people that try for vet-school admission, but since the competition is so high they reserve med-school as their Plan B.

I think you would always regret it if you did not try.Completely depends on where you decide to accept the job.  Some hospitals make work-life balance a priority, and some do not.A lot is based on what the adult thinks regarding the child's presence.  It can also depend on age or maturity of the child.  

If the adult thinks the child would be better away, i can often find a team member able to distract the child with a coloring sheet or something.

If the adult has prepped the child and feels their presence is important, then i include them in discussions about what is about to happen logistically.

Ultimately it is up to the parent/guardian to have the hard discussion with the child, and assist with the child's emotional needs during such a time.  The above also goes for mentally handicapped adults that come with a guardian.Stethoscope, bandage scissors, suture scissors, watch, scrub cap, nail trimmers (big dog and cat/small mammal sizes).  Beyond that are accessories like stethoscope label or fun things to accessorize scrubs and such.Wow congrats!  And thank you for wanting to work with food animals -- so needed!

In-state would be best financially unless the out-of-state options are offering tuition help (not loans, but discounts & scholarships) which would make more financial sense.  There are sone great grants for loan forgiveness post-graduation if working in large animal sector for underserved areas around the nation.Depends on where you are located, and your overall goals.  I've met some vets from smaller towns that have small zoos that prefer using a vet nearby than hiring one full-time.  Those colleagues of mine worked private practice seeing dogs/cats snd exotic pets, then every week spent time at the zoo.

I do agree with others though that your focus should be acceptance into vet school first (very competitive).Outside of industry jobs, i believe some hospitals and companies are starting more Telemedicine -- would still have client interaction but outside of hospital setting.If you are human CPR certified, then you have the option to render aid, but you need to ensure you won't be injured in the course of offering.  The biggest thing to do in a case of human medical emergencies though is to call for emergency medical help (911 if you are in the USA).Sometimes it is not the amount of information but the structure with which it is written.  A huge single paragraph is daunting to many (those are the Reddit posts i skip), whereas bullet points, multiple paragraphs, and white space on the page is easier for most people to interpret.I typically always attend to things in this order:  
(1) take care of the patient & medical needs,
(2) take care of the client,
(3) take care of the team members involved,  
and (4) take care of paperwork and money side.

Notice the 4th item is only attended after the others have been taken care of.I usually combat this from clients by providing statistics on how often OTC products of any kind actually work on pets with chronic allergies, compared to Rx meds.  Doesn't work for everyone with this mindset, but if done properly with empathy, I love how often these client hear it (especially if they hear it repeatedly every time they visit).  For the average person, they have to hear Advertising or Information 6 separate times to make them act (at least on average).Dermatologists are more than willing to share stats on things like OTC Antihistamines vs. Rx meds.  Usually they offer such in webinars of convention talks.  Can also look up literature and studies on VIN to have the medical evidence behind your recommendations -- i've occasionally printed out these scientific studies and handed them to clients that are interested in the information.Vets should know how to perform what workup for what presentation of clinical signs given the signalment of the patient, and what resources or tests would be most useful to determine cause or help design treatment.  Many of us end up memorizing frequently-used drugs, or commonly seen diseases, because we've had repeated exposure to those ones or looked the dose up so frequently we end up remembering those.Many places will take a veg assistant who is eager/ready to learn.  However, depending on where you are located, as an assistant you might not be legally allowed to perform certain job-duties.  Early on this is not likely a problem, but as your career grows, you might hit a ceiling without a vet-tech degree (again depending on where you are located).Be open minded for your job shadow.  Watch what the vet does and also everything the other team-members do also.  Being an animal-lover is a start, but what you might not realize is that you need to like people too -- most animals are attached to at least 1 human that helps make medical decisions, and performs medical treatments (like giving daily meds).  Many times what the veterinarian does is not ONLY helping the animals, but also being a bit of a therapist for that pet's family.  My point is that you will need to like serving humans also.A passion for animals is only 1 part if the veterinary track.  You also need a passion for the medicine, and real-life experience in the veterinary sector.  You are required to have a certain number of hours of experience either working in animal/veterinary jobs or shadowing veterinarians before you can even apply to vet-schools.  Often vet-schools are more competitive than med-schools for acceptance (for example, you need higher GPA than med-school, especially in math/science courses).  So if you ultimately decide to head in the veterinary direction, this does NOT guarantee you would be accepted into vet school.  I know Drs who went the human-med route because they couldn't get accepted into vet-school.There are a ton of options for EMRs.  Also, there are newer tech options using AIs to write SOAPs based on audio-recordings during the exam with the client.Even more is when they do finally decide to do something, and then you also recommend a recheck in a couple of weeks to ensure it actually worked.  Then they blow off the recheck appt and return MONTHS later claiming what was done before ""didn't work""! -- then why the F didn't you return sooner as you were TOLD!","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment contains information from both medical and veterinary fields.

Luthury,"As a 2022 grad I signed with a non-corporate small anima GP in the Seattle area (HCOL but not as much as NYC or Cali) and was offered 100k salary, 10k sign-on, 3k relocation, no production for first 2 years, 4x 10hr days which rotated and sometimes included Saturday.

zach113,"They would have to make improvements to their application, if they kept applying with the same app every year the odds of acceptance would be low. But if they did file reviews with schools and worked on what admissions committees told them to, their odds would go up every cycle. And if you were to apply to different schools every year without making improvements, it would be better to just apply to every school the first time around and see what happensI’m not sure why your application was not satisfied, but if you want to take a break from schooling after high school, you could start working as a veterinary assistant right now. It doesn’t require any certification or degree. Many clinics will hire new assistants and train them in the necessary skills. If you’re having difficulty getting hired with no experience you can also look into kennel tech positions or volunteer at a local shelter and try to build up animal experience and possible make connections. There are vet assistant certification programs online but these are not necessary, myself and nearly all of my coworkers were hired without completing one. 

Working in a clinic and can give you a great idea of if the field is a good fit for you. You can also learn the roles of the assistant, technician, and doctor, and decide whether pursuing more school feels right for you.Illinois has two phases to their application process. The first phase is a hard GPA cutoff, and I think it was around a 3.7-3.8 for OOS students this year (based on people self reporting on the SDN forums). For IS they are likely more lenient but I’m not sure about those numbers. Once you’re past phase 1 they stop looking at your grades and assess the rest of your application.Look into Iowa, Minnesota, Michigan, Kansas, and Louisiana!

insectsrmarvelous,"ONE MORE THING!

While it is important to get used to the 60 Q timed exams, I barely did them as I felt I could use my time to study other things than work on my endurance. I did have double time, so take this as you will. I instead practiced with 20-30 Q timed exams (note: you can set up species specific and veterinary specialty timed exams on Zuku). After reading the question and answer choices I would go with my gut answer and try NOT to change it. You'll be pleasantly surprised with your improvement on the timed exams if you do this because (literally everyone says this) you know more than you think you do. It's also a safe space to experiment getting comfortable trusting your gut!Another great resource! I did find the VIN course helpful and I think it’s worth the $75.

I also used the Clinical Veterinary Advisor: Dogs and Cats by Etienne Cote to aid in my study guide, flashcards, and to review topics. I think having multiple modalities of learning helped me overall because it didn’t keep learning stagnant.

Everyone learns differently though, so you have to find what’s best for you. This is just what worked well for me as a person with ADHD and who struggled to pass the first time!Yes, that’s it :)That’s a great question! I would check out the USDA’s website:

https://www.aphis.usda.gov/aphis/home/

If you look under the “Resources” tab there is information on animal welfare laws, reportable diseases, etc. 

Is this what you mean?Hope it helps, even just a little!Always good to prepare! When registration for the Nov-Dec 2024 window opens it may be good to have written documentation ready. You will have to fill out a form on the ICVA’s website under testing accommodations: 

 https://www.icva.net/faqs/

Maybe get familiar with what they need now as it can take a bit for them to approve it!I’m sorry for your loss. When the anxiety of the test itself is kept to a minimum, one is definitely to perform better. Thank you for sharing your experience.While I don’t feel comfortable stating where I attended for anon reasons, I struggled for far too long from studying incorrectly. I don’t fully blame my veterinary institution, albeit I’d argue there should be some improvements in the curriculum.How I made my flash cards: 

I find handwriting them to be more helpful than typing. I made a key by writing out each species, assigning a color to each. I used a heart symbol for random or cross-species questions. On the question side I would mark the top corner with the color/symbol to indicate what species the question was asking.

“What type of hyperadrenocorticism is indicated if there is suppression @ 4 hrs, but none @ 8 hrs?”

On the back l would write the correct answer, “Pituitary Dependent HAC”

I would have a friend quiz me a couple times a week, especially when getting closer to the exam date. You can also use them by yourself if that works better for you!Hi there! Yes, I believe that should be fine. I would maybe contact the ICVA if you’re unsure!I’m glad I could be of help. You have this in the bag!!That was exactly my reaction. The form is just tedious!Hmmm, I think applications for the Nov-Dec 2024 window open around June 1st (don’t quote me!) so you should have adequate time to get any documentation in order! :)I made SO many of them! I think it’s important to only make cards on topics you’re unsure of. I’d also write an “X” or “✔️"" on the bottom of the card to indicate if I got it correct or not, then would sort them into separate piles! Feel free to message me if you have any other questions 😊I’m here for ya! I’m not a foreign vet, but I graduated and had to write the exam again. I’m trying to find all the ways to distract myself, but it’s proving to be challenging.

They were taken aback that no one but them could remember the correct anatomical name of the knobby bit 🤣🤣🤣OP, be careful of these offers.

Glum_Ad_6207,"AMEN! Even veterinary pathology is hard to get into ! I tried 3 times. Human medicine has a much better system for people to get training and into a field where they can be their best versus the ridiculous internship then often specialty internship and then residency if lucky system in veterinary post-graduate training.Exactly true since internships in veterinary medicine are not a REQUIREMENT as a means of evaluating the level of knowledge and proficiency outside of the academic program before issuing a license to practice independently as they are for MDs. Physician's have been required to do at least one year of post MD training since the Flexner Reforms of the early 1900s.  The most comparable residency in human medicine is family medicine (3yrs) which was  made a specialty because studies in the mid 1960s showed even internships did not do an adequate job in preparing ""General Practice"" physicians.

A lot of these new programs are 3 year veterinary programs going year-round. Students will be burnt out by graduation.I think the problem has always been that academics in veterinary medicine have this huge god of all medicine complex that really blinds them to understanding and learning, not only from other professionals but from anyone who is not an academic peer. They truly lack any sense of wisdom of the world or basic compassion and thus the horrible culture that results. I can only remember a few professors in veterinary school in the early 90s that were compassionate and good teachers. Most were older and had veterinary practice experience outside academia first.Veterinary medicine really almost has no regulatory standards that have any real consequences for practitioners and the educational standards are essentially based on the past idea that a veterinary student needs  to be lectured about everything but not actually learn enough about anything specifically to be competent in doing it. Most licensed professions have much higher competency standards to earn and keep the license.Woefully unprepared because the curriculum is obsolete in trying to prepare a veterinarian to tend to all creatures great and small. The PEW Report on Veterinary Medicine said it was obsolete in 1988 when it was published.Hopefully someday veterinary schools will learn how to both educate and train students to be competent at graduation or at least adopt a post-graduate year of realistic ""training"" where skills and drills in a specific practice sector are rehearsed under the guidance of a teacher/coach to insure to the public that the doctor who becomes licensed to work independently has been thus certified to perform competently. This was what I was taught to understand what ""professional"" meant.*I was trying to learn instead of memorize. It’s a memorization exam. You’re wasting your time trying to become a better vet through the navle.*

Thus NAVLE in no way actually measures ""real world"" competency that involves thinking, understanding and applying medical knowledge correctly. It is such a stupid exam that proves only the ability to memorize and take guesses. Much better if we adopted a multiple step exam over a few years format like physicians and engineers take to be licensed professionals.Do you mean like how long to cook garbage before feeding it to pigs?  The problem is that the knowledge base must be deep and relevant to the area of problem solving. The NAVLE is testing for the obsolete concept of the universal veterinarian which was decided to be obsolete in the late 1980s by the Pew Study on the Veterinary Profession.Obviously you fail to understand that specialization in particular section of veterinary medicine is needed. You are talking about the past and the obsolete veterinary curriculum we are saddled with that really only creates a superficial veneer of knowing. Dean Emeritus Peter Eyre of Virginia Tech along with others have described the issues brilliantly. Eyre suggests we follow the engineering model of education where in the development of engineers in the 19th century the different fields of engineering like civil, mechanical, electrical and chemical all came into being. We do not expect all engineers to be competent in building roads and designing  computers etc

You can find Eyre's address about the All-Purpose Veterinary Education in the Journal of Veterinary Medical Education which is free access except for the last 1-2 years of the Journal. While there, I suggest you also look at papers written by Richard Halliwell who writes papers with similar view points. Halliwell was the Dean of the Edinburgh School of Veterinary Medicine. Halliwell also wrote a wonderful article in the Canadian Veterinary Journal  in 1999 about the folly of trying to  produce omnicompetence which is impossible.  

And the answer to incompetence is better focused training in a specific sector and periodic recertification as is done for physician assistants and also done for American Board of Veterinary Practitioners who are specialized in a specific sector of practice.If you do not comprehend that the profession has grown in complexity that  cannot realistically be taught to all veterinarians in 4 years then I doubt you are concerned that failing to allow veterinarians to focus in a limited sector has inevitably lead to mediocrity and no real measure of realistic competency other than taking a multiple choice test. Be thankful every time you fly that the standards of competency are much higher other than passing just one exam. 

And to be exact, the most generalized of practitioners in human medicine, Family Medicine, have a 3 year post -graduate program of study covering all ages  plus obstetrics and surgery. That amount of study  was determined through studies in the 1950s and 1960s showing even physicians with a required internship were not providing the best quality of practice. It is foolish to expect that 4 years of veterinary school can train someone to be competent in medicine and surgery across multiple speciesI love the comments about the OP being out of touch with the profession and expecting  something more along a really professional educational experience. Yet, his points have been made for decades about the schooling from students and from some academics in the schools who do not drink the Kool-Ade and worship at the altars of the profession. And woe to the heretic who questions the unquestionable truths of veterinary medicine. 

The basic question is that following the same, archaic truths in the profession have lead to its decline. There is an arrogance in this field that makes innovation impossible because innovation requires us to thoroughly re-examine the accepted  truth in light of the new realities of new knowledge, especially the knowledge from outside our comfort zones that shows old beliefs to be obsolete. I will say we are in decline because numerous studies that called for changes in the profession over the past 5 decades have been ignored mostly because veterinarians did not think of it or it conflicted with our visions of our profession being the ""Greatest Profession of ALL"" as I continue to hear instead of acknowledging our real imperfections and working to address them.

""**Things alter for the worse spontaneously; if they not be altered for the better designedly.""**

**Sir Francis Bacon, English philosopher and scientist**But the field is full of unrealistic expectations and less than reasonable returns on the time almost anyone will ever put in to it. Veterinary field is essentially mediocrity in everything except for those very few for whom things tend to work out for but those often have to make extraordinary SACRIFICES in order to get where they are and then tell everyone how wonderful their career is. It is great that a few survive and thrive but the odds are against most and getting worse compared to decades ago. From my reading, I think the attrition from veterinary medicine  is from having to deal with those odds. The 9th  Veterinary Educational Symposium was in  June1987 and they published the proceedings in the Journal of Veterinary Medical Education in the fall of 1987.

A paper delivered stated that  Mississippi State Veterinary School had listed and counted all of the course objectives over the first three years. There were 215,619 course objectives mostly from lecture courses (over 80%). That meant learning an objective every 6 minutes every day  for 3 years. They wondered if that was too much back then. Think of how much more they have added to even ""try"" to keep a curriculum relevant for all species.  

Veterinary curriculum is based on obsolete idea of graduates being universally omnicompetent in multiple species at graduation. Of course none of the educators have to be or could be.  Total intellectual dishonesty in the veterinary schools.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

>All node runners will need to stake MYST in the network in order to provide dVPN services. The amount of DAI that can be earned depends on the amount of MYST at stake, which is proportional to the desired value of their daily rewards. The formula for this is 1 MYST = 0.01 DAI.

If you don't want to buy your own MYST to stake, you can also borrow it from the delegation pool

>To support token holders, there will be an opportunity to earn rewards by having a stake in the network. These MYST tokens will be taken out of the market and “frozen” in the Mysterium Delegation Pool. The Delegation Pool is particularly useful for node runners who can’t buy and stake MYST in the network, as they will be able to “rent” tokens from the Pool.The NodeUI logs, however, aren't too detailed. It just shows you who is connected, and for how long. The issue is: Can I prove that it was a Mysterium user who visited a specific site at a specific time? For this, you would need to log each ip that the user visited.

Living in France, I am unwilling to run a non-whitelisted node because the government is pretty strict about these things, and can shut off your internet after about 3 infractions. Having the option to generate detailed logs would be very useful.

I also can not assume that the Mysterium whitelisted traffic is benign. There has been no transparency about what this traffic is (or will be, I am assuming all whitelisted traffic is test data now).The NodeUI logs, however, aren't too detailed.

After a few warnings they can even cut your internet off. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/iq90vst/  I am 100% certain. It is called the law HAPODI. As a private person, you are responsible to make sure that no one uses your internet connection to download copyrighted materials. After being warned, they can fine you 7500 euros and then cut off your internet connection.

Also, most european countries have similar laws. Up until a few years ago, they weren't really enforced, but based on stories from my friends in several european countries, the enforcement is starting to become more strict. The general rule is: The more corrupt the country, the less likely they will come after you.

(Also, what is that link that you posted?) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/iqc61ys/  You are wrong (I live in France, and can read the texts in french, also, your link doesn't link to anything).   


1. HAPODI was subsumed into ARCOM in Jan. 2022: It did not go away. They just added an extra layer of bureaucracy, which is what the french love doing.
2. Second, you can check the [french wikipedia site](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haute_Autorit%C3%A9_pour_la_diffusion_des_%C5%93uvres_et_la_protection_des_droits_sur_internet) to see how often HAPODI is enforced.
3. You can go to the ARCOM web site. The easiest is to go to the [FAQ](https://www.arcom.fr/faq#collapseQR1582), and you will see sections describing why you got a letter from them, the next steps, your responsibilities, the fines, etc.
4. Lastly, I can tell you that I got a letter a few years ago from them for illegally downloading movie over bittorrent. I don't download much, and also was using encrypted torrents at the time (which only protects you from your ISP snooping on you), so the government agency (or content creators) are just entrapping anyone on the bittorrent network who has an ip address in france. They tell you, in essence, to stop and that if it happens again in 6 months they will escalate. 

Now, it is not as bad as it sounds. I believe that after 6 months, all your previous infractions are removed (to verify, I am basing this on my memory). Also, there are so many steps involved that it would probably take 20 years to cut off your internet if you were a repeat offender. You will have to pay the fines though. The first thing that everyone does when they get a letter from HAPODI (pre 2022) or ARCOM (after 2022) is that you sign up for a cheap VPN.

The problem is that if you are running a Mysterium node with ""Public traffic"" activated, you will certainly get caught, and the french law says that you are responsible for everything that happens with your internet connection, even if if was a guest that was visiting. I suspect that most french mysterium nodes are only using B2B traffic because they already know this. I also know that the amount of traffic in general is pretty low in France, so the number of people torrenting on a french Mysterium node is probably small. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/xo5wkq/setup_another_node_and_got_an_email_from_xfinity/iqckx2c/  I am noticing the same traffic on my pihole as well. I am running my node in whitelisted node, so my assumption is that this is not streaming, but rather part of their web-scraping business. I too don't know why they are using my DNS to do this, as I am blocking some of their requests! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/wdfxzx/strange_amazon_dns_queries_from_mystnode/ij3rdos/  I'd be curious if people in Russia are having problems using the mysterium dVPN as well. Does anyone have any info on that? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ujgbt5/censorship_in_china/i7j5izw/  I support the long term objectives of Mysterium, and I don't even care if I am making money or not by running a node. Someone asked what types of rewards people are getting with a residential node, and I responded honestly. Is that a reason to remove the post??? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3i86g0/  Here is my original post

>I am making <0.5 MYST per month on a node in Croatia. (whitelisted, fiber line).  I am losing money with this node and will soon be deactivating it.

I was then asked how I could be losing money as it is ""free"" to run a node that simply generates ""passive income"", to which I responded

>I am loosing money on this node because. There is a sunk cost of buying hardware that will never be paid back (even if an RP4 is cheap!). You need to pay for the electricity. Time is money: you need to devote a little time to keep you node running, updating if from time to time, and keeping informed what the devs are doing. This is time that could be spent doing better things that actually make money.
> Note: Profitability is lower if you run a whitelisted node. Also, some regions of the world get more traffic than other places, and some people are in fact quite profitable. It is my impression that the europe in general has little real traffic.

Now that you have the facts, you can draw your own conclusions. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3liluf/  This is not moderator ""mistake"". It is a deliberate attempt to make Mysterium Network look good, and to hide anything that does not fit their hopium narrative. Just look at the official twitter feed and you will find the same hopium/pump-n-dump mentality. I speculate that their motives are to increase the number of users and to hype the MYST token (this is the only opinion of mine in this thread, so I am insulted that the mods slapped an ""opinion"" banner on this.). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3lxtfd/  You are just as secure as you are on your home network. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tsbqed/security/i2u1wzl/  I think that you are asking a couple different questions:

1. Is the announcement good news? YES
2. Is the announcement ""MAJOR NEWS""? NO
3. Does the announcement solve the problems concerning leadership and transparency of the Mysterium VPN project? NO

Mysterium dVPN has the same problems as many other open source projects. In particular, 

* There is no clear leadership. It is not clear who to contact concerning problems, suggestions, etc. It is not even clear how the team pays for their salaries (is this volunteer? Do they use the 20% setttlement fee? Are the VC investments? If I make a PR, will they pay me?).
* The team as a whole does not value transparency, or does not understand what kind of transparency is required for this kind of project: Simply creating a vague ""roadmap"" diagram with no verbal description is useless.
* The team pays people to promote the project on twitter and to offer support on discord. However, these people are not close enough to the leadership team to answer many questions that people have. Instead of saying ""I don't know"" or ""I'll ask"", they instead try to spin an answer that looks as favorable as possible. Oftentimes, it takes about 10 times to find out that they either don't know or don't know what they are talking about.
* Many questions that the community has gets answered ""informally"" via chat, twitter, reddit, and are never answered in a formal way (such as on their web site, FAQ, etc). This makes it impossible for newcomers to find all the information that they need.
* When the community starts to voice frustration, the leadership simply ignores the underlying complains (""This is open source, why are they complaining?"").
* And lastly, if the project is open source, it is also a business (they take a 20% settlement fee). Because of this, the leadership doesn't feel like they need to explain the ""business decisions"" that affect the ""users and node runners"".

I have seen many projects with good ideas fail for the above reasons, and unfortunately, Mysterium seems to be going down the same path.

In any case, I emphasize that the software works well from a user perspective (though we do need an auto-reconnect feature, a better way to sort nodes by quality, and some kind of proxy service before I cancel my commercial subscription). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ts51dt/are_node_runnersusers_happy_with_the_recent_major/i2u43b4/  There is definitely a lack of transparency with this project. The good thing is that the software mostly works, the bad think is that no one is using it. I think that the community would be ok with this if they felt like they were part of team.  I would simply ask that the developers write a blog post that describes the development roadmap, along with key steps that need to be achieved. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tiq12f/mysterium_concerns/i1g8kmp/  The FAQ hasn't been updated. It notes that ""Mysterium"" takes a 20% cut, but it doesn't explain why and who this goes to. 

In all likelihood, I am probably ok with them doing this, it is just that there is ZERO information about the ""settlement fee"" and how operations and salary are being funded.

I would like to emphasize that it is NOT HARD to fix this problem:

1. Write a blog post describing the structure of the Mysterium team, how the developers are paid, what sources of funding the team has, and what the 20% cut is used for. Is the 20% cut the sole source of funding salaries?
2. Write a second blog post that outlines the development roadmap. Key goals should be provided, along with rough-order-of-magnitude estimates for when they will be completed (i.e., Q1, Q2, etc....).
3. Write a third blog post describing the origin of the traffic that is coming out of the Netherlands. This is probably all test traffic, but WHAT IS BEING TESTED? If you are computing up-time and bandwidth statistics, node runners would like to know!
4. Write a fourth blog post describing what ""whitelisted"" traffic corresponds to. Residential nodes have a lot of risk, and it is quite possible that ""benign"" whitelisted traffic could have unintended consequences (for example, if 100 people log into an the same website from the same IP, the IP could get banned). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/tiq12f/mysterium_concerns/i1im6uy/  The NodeUI logs, however, aren't too detailed. It just shows you who is connected, and for how long. The issue is: Can I prove that it was a Mysterium user who visited a specific site at a specific time? For this, you would need to log each ip that the user visited.

Living in France, I am unwilling to run a non-whitelisted node because the government is pretty strict about these things, and can shut off your internet after about 3 infractions. Having the option to generate detailed logs would be very useful.

There has been no transparency about what this traffic is (or will be, I am assuming all whitelisted traffic is test data now). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/swx7dd/making_running_a_mysterium_node_legal_and_safe_in/hy3q6ji/  I'm not sure where you got the 1000 MYST number from, but here is what is written on their [blog post](https://www.mysterium.network/post/introducing-myst-tokenomics-2-0-powered-by-the-iq-protocol) about the use cases of MYST:

I am running in whitelisted mode so that I only get test traffic (about 1.1 GB per day). After one month, I'll have made about 5 Myst. 

If you want more traffic, you probably want to turn off whitelisting. This means that your node will be visible to the public and that they will be able to download whatever they want.  My understanding is that whitelisting will be for streaming traffic only once they enter mainnet, and that now it is 100% test traffic. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/pwuvky/whats_the_point_in_running_a_node_when_the/hekxh43/  You are in essence running a Tor exit node. Just do a search on that to see if you are ok with the risk.

Mysterium does have the option of only allowing whitelisted partners to use your node, but as far as I can tell, this whitelisted traffic only exists in a few insignificant countries (I don't think there is any traffic at all in Europe). Perhaps this will be expanded to more countries in the future. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/rrauim/what_if_someone_uses_your_node_ip_for_illegal/hqjz2dc/  It is logical that this would happen, so no proof is required. The BBC detected suspicious behavior and hence blocked the IP address. The interesting question is: What suspicious behavior triggered their bot to do this? Perhaps it was anomalous download rates, or several people logged into the BBC with the same IP address. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/rnmwx1/running_a_node_for_a_month_caused_my_ip_to_be/hq2odet/  Awesome. Now we just need some kind of auto-reconnect and this will start to be useful! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/s8xkvh/mysterium_vpn_adds_kill_switch/htkzf7j/","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

fire4ice,"Considering that microbiology is a part of veterinary medicine.... If you want to be a veterinarian, then you're really going to have to learn to like biology....Try seeing if you can get a job as a vet assistant or kennel tech and start getting veterinary hours now. A lot of my classmates didn't realize the requirements of becoming a veterinarian and got a rude awakening by our professors. Some of them did cry, since our college is in a smaller community and there's not a ton of veterinarians to work with. It'll take a lot of stress off. It'll also put you on the clinical side of things and you'll know if you like it or hate it. The first thing I got trained to do as a vet assistant was how to get histories, so it is a fair amount of talking. 

Some of my classes are really hard. They actually are having me take the same biology classes as all the premed students and it's a lot of information and reading. So it can be stressful. 

One of my classes is where professors come in from the ADVS department and talk about jobs other than being a veterinarian. The most interesting of all the professors was a professor with a doctorate in beef nutrition. She had gotten accepted into veterinary school but fell in love with research. She runs some really interesting research projects at our school like what poisonous plants do the rumen of a cow. So she encourages to get involved in any research project at the school. 

Also have a backup plan for if you're not accepted into vet school so you didn't just waste all the time of going through undergrad. There's also a lot of competition when it comes to it so make sure you're doing all you can to be the best candidate. My school has a pre -vet club that will hold mock interviews, events on how to suture, volunteer events, and lots of other really cool stuff so try to see if your potential college has any other similar clubs.","Veterinarian.

booboobewwy,"Hi! I recently graduated in August 2023 with a BS in Animal Science and microbiology minor. My undergrad gpa is a 3.33 but I have not calculated my science or last 45 gpa. It would probably be around 3.0 - 3.1 area. Most of my C’s were from my advanced microbio courses taken for my minor during Covid online. I also got a C in Ochem II and physics II. My grades aren’t the best but I have a variety of experience. I’m currently an intern at an AZA zoo in their veterinary department and will end up with around 600 hours after I finish in a few months. I have 330 hours from being an intern at a marine mammal rehab center, 550 hours from being a fellow at a wildlife rehabilitation center, 800 hours from a small cat/dog clinic as a veterinary assistant/receptionist, so about 2200 veterinary hours. I also worked at a small non-profit farm and have about 300 hours, 700 hours working as a kennel attendant, so about 1000 non-veterinary animal hours. In addition, I have about 400 hours working in the food industry, 200 animal care volunteer hours from 2 different aquariums and a wildlife center, and 400 hours working as a laboratory assistant (basically almost like a TA) at my school and helped prepare for all the biological science courses. I will probably have atleast 400 more animal hours by the time I apply, after I finish up with my current internship and get a job somewhere else. I live in Cali and only feel like my only chance is getting into Western. I also don’t want to apply to Caribbean schools but open to some international schools.

PureBreadTed,">I’m also worried about coming across as unprofessional if I show emotion during a pet euthanasia.

I can't speak to how you'll come across in vet school. I've also only been in this industry for a few months.

that being said, in this time (I work at an urgent care) I've seen two vets cry due to completely heart wrenching cases.

first case was with a new-to-us vet. this case was not euthanasia, but unfortunately ended similarly. the dog came in limping. we'd administered pain meds via IV (iirc) and the dog immediately went into arrest. we attempted CPR but were unsuccessful. when we broke the news to his owner, it was gut wrenching. we were all in tears because it was completely unexpected. Dr later says he believes the limping was due to a clot and we may have unfortunately pushed the clot out of position while giving meds leading to cardiopulmonary arrest.

second case was a euth. an older dog came in because she got cut on the farm. she was a ""farm dog"". at the point the finally came in, she'd been bleeding for over five hours and had stalled her owners T-shirt in an attempt to help her clot. our DR was immediately suspicious and asked about rat poison. owner called a family member who was able to check and she did unfortunately get into it. while we were waiting to hear back from ASPCA poison control so we could transfer her to ER, our DR was demonstrating how to use an ultrasound for a new tech. The DR realized there was a lot of free-floating liquid in her abdomen. Dr asked to do an X-ray because she was older and intact. She unfortunately had pyometra. However, the owner was willing to pay for the expensive surgery, so she is good, right? wrong. by happenstance, the X-ray also captured nodes on her lungs. the owner had no idea she had cancer. this case was heart wrenching because despite our best efforts and an owners willingness to do whatever it took to get her better, she wouldn't be able to do so. in the end, we were all feeling it because it felt like everything was against this sweet girl getting better.

my point here is it is normal to have emotions in this job. we can't always be stoic like it doesn't affect us. those emotions make us human and show we care about the animals we are looking after.","Veterinarian.

Toches,"It all depends on how you take it. I graduated in 2022

One of my clinics ive had pretty good support, but they're informal with everyone, no Dr. gets referred to as Dr by staff except one practice owner.

The other one i've gotten some push back from assistants and techs because I stray from the way the medical director that they'd been used to from the last 2 years does things, she brought it up to me, I just don't care, it's what i'm comfortable with and I have contingency plans and am open to other opinions if my first tries don't take. I get both Dr. first name, and just first name, because its what i'm used to (oldest brother is a pharmacist and my dad was an ER doc, I don't like Dr. Lastname because its what they get too, it's weird to me).

Example, I tend to not immediately push for Tear testing / Fluorescein staining the first time I see an animal (she does) for a conjunctival issue (I offer it, but if i'm not immediately leaning toward using a steroid what would it change knowing that the pet has a tiny corneal ulcer / abrasion or not?)You have to budget your mental energy

Because my practice owners are brother / sister so if people call for Dr. Their last name, our staff has to ask ""which one?"" So we all go by Dr. First name for that reasonDoesn't bother me in the slightest.

I went into this field for pets, not prestige

Im also a guy, so usually there isn't a question of whether or not i'm the doctor, so that may be a contributing factor.¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯Speaking to a lawyer is probably your best bet

I've heard of some people setting up an LLC under their own name and getting a DEA through that ""company""Avoiding exposure to anesthetic gas should be done regardless of her status as pregnant or not, not a good thing to be exposed to regardless of how big, small, or other factors.

Usually, veterinarians don't have too much in the way of physical accomodations needed as long as she can examine patients and fulfill other daily duties. You can still take radiographs while pregnant with proper protection, but vets themselves don't normally do this over here in the U.S., moreso gowning up if absolutely necessary, usually radiographs are taken by our techs.If she's dealing with anxious animals, nothing would change if she's currently using more fear free / fear reducing practices.

Animal comes in for an appointment bouncing off the walls? Send home some sedatives and try again, still bad? Pet gets dropped off, fully sedated, and worked up while sleepy.

2) ones that aren't THAT sick, but don't have great prospects going forward, the specific one that comes to mind are 2 20 y/o cats from a woman who went into hospice care but is the last surviving family member, she came in to euthanize them (actually really healthy for their age) because once she dies they go into shelters, and would 99% be lifers there, she wanted to personally send them off before she died.

Lunarcircle12,"Scribes! Scribes for doctors with ADHD/ADD! Louder for the ones in the back! 

I am a scribe for a doctor with pretty severe ADHD. My whole role in life is making sure she has what she needs to function in the clinic which can vary depending on day.

Sometimes it’s me telling her to drink water lol. It’s a flexible accommodation that meets the doctor where they are at, and is relatively cheap for a clinic overall. Furthermore, it improves efficiency and production. We work as a doctor unit in a busy ER.

Certain large breed dogs (Rotties, Pits, Cane Corsos, German Shepherds) are very popular where I live, especially among male owners, but rarely get any kind of training. Huskies and cattle dogs are pretty popular too, bu people don't realize that brainy dogs like that need regular mental stimulation, not just exercise!

As for masking symptoms, even when mildly sedated, pets usually react if a painful part of their body is touched or manipulated. My vet also takes into consideration what's going on with the pet.

They are GREAT, but priced accordingly (somewhere around $10K per unit).I reported the /r/mildlyinfuriating/ post for sharing personal information, harassment, and threatening violence and just received a response that the post was already reviewed and will not be removed (just locked).

Absolutely infuriating.  The dog very well could have microscopic disease that compromised the integrity of its femur, and at any rate, none of the clinic employees deserve the threats of physical violence that some of the smooth-brained armchair quarterbacks over there were recommending.

People wonder why they have trouble finding a vet anymore.  I hope the team at that hospital finds the Reddit post and attaches it to the poor dog's records so the next vet knows what they are getting into.

At least the dog is no longer suffering.Don't stick a lavender-topped tube more than once.  The first aliquot of added blood consumes the anticoagulant, and it's much easier to get microclots (or real clots) in blood added subsequently.

If you have inadequate sample volume to fill the tube appropriately, then the small ""exotics"" EDTA tubes can be game-changers.  Downside is most reference labs charge for them, while the standard size tubes are usually free.  Still, it's useful to have a few on hand for old cats, kittens, chihuahuas, etc. even if you don't see exotics.We are test-driving the Purevax combo FVRCP + rabies and the 3-year Purevax rabies; I'd been looking for a way to test the waters and see how many of our clients would spring for a 3-year Purevax over the 1-year (NB - it's about triple the list price per dose for the 3-year versus the 1-year).

I cut a very-suspicious-for-vaccine-associated-sarcoma tumor from a cat last week, tripled in size since October and dirty margins even though I went all the way to the body wall.  The cat got an Imrab rabies vaccine in May 2021 (from a shot clinic), and I'm guessing it was right over the epaxials (not on the limb), because that's where I removed the tumor.

It would take a LOT for me to give an adjuvanted rabies vaccine to a cat in light of that surgery.  And if *really* had to use one, I'd be *damn* sure to give them as distally on the limb as I could.

I don't think ""backorder of the 1-year non-adjuvanted vaccine"" would be a reasonable excuse to skip vaccination.  Human health/rabies exposures/zoonosis still have to be considered as a possible consequence if we let vaccines lapse.I absolutely agree that new grads should be paid a flat salary rather than a production percentage.  Early in your career, you should be focusing on applying what you learned in vet school to real world cases, and your employer should be focused on training and mentoring you.  All of those processes (when done successfully) take time away from your caseload and therefore negatively affect productivity.

But, if you insist, then standard 21% production means you should be bringing in between about $480K/year in receipts (for $100K salary) and $720K/year (for $150K salary), which is close to the salary range we typically offer new grads.  Individual hospitals will have differing policies on which line items count toward production - frequently, things like prescription diets, technician appointments, and medication refills are excluded from that total.  Veterinarians who perform surgery and dentals will generally have an easier time making those production goals, although it can be done with a busy medical-only schedule.

Good luck in your career development!It's not really that different from a pervasive attitude in human medicine - a pill to treat symptoms of a disease is often preferred to intentional, inconvenient lifestyle changes that may fix the problem altogether.","Medical Doctor.

funfettiqueercake,"For those doing flank, can you still autoligate ovarian pedicles?My thoughts as a fairly new grad here:

It is super stressful, no matter how many surgeries and complications you’ve had, to go looking for a bleeder. That may explain some of the shortness/distance following, if she’s just feeling overwhelmed and panicked from it. 

I would not challenge a student to speed up if they are seeing a number of complications, especially not the same day. I’d honestly want to observe all your surgeries at this stage, to try to find what specifically needs adjusting in your technique. 

It does seem like you’ve had quite a number of complications for the amount of surgeries you’ve done. To your below comment, I would not recommend manipulating your ligature nor suture with instruments more than necessary to tie the knots. Messing around with the knot seems like a great way to weaken or dislodge it. I agree grabbing the cut section above the ligatures (are you double ligating?) is more appropriate. Many HQHVSN docs recommend using a modified Millers or similar for best tightening down ability. 

For the uterine body slip, transfixing ligatures can be used too. 

All in all, I would definitely recommend practicing your knot tying outside of live surgeries. Consider the suture size and material you’re using well. Ask to be observed the entirety of the surgery. Slow down, there’s no point in going fast if you get complications that take longer to fix.","Medical Doctor.

I don't know what school you're describing but it could easily be mine.There is no “accepting” the offer, you are committing to whatever you get by applying. All of the dates are on the VIRMP website, including the withdrawal deadline.I graduated from there a few years ago.

1. Vet pay has increased substantially since I started vet school in the mid-20teens. I am looking for jobs as a specialist and...I have been taken aback by the offers I've been receiving, in a good way. Granted these jobs are in VHCOL areas, but still. Technicians and assistants, of course, remain vastly underpaid on the whole.

2. Yes, compared to a human doctor, I will make a lot less than them but honestly that is something I rarely if ever think about unless I come across it on Reddit. I don't think the comparisons are helpful.

3. The student debt can be insane and that makes whatever salary you get feel so much smaller. No question about that. This is the only spot where being an MD/OD physician with that higher salary and similar student loan burden makes a difference.PS as a resident I am objectively very underpaidNo it does not.

mountainmanstan92,"Lol what?

I have a doctorate degree, whether I can practice medicine is separate from my degree.

I'm a doctor of veterinary medicine even when I cross state lines, but that doesn't mean I can practice there without a license and that doesn't make me all of the sudden not a doctor because of my lack of ability to practice in that state.

You can be a non-practicing/unlicensed doctor of vet med.I think we're discussing two different topics here.

Whether I trust someone or they have the legal ability to make medical decisions is a much different conversation than whether the degree they poses makes them a doctor.

But yes to your point, a PhD is also a doctor. And no they cannot practice medicine. Just like a DVM is a doctor and needs a license to practice medicine. The degree makes them a doctor, it's literally in the name of the degree. This is a non-issue you're trying to discuss.

I had health anxiety throughout vet school about zoonotic disease as well as non-infectious diseases, given all of the pathology and pathophys we are learning. Don’t let health anxiety deter you from applying or going to vet school - but definitely find a way to manage it, or it can become very distracting and all-consuming. 

Going into school and learning about the transmission of rabies helps a lot - it’s highly unlikely you would ever get rabies from a scratch or bite from a vaccinated animal. Keeping up with your rabies vaccine and titers are, obviously, important. I have had to be boostered a few times when scratched or bitten by unvaccinated stray/shelter animals and wildlife.

two_beagles,"Have you tried the ICVA practice NAVLE assessment? That was more realistic than the prep course testsSimilar story to me. I went to Melbourne Uni and only had to pay 10k deposit. I got the same TD professional loan of $140k over 4 years. I didn’t qualify for BC’s loans so I was short about $35k each year for tuition. A combination of savings, work and a family loan was the only way I could afford it. 

I had friends that had to take off the third year and work to be able to afford their tuition. The university doesn’t love this option but if you can manage to do a couple years then they don’t want you to drop out. Other students took third year off for mental health reasons as well.Haha great idea! I was too busy working to fret for the start of Jan but now I keep checking my emails waiting to hearWhat are the pros to tail and ear cropping? What was the ear crop originally used for?I just finished my fourth and final year a few weeks ago. I have a son that’s almost two. There were so many times I wanted to just throw in the towel during my final year. It’s one of the most difficult years because you always feel like you don’t know enough, aren’t good enough and you are assessed on everything too! Plus studying for the NAVLE in any spare time you have kills your brain. 

I really resented school at the start of final year because it meant taking time away from my son. The only comfort I can give you is that they are little and won’t remember the time apart. But if you finish this degree, you could work only a couple of days a week and have way more time with your kids when they will remember it. 

Is it an option to get a nanny to help out a few nights a week so that it doesn’t all fall on you husband? I think an investment in some help around the house/with the kids will give you the strength and sanity to continue and you can easily pay back the amount you spend on help now.

cymbals922,"I’ve been an assistant for almost 7 years, my pay starting out in 2017 was $13/hr. The clinic I work at was smaller back when I started, and now we’re at 9 doctors and we’re very busy. Over the years I’ve been able to grow into a more “management” type position. Unfortunately with that I do less vet assistant work, and more inventory, ordering, and admin work. But I am now making $25/hr in my position. If you’re able to work your way up and take on responsibilities within your clinic, you can potentially increase your pay. But that will probably come with less vet assisting duties if you’re taking on different responsibilities. Or just more work on top of everything you already do, so you should be prepared to have less down time or work more hours. 
Also, I lived with a roommate for a number of years, and I am now married so I live in a dual-income home. We can still only afford to rent between both of our incomes, I don’t think we’d be able to buy a house any time soon.

Few-Tea-2162,"Hi OP, fellow student doctor here (DVM2026). Ofc I’m not a doctor yet, but this sounds like a toxic work environment. While working as a tech before getting into vet school I had a situation where the vet I was working for was the most condescending person I had ever met in my entire life. She proudly paraded through her clinic saying that she went to UPenn and was a VMD rather than a DVM (her colleague was a Ross grad) and she would make EVERYONE feel like utter shit. I wasn’t allowed to even hold animals during appointments because “you graduated from a university outside of the US so i’m pretty sure you don’t know how to properly restrain an animal”. By that point I had worked 8+ in small animal and had 2+ exotics and was concurrently getting experience in lab animal. She said this because I’m puerto rican born and raised in PR and she thought I wasn’t “legal”. Needless to say, I lasted 2 months working there. I kept in touch with some of the techs and they just eventually quit too. Nobody wanted to work for her. But Karma is real! She had to close her clinical due to the lack of techs applying to work for her as her reputation preceded her.I meant to add the years of experience next to the numbers!I know this may not be what you’re looking for, but I’m planning on doing DVM and consequently a residency in Lab Animal Med so I can be a clinician and a research at the same time. The research may not be at the same capacity as a PhD, but it’s something you can look at to have as an option. I’m currently in 2yr of very school and I do research part-time while in school. My school doesn’t offer a PhD/DVM dual program.That sounds good. I’m applying to a fellowship this summer at the place I want to do my residency at, and I feel like it would be a good match since I already worked (as a technician) in this place before. So most of the vets know me. So I hope that type of networking does help me in the long run.I’m pursuing Lab Animal Med. I’m not in the bottom 25% of my class, but I thought my rank would be higher. I know I can’t compare myself to anyone, but it’s hard when I study and get average grades compared to others that have “photographic memory” and just get As. Even though this is disheartening, I know I have to value my self and my work as I am 1 of 2 students in my class of 112 doing part time research during the semester, and I know that has some incredible weight in terms of experience.","Veterinarian.

badgerhoneyy,"I've started with them recently. It's not a vet-client relationship, most of the questions are fairly straight forward. You get the transcript of the original enquiry, so I usually need to ask a couple of follow up questions. Most things are similar to r/askvet \- you're basically telling them to go to their usual vet, and advising if it's an emergency or can wait until Monday, that sort of thing. Other's are asking for nutritional advice, there'a a bit of behaviour, which I find is just too involved for the format, or owners just needing a bit of reassurance. So far, I don't mind it at all. You get to chose the questions you answer, and can accept phone enquires too which pay more, but I've not done that. 

  
The pay structure was not transparent until after my final training, but once you're signed on it's clear what you get paid for each question. Most are $11, some have a bonus attached, and I think with more experience that can go up too. There is no minimum number you are required to answer, but I find if I put a couple of hours aside to sit and dedicate a bit of time to it a couple of times a week, that works well for me. 

  
I'm a practicing vet, but not based in the US, so our regulations and insurance are different, so I can't comment on that. I think I read that VIN might have advice on that for the US folks. 

It did take them a long time to get me set up, it was a few months between my 'interview' and getting verified, and then getting alerted to being set up. So be prepared for that.I honestly have no idea. Probably worth contacting them.Yeah. Can only assume units are different as we’d aim for BG of half that!Slightly different, but I applied for the five year, didn’t make the grades of the conditional offer, and was invited to join the six year course instead. At the time it felt like a failing of some sort, that I was somehow second rate, and that the extra year would seem like forever. I swallowed my pride and did the six year course. 

That was ten years ago and I actually really loved vet school, and love being a vet. Hell I can complain about it as vocally as the next burnt-out jaded overworked underpaid MRCVS, but if you want to be a vet, then relish the offer and have a blast!","Veterinarian.

 So I assumed they're talking about convenience euthanasia but it doesn't sound like that's common at all.


so it sounds like vetmed might be a good career for someone who loves animalsThats how it should be imo. Puts vets in an uncomfortable ethical position.StillThe ethics are pretty black and white imo.

We also all have a right to dictate how we are addressed (within reason obviously, like you can’t be called Dr if you have not gotten a doctorate)Another reason rural areas have trouble attracting vets (depending on state) is that most graduating vets are people w uteruses and many states are very dangerous for us, regardless of if we want children or not.

Metzger4Sheriff,"There is a shortage and it will only get worse as the boomers increasingly retire. Each school adds what, 100-150 graduating vets per year, adding about 4000 new vets while 5000 are leaving the profession each year. Many health professions saw a huge jump in retirement during COVID by people who otherwise would have worked longer, and I’m sure it was the same with vet med. The AVMA actually is the one insisting there won’t be a shortage, but they are motivated to keep supply low, and demand and salaries high (the AMA does the same thing with human med, and I think most people have personally experienced the shortage there). 

Idk if how they are going about adding seats is the best way, but there is no doubt that seats need to be added. There is no reason for any vet to feel overworked or become burnt out when there are literally thousands of people who want to be vets, have the school and work experience to show the capability to become vets, but simply can’t bc there weren’t enough vet school seats to train them.I’m not a lawyer, but agree with the other comment that a conviction would be the actual issue. The charge alone shouldn’t be an issue if you’re found not guilty or if the charges are dismissed. I am not in VA, but found this resource which may be able to help: https://vsdvalliance.org/get-help-ayuda/legal-services/ 

Scroll down the bottom and select your local agency to contact them directly.You may be able to get a part time job or internship at your university’s lab animal resources while you’re getting your degree. That should count towards your required hours for certification and might turn into a full time job after graduation. It will also give you a sense of the work/pros/cons before you graduate so that you can change course if you discover it’s not a good fit.Aside from getting a specialization as a vet tech,  teaching hospitals will sometimes hire human radiology/ultrasound techs just to do that work, so that may be a route for OP but they should definitely check their state laws to ensure they would be permitted to work with animals in their state and be prepared to get a job in human med as a backup bc these jobs are very few and far between.The vet school application process really doesn’t get nearly enough blame for the mental health crisis that is affecting vet med. Aspiring applicants are told to make sure they have a backup plan in case they are not admitted, while at the same time anyone who actually makes time for a backup plan can’t really expect to be competitive against the average applicant statistics. Not to mention the financial loss most pre-vet students take due to the hours of unpaid labor they provide in trying to increase their animal/vet contact hours. And the competitiveness is completely artificial bc there is vet SHORTAGE FFS!! Vet schools could probably double their seats and there would still be plenty of work for everyone. Ugghh none of this helps your wife but it genuinely makes me so so mad how much the process beats down on applicants so they’re already completely emotionally exhausted and burnt out before they even take their first vet school class.I meant that the industry could handle having twice as many graduates a year. Logistically schools could not just double their seats— what we really need is more schools in more places.The obvious idiocy aside, do they really think people can just decide to get a job as a vet? Just submit an application and make sure you tell the hiring manager how much you love animals!Most of the people on this sub are working clinically, so I’m not sure if anyone will be able to answer you directly, but one thing to keep in mind is that all human therapies are tested in animal models first, so there should generally be less of a need to have to translate human data to animals, especially from an R and D perspective.","Other.

IAmVladimirPutinAMA,"Average new grad salary in the US for small/ companion animal general practice is ~$120,000.

US veterinarians often have a ""ProSal"" compensation structure-- you are paid some percentage of the revenue you produce for your employer, but also have a guaranteed minimum. You can find articles about the details.

Like any other profession, compensation will vary based on geographic area. High cost of living areas (ie, New York City, San Francisco) will have higher compensation than low cost of living areas (such as rural communities).

Off-hours/ emergency coverage can also impact compensation.Short answer: No.

Long answer:

In a just world, I'd say you should administer first aid if you find someone in legitimate need of immediate lifesaving action. But first, look up your state's good Samaritan laws. If you save someone's life by performing CPR, can they sue you later for breaking their ribs in the process? It's happened!

Also, if you do choose to involve yourself, step out of the way immediately when the professionals arrive (Police/ ambulance).

Also note that, state dependent, licensed veterinarians are sometimes authorized to practice human medicine in truly cataclysmic disasters (ie, nuclear war)Not sure if you're in the US or elsewhere in the world. The OP of this post is asking in a US context. In the US, ""doctor"" is a title earned through education, not licensing. If a veterinarian (or physician) is only licensed to practice in the state of New York, their title is still ""Doctor"" when they go on vacation to California.

Plenty of people have the title of ""doctor"" completely independent of any government-issued license-- for example, college/ university professors.

Thoroughly understood that there are places in the world that do not require a doctoral degree to practice veterinary medicine, and I do not know what the title conventions are in those place.Generally not a major risk.

If the client is visibly high in your interactions and seems to be going through the meds faster than you'd anticipate, then you're setting yourself up for some possibility of legal trouble.

If you're prescribing them an inappropriately high volume of meds that the client is then selling on the street, you know how that's going to end.

Three sorts of legal issues, broadly speaking:

* Regulatory: If you're abusing your state and federal licensing, those license may be revoked.
* Criminal: If you're a drug dealer, expect to be prosecuted like any other drug dealer.
* Civil: If someone is hurt as a direct or indirect consequence of substance abuse that you facilitated or enabled, you are at risk of being sued.

In the non-flagrant scenarios, a civil suit is the most likely risk. Someone dies from overdosing on something you prescribed? Grieving family members may try to deflect some responsibility onto you. Someone is hurt in a car crash when your client drives under the influence of something you prescribed to their pet? The accident attorneys take a shotgun approach of suing anyone even tangentially involved-- and you, as someone in a relatively high income profession, are a juicy target.","Medical Doctor.

Milky0608,"I currently work at Banfield but I came into the position as a transfer from a summer job program (I work weekends while I'm in vet school) so unfortunately I don't have any advice for the traditional interview questions that they might ask. 

However, I did want to pop in here and say that a lot of people will have polarizing views on Banfield and that's simply because it's like any other vet clinic, each one is going to be different. Each one has a different family of people that work together or don't work together well. I would encourage you to ask questions that will help to determine if the culture of that clinic is something that vibes with you. Maybe how they handled sick leave during COVID or how they accommodate clients with disabilities. If there is something that you feel passionate about, be sure that the people around you at least feel somewhat similar or you're bound to butt heads. 

As for the work itself, it's extremely formulaic. You'll do basically the same thing everyday and some people love that, some people hate it! There is a nice consistency to it and you are usually empowered to say no to things that go beyond what you feel comfortable doing.

BytesHQ,"Hey! Sure thing.

MYST is the utility token at the heart of Mysterium Network. It's used for P2P micropayments within the network. If you’re using the MysteriumVPN, you can pay with MYST token. If you’re a node (provider of the VPN service) you receive MYST. Jaro actually designed our unique Layer 3 micropayments infrastructure, called the Hermes protocol, to enable these fast, anonymous, and censorship-resistant transactions between network peers.

Our upcoming tokenomics model re-energises MYST and supports the growth of the network and the development of new use cases. For the Mysterium community, it simplifies payments for users and node runners by introducing DAI stablecoin as the reserve currency, so you're not exposed to market fluctautions.

**Tokenomics 2.0 also adds DeFi and Governance properties to MYST.**

The engine behind the tokenomics model was designed by PARSIQ. Mysterium is among the first projects to integrate their new IQ Protocol. The protocol powers the Mysterium Delegation Pool, a completely **""risk-free, collateral-free solution""** that allows holders to stake MYST and earn rewards in DAI stablecoin.

Node runners stake MYST to run a node. Nodes can also rent MYST from the delegation pool without any upfront capital, and a portion of their earnings can be used as repayment. This DeFi mechanism rewards stakers, growing their stake proportionate to pool size and network traffic.The full Tokenomics 2.0 model will launch sometime in **Q1 2022**. We aim to launch the BETA version of the Mysterium Delegation Pool in the next month or so. This version of the staking pool will enable delegators to **earn rewards in MYST**, as we manage the testnet version of the pool.

**You can read more about Tokenomics 2.0 here.** [https://www.mysterium.network/post/introducing-myst-tokenomics-2-0-powered-by-the-iq-protocol](https://www.mysterium.network/post/introducing-myst-tokenomics-2-0-powered-by-the-iq-protocol)**Hey guys! Savannah here (@BytesHQ), Brand Director at Mysterium.**

**Thanks for all your great questions. I'll kick things off with answering this one, since it's specifically my domain...**

Before mainnet, our marketing was heavily geared towards acquiring VPN users and nodes. It was really effective and our growth took us by complete surprise - annually we had 487% in network traffic, 611% increase in monthly active users and 773% increase in nodes!Post-mainnet, we’re switching things up and thinking bigger. 

&#x200B;

Our strategy is to grow the brand awareness of the protocol itself, attracting developers and projects to expand the Mysterium ecosystem. We will be incentivising teams and entrepreneurs to build censorship-resistant products and services on the network.

&#x200B;

This also means a strong focus on new strategic partnerships, with global hackathons, incubators, dWeb projects, internet organisations, and marketing partners. We will have a number of integration partnerships announced in the following months, including new L1 and L2 blockchain ecosystems.

&#x200B;

Our next partnership announcement is with Community Gaming - a platform for E-sports tournaments. We see a lot of value in connecting with the global gaming community, who are often the first to pioneer new technologies and drive innovation in the tech sector generally. Our gaming tournament will go live this Friday, 27th of November, and last for 4 weeks.I can share some things! (But we'll save the best announcements for later :) 

The fund is being created to fast-track the development of the Mysterium 2.0 ecosystem and help bring more of the Web3 to life.

We know that entrepreneurship and development are two separate worlds. We plan to provide incubator support, similar to seed funding, encouraging projects to validate their business models via MVPs and POCs. Teams will get to work with an in-house network of mentors, product marketers, designers, business development team and industry partners who can help scale their business. This is to set up teams for long-term success.

We’d also like to make sure that resources are being used to solve real world problems! We will work with businesses, NGOs and digital rights organisations who will benefit from Mysterium’s technological solutions. We will allocate funds to developing solutions based on their particular challenges. 

The fund will fully launch in 2022, though some initiatives and hackathons will kick things off in the following months. If you are a developer/entrepreneur with a great idea for how to use Mysterium's tech stack, please reach out so we can make some Web3 magic.Please see my answer here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/comment/hlwopyd/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/comment/hlwopyd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

To compete with big players means evolving beyond a single product alone and becoming a strong ecosystem that fights censorship from all sides -  web infrastructure, apps, networks, APIs for all. This is all part of our Mysterium 2.0 strategy.Expanding into the Web3 metaverse is certainly one of our main priorities, but I think it’s important to note that while other decentralised ecosystems may reveal their impact in 5 or more years, **Mysterium is fully compatible with the legacy internet.** This means both **Web2** and Web3 services can plug into the network right now.  
Though there are many more, the first use cases that have already shown promise (and will be a major focus in the short-term) are **VPNs/DPNs, enterprise-level proxy services and third-party integrations.** 

We already have eight projects connected to Mysterium’s Network as a Service (Naas) business, including five commercial VPNs and three proxy services. 

We’re also currently being test-run by cryptocurrency wallets, browsers, search engines, data scraping solutions, and streaming services, building default privacy and censorship-resistance into the apps we already use.   
Watch this space for Mysterium 2.0 :)Hello :) One of our main priorities is to protect nodes and ensure they aren’t exposed to malicious actors or traffic.

We do this in a number of ways;

1. Whitelisting
2. Exit node guidance
3. Relay nodes/multi-hops and traffic slicing (coming 2022)
4. Network encryption

You can read our FAQs for all the details on these points. [https://www.mysterium.network/faq](https://www.mysterium.network/faq)**There’s a number of ways you can increase your earning potential:**

1. Don’t enable the only “whitelisted traffic option” if you’re not based in the following countries: Canada, U.S., UK, Italy, Australia, or India.
2. Have a strong and stable internet connection.
3. Run your node 24/7; some user sessions can be very long and if you are disconnected from a client, they will be reconnected to a more competitive node, which means losing that client.
4. Double-check your configuration and ensure users can access your node.
5. When users have discovered your node, bookmark it as a favourite.

With Tokenomics 2.0, the more you stake the greater your opportunity to earn. It also means the more you have staked as a node, the more likely you are to be selected for the “Smart reconnect” feature in the VPN.Yep, we’re talking to a few CEXes, please follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MysteriumNet) or [Telegram](https://t.me/mysterium_network) for frequent updates. We’ll announce it as soon as we are ready :)

In terms of DEXes, we’re already on 4 and spread across 3 different chains (Polygon, BSC and Ethereum). We believe that this covers the majority of the current crypto community who like to use DEXes. We’re now looking at how to provide more liquidity there, rather than spreading it over more DEXes. But we're also keeping an eye on more blockchain ecosystems that gain traction.Unlike many other projects who are happy to print tokens out of thin air, we have chosen to carefully manage the tokenomics of our project. 

We want to create long-term value for users, nodes and token holders, so a deflationary and fixed supply model was always our choice. It may not seem as appealing when compared to the millions of tokens being pumped out by our competitors and distributed in insane prize pools, but we feel this strategy can only work against the interest of their communities in the long term.>What is your 1 year price prediction for $MYST and what are the big amplifiers for growth in the project?

[We’re not focused on token price or speculation](https://ahseeit.com/finance/king-include/uploads/2021/01/142505726_447439846302801_7774568449271182698_n-1003149366.jpg), but on building an amazing technology that actually makes a difference.

Our internal team goal is to grow network traffic and P2P payment volume, with aims to grow 100x in the next few years.

The VPN market is expected to reach 75 billion by 2027, so our biggest impact will be ito innovate this market that has been stuck in ancient mindset and infrastructure.Hi everyone, Savannah here (head of brand). Thanks for joining our live discussion and sharing your questions - will get to them very shortly.It just so happens that MEXC was the one of the first exchanges with direct Polygon integration, with access to US market, that we were in conversation with. We knew they had a good reputation as one of the first movers in the space, even contributing to crypto-related legislation in many countries, including the US. The goal was always to support our node runners so they can easily off board their MYST earnings. With MEXC nodes can make direct withdrawals of Polygon MYST to their account, and swap them for USDT.

  
We’re currently in conversation with other global exchanges, stay tuned :)In 2017 Mysterium raised 14 million CHF. Thanks to proper finance management, we have enough funds for the next 3-5 years of active development. About 15% of MYST Treasury is allocated as a long-term company resource for building the ecosystem. This includes investing in our future growth and scaling the network with more products and services. The 3 million will be spread across 3 years, with the assumption that we are achieving profitability and bringing in multiple revenue streams as time goes on.That's the plan. But I don't have any details I can share at the moment 🔮Necto Labs is currently focused on R&D and network growth side of things, rather than $MYST tokenomics and models (and airdrops!). 

The “value” that MYST token holders receive through Necto Labs is that by seeding or integrating new products and services, this will bring in traffic to the network, so node runners will earn more, and we can spread more value across the whole ecosystem. I’m hoping in the coming weeks we can share some details of what we’re funding and/or building. The idea is to tap into some new markets and see how far we can push the network and protocol.  
It’s definitely a long game, and we’re working on scaling the b2b service (Lavafy) concurrently.

MYST is the utility token at the heart of Mysterium Network. It's used for P2P micropayments within the network. If you’re using the MysteriumVPN, you can pay with MYST token. If you’re a node (provider of the VPN service) you receive MYST. Jaro actually designed our unique Layer 3 micropayments infrastructure, called the Hermes protocol, to enable these fast, anonymous, and censorship-resistant transactions between network peers.

Our upcoming tokenomics model re-energises MYST and supports the growth of the network and the development of new use cases. For the Mysterium community, it simplifies payments for users and node runners by introducing DAI stablecoin as the reserve currency, so you're not exposed to market fluctautions.

**Tokenomics 2.0 also adds DeFi and Governance properties to MYST.**

The engine behind the tokenomics model was designed by PARSIQ. Mysterium is among the first projects to integrate their new IQ Protocol. The protocol powers the Mysterium Delegation Pool, a completely **""risk-free, collateral-free solution""** that allows holders to stake MYST and earn rewards in DAI stablecoin.

Node runners stake MYST to run a node. Nodes can also rent MYST from the delegation pool without any upfront capital, and a portion of their earnings can be used as repayment. This DeFi mechanism rewards stakers, growing their stake proportionate to pool size and network traffic.The full Tokenomics 2.0 model will launch sometime in **Q1 2022**. We aim to launch the BETA version of the Mysterium Delegation Pool in the next month or so. This version of the staking pool will enable delegators to **earn rewards in MYST**, as we manage the testnet version of the pool.

**You can read more about Tokenomics 2.0 here.** [https://www.mysterium.network/post/introducing-myst-tokenomics-2-0-powered-by-the-iq-protocol](https://www.mysterium.network/post/introducing-myst-tokenomics-2-0-powered-by-the-iq-protocol) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlwqiag/  **Hey guys! Savannah here (@BytesHQ), Brand Director at Mysterium.**

**Thanks for all your great questions. I'll kick things off with answering this one, since it's specifically my domain...**

Before mainnet, our marketing was heavily geared towards acquiring VPN users and nodes. It was really effective and our growth took us by complete surprise - annually we had 487% in network traffic, 611% increase in monthly active users and 773% increase in nodes!Post-mainnet, we’re switching things up and thinking bigger. 

&#x200B;

Our strategy is to grow the brand awareness of the protocol itself, attracting developers and projects to expand the Mysterium ecosystem. We will be incentivising teams and entrepreneurs to build censorship-resistant products and services on the network.

&#x200B;

This also means a strong focus on new strategic partnerships, with global hackathons, incubators, dWeb projects, internet organisations, and marketing partners. We will have a number of integration partnerships announced in the following months, including new L1 and L2 blockchain ecosystems.

&#x200B;

Our next partnership announcement is with Community Gaming - a platform for E-sports tournaments. We see a lot of value in connecting with the global gaming community, who are often the first to pioneer new technologies and drive innovation in the tech sector generally. Our gaming tournament will go live this Friday, 27th of November, and last for 4 weeks. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlwopyd/  I can share some things! (But we'll save the best announcements for later :) 

The fund is being created to fast-track the development of the Mysterium 2.0 ecosystem and help bring more of the Web3 to life.

We know that entrepreneurship and development are two separate worlds. We plan to provide incubator support, similar to seed funding, encouraging projects to validate their business models via MVPs and POCs. Teams will get to work with an in-house network of mentors, product marketers, designers, business development team and industry partners who can help scale their business. This is to set up teams for long-term success.

We’d also like to make sure that resources are being used to solve real world problems! We will work with businesses, NGOs and digital rights organisations who will benefit from Mysterium’s technological solutions. We will allocate funds to developing solutions based on their particular challenges. 

The fund will fully launch in 2022, though some initiatives and hackathons will kick things off in the following months. If you are a developer/entrepreneur with a great idea for how to use Mysterium's tech stack, please reach out so we can make some Web3 magic. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlww10u/  Please see my answer here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/comment/hlwopyd/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/comment/hlwopyd/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

To compete with big players means evolving beyond a single product alone and becoming a strong ecosystem that fights censorship from all sides -  web infrastructure, apps, networks, APIs for all. This is all part of our Mysterium 2.0 strategy. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlwpp6d/  Expanding into the Web3 metaverse is certainly one of our main priorities, but I think it’s important to note that while other decentralised ecosystems may reveal their impact in 5 or more years, **Mysterium is fully compatible with the legacy internet.** This means both **Web2** and Web3 services can plug into the network right now.  
Though there are many more, the first use cases that have already shown promise (and will be a major focus in the short-term) are **VPNs/DPNs, enterprise-level proxy services and third-party integrations.** 

We already have eight projects connected to Mysterium’s Network as a Service (Naas) business, including five commercial VPNs and three proxy services. 

We’re also currently being test-run by cryptocurrency wallets, browsers, search engines, data scraping solutions, and streaming services, building default privacy and censorship-resistance into the apps we already use.   
Watch this space for Mysterium 2.0 :) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlwz663/  Hello :) One of our main priorities is to protect nodes and ensure they aren’t exposed to malicious actors or traffic.

We do this in a number of ways;

1. Whitelisting
2. Exit node guidance
3. Relay nodes/multi-hops and traffic slicing (coming 2022)
4. Network encryption

You can read our FAQs for all the details on these points. [https://www.mysterium.network/faq](https://www.mysterium.network/faq) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlwuoy2/  **There’s a number of ways you can increase your earning potential:**

1. Don’t enable the only “whitelisted traffic option” if you’re not based in the following countries: Canada, U.S., UK, Italy, Australia, or India.
2. Have a strong and stable internet connection.
3. Run your node 24/7; some user sessions can be very long and if you are disconnected from a client, they will be reconnected to a more competitive node, which means losing that client.
4. Double-check your configuration and ensure users can access your node.
5. When users have discovered your node, bookmark it as a favourite.

With Tokenomics 2.0, the more you stake the greater your opportunity to earn. It also means the more you have staked as a node, the more likely you are to be selected for the “Smart reconnect” feature in the VPN. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlwvg1z/  Yep, we’re talking to a few CEXes, please follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/MysteriumNet) or [Telegram](https://t.me/mysterium_network) for frequent updates. We’ll announce it as soon as we are ready :)

In terms of DEXes, we’re already on 4 and spread across 3 different chains (Polygon, BSC and Ethereum). We believe that this covers the majority of the current crypto community who like to use DEXes. We’re now looking at how to provide more liquidity there, rather than spreading it over more DEXes. But we're also keeping an eye on more blockchain ecosystems that gain traction.Unlike many other projects who are happy to print tokens out of thin air, we have chosen to carefully manage the tokenomics of our project. 

We want to create long-term value for users, nodes and token holders, so a deflationary and fixed supply model was always our choice. It may not seem as appealing when compared to the millions of tokens being pumped out by our competitors and distributed in insane prize pools, but we feel this strategy can only work against the interest of their communities in the long term. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlwrwoe/  >What is your 1 year price prediction for $MYST and what are the big amplifiers for growth in the project?

[We’re not focused on token price or speculation](https://ahseeit.com/finance/king-include/uploads/2021/01/142505726_447439846302801_7774568449271182698_n-1003149366.jpg), but on building an amazing technology that actually makes a difference.

Our internal team goal is to grow network traffic and P2P payment volume, with aims to grow 100x in the next few years.

The VPN market is expected to reach 75 billion by 2027, so our biggest impact will be ito innovate this market that has been stuck in ancient mindset and infrastructure. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlwxzxy/  Hi everyone, Savannah here (head of brand). Thanks for joining our live discussion and sharing your questions - will get to them very shortly. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vyu85k/ama_hi_reddit_donatas_and_savannah_here_from/ig4ffbo/  It just so happens that MEXC was the one of the first exchanges with direct Polygon integration, with access to US market, that we were in conversation with. We knew they had a good reputation as one of the first movers in the space, even contributing to crypto-related legislation in many countries, including the US. The goal was always to support our node runners so they can easily off board their MYST earnings. With MEXC nodes can make direct withdrawals of Polygon MYST to their account, and swap them for USDT.

  
We’re currently in conversation with other global exchanges, stay tuned :) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vyu85k/ama_hi_reddit_donatas_and_savannah_here_from/ig4h25o/  In 2017 Mysterium raised 14 million CHF. Thanks to proper finance management, we have enough funds for the next 3-5 years of active development. About 15% of MYST Treasury is allocated as a long-term company resource for building the ecosystem. This includes investing in our future growth and scaling the network with more products and services. The 3 million will be spread across 3 years, with the assumption that we are achieving profitability and bringing in multiple revenue streams as time goes on. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vyu85k/ama_hi_reddit_donatas_and_savannah_here_from/ig4hs9v/  That's the plan. But I don't have any details I can share at the moment 🔮 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vyu85k/ama_hi_reddit_donatas_and_savannah_here_from/ig4ip0q/  Necto Labs is currently focused on R&D and network growth side of things, rather than $MYST tokenomics and models (and airdrops!). 

The “value” that MYST token holders receive through Necto Labs is that by seeding or integrating new products and services, this will bring in traffic to the network, so node runners will earn more, and we can spread more value across the whole ecosystem. I’m hoping in the coming weeks we can share some details of what we’re funding and/or building. The idea is to tap into some new markets and see how far we can push the network and protocol.  
It’s definitely a long game, and we’re working on scaling the b2b service (Lavafy) concurrently.

I know people who have had bad experiences and that's 100% valid but I personally have had good ones and know others who have too.

I can't tell you how many times I cried about flunking out when i was actually in that first semester lol. I'm graduating in May.

My motto is always that it's better to try and fail than to not try at all and wonder what could've been.

rememberjanuary,"While money should be the main factor in considering a school, you need to also realize that if you don't accept this school, you may never get an acceptance to vet school in the future.Being a veterinarian is a good career, but you have to be in it pretty much 100%. If you're not, it will suck your soul out of you. It still might even if it's everything you've ever wanted it to be. If you can't see yourself doing anything else then do it, but recognize it has a lot of downsides too (just as any career).

The first thing is definitely the income to debt ratio. I'm in Canada and my debt to income ratio after graduating was approximately 1:1. That's manageable. But in the US where it can often be 3:1 or even 4:1, you need to seriously consider things. Salaries are getting better but it's no physician salary, not even close. Some specialists can make 300k plus, but as someone in residency right now that is a LOT of work.

The second thing is that this career is emotionally taxing. It asks that you give all of your emotional self to others. Giving it to your patients is great and you can really see their appreciation when you help them. But not all clients are as grateful, agreeable, or available. Vet med has a high attrition rate.

If you do consider vet med seriously consider careers outside general practice. It may not be your ideal career working for government, or food safety, or epidemiology, but salaries are still quite good and you don't have as many stresses, or at least not the same kind.

I will say that the DVM is an incredibly useful degree and I've been privileged enough to have some wonderful experiences through my training and met some amazing people. But you need to consider the whole picture. In fact, if you do consider applying, this kind of knowledge is going to make you a more attractive candidate in interviews.

Best of luck!I think you'll find the cost comparable to most OOS school tuition in the US. And sometimes it's easier to get into too, just because not everyone considers them. There are two schools in Canada offering non citizens spots: OVC and AVC. WCVM may be now as well. Montreal does but is only in French.Veterinary medicine is the kind of career that doesn't end when the work day ends. You bring a lot of that home with you. Sometimes it's actual work, reports and case logs, and other times it is mental anguish.

It also is not worth it if you're going to school in the USA and pay obscene amounts of tuition. The pay just isn't high enough to justify the debt. And the debt also plays a role in mental health.

I had OCD going into vet school and I really struggled with balancing study and my mental health and at one point I was at my lowest ever mental health point.

I've switched directions in vet med now to diagnostics and it's a much better balance, but still a huge time commitment.

In some ways I wish animals were still my hobby or their only purpose was companionship.

You can certainly make it through vetmed and have a fulfilling life but I don't think most people can do that and still have good mental health. Even in residency there are days off where I just sleep the whole day. That's not really living.

You'll find a career you enjoy enough, but is also financially viable.Yeah the DVM is a stupid useful degree. And after 300-400k in debt you are going to put yourself and your family in incredible economic hardship.That's definitely a hardship and I'm sorry you have to bear it. But think about what will happen if you don't finish your degree and get that power of independence if you want. You'll be in hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt working what kind of job? Stuck with what kind of husband? This is an opportunity for you and your kids to prosper.

As the other commenters have said, even if you never go into clinical practice there are a boat load of jobs you can get with a DVM still paying great salaries.

I'd tough it out. You're almost there. Best of luck.All of the North American spots are applied through the Match except in rare circumstances.

Here is the website. You can look into where these spots are, how many are available, what the salary is, etc.

https://www.virmp.org/Where did you get your numbers? Vet tuition in Canada is 12.5k a year more or less at all five schools (cheaper in Quebec for Quebec residents). That plus living expenses would put you at max 160k in debt. Very doable and manageable and completely within the government loan system.

Your numbers are closer to going abroad for vet school. Those numbers are not so doable.I know that grades to get into vet school here are high as all hell. But I would seriously consider moving to SK or MB or AB to gain residency and apply there after a year. Alberta is increasing seats to 100 a year soon. And Sask and Manitoba generally have lower GPA requirements for WCVM.If you're already on loans then an extra 500 bucks for one of the prep courses is a drop in the bucket and a good investment. There are people that study without it, but it's basically a pay to win system and would be incredibly helpful to use those resources.The ICVA practice tests are a confidence interval. It's a 95% CI meaning that if you take the test 20 times, 19 of your scores would be within that range, and then 2.5% of them either below or above that. It doesn't tell you your chances at a pass or fail unless your interval is completely above or below the pass cut off respectively.

Mine was accurate I guess. I got higher than it predicted so that was a 2.5% chance.

VetPrep says something like 95% of people that get to 80% completion in the program will pass the NAVLE. That's as far as I went.I don't remember. Maybe it was after you have written the exam. In any case that's the only way you'd get a range like that.","Other.

https://bit-media.org/cryptocurrency/g20-call-for-crypto-taxation/Thank you for your feedback. So far most of the response for the design has been positive but will share your opinion with the team. The design will evolve with the product.Most people have liked it so far, thank you for your feedback.Thank you for your feedback.The external user testing of the pre alpha should begin this week.This question is on behalf of a community member from China that wishes to remain anonymous: Can you compare Mysterium vs competitor Orchid?Mysterium will provide the community with a top class tool for private communication. The firewall operates on finding certain patterns on the network traffic and comparing them with the known patterns (kind of a continuous cat and mouse game). We of course recommend our users to follow local regulations even if the technology opens other possibilities.It is actually a common practice to throttle internet speed, and more common in certain countries, e.g. US. Throttling depends on limitations imposed by ISPs, such as maximum data transferred, content being accessed (like Netflix), torrent usage or some malicious activity. The goal is not to be classified in one of those categories. VPN usage usually is being throttled ISPs in countries such as China, Russia or other developing economies. This comes from political or economical reality. I.e in most African countries global (transit) internet is very expensive, thus throttling is mainly an economic measure.Thank you for notifying about the mobile logo.We are planning to develop a traffic routing mechanism which would combine splitting request data through different nodes and changing the end-to-end circuit between requests.Hello, when the MYST token has been integrated in the VPN and nodes with the payments system we will be able to apply for relisting. We are also in the final stages of negotiations with several exchanges for listing. As mentioned previously we are looking to get listed on at least one medium size exchange and a decentralized one. MYST is currently listed on: centralized - Liqui, BigONE; centralized - IDEX, ForkDelta.


Our selection process: 

1) We identify possible candidates and whether they meet our current selection criteria (1 medium size volume, the other decentralized or with decentralization and security aspects)

2) We do an investigation about the selected candidates (background, security, customer service, etc)

3) We fill the listing form and contact the chosen exchanges for potential listing

4) We wait for approval of the listing (some exchanges reply quickly but then take time to do background check and process Non Disclosure Agreement)

5) We receive a decision from the exchange and conditions (price, delisting policy, trading pairs)

6) We make final decision whether to list, make payment and proceed to finalize processHello, we can state that we have less than 5%  of funds spent so far and are confident that there are no financial obstacles to stop the development.There will be a certain minimun required amount to avoid spamming and bad actors. The exact number is to be determined, we want everyone to be able to rent their unused network traffic while providing a secure connection for those in need. More details will be provided once MYST has been integrated with the payments system.Our focus is on the product development. We are making sure the product is out and that the MYST token is integrated in the payments system.The founding team is working on the project, dedicating completely to it’s success. No one could know for certain what each individual would/will do, but that would be a highly unlikely scenario.Yes, we’re planning to start working on mobile apps (Android, iOS) as desktop app for mainstream OS’s proof of concept will be ready.Competition is positive news for Mysterium and the community as a whole. It further proves the need for better privacy solutions by involving more people and paving way for ever diverse technical solutions - building secure communications. 

From what we see, Orchid is targeting B2C clients, while our long term vision is to create a protocol plugged to a network of nodes, which provide “Privacy as a service” to dApps and Apps as out of the box solution.

As a I’st stage - we’re focused on building Mysterium protocol and mounting it onto the I’st app, releasing to initial set of users with the goal of testing and improving the experience. 

Other differences and chances for collaboration will show with further product development from both teams. We haven’t tried their product thus cannot speak about details.We think Robertas answer above covers this question too:

I am excited to see what we as a team can deliver in the close/far future. We haven't yet finally planned Q2, but we are looking to work with larger pool of developers and also looking to add CMO and CFO to the team preparing for future developments. Also looking forward to product advancements as we are getting ready to open the network to 3rd party Service Providers(Node operators) and 3'rd party apps (currently we are getting ready to release our I'st app - ""Mysterion"")

As for disappointments. We had a tiny team right after the token sale and suddenly we became an organization accountable to thousands, aiming for high goals and a bit confused at some pressing times. Looking backwards I believe we could have set our priorities a bit better, focused on some things less, on some more, but overall I see no big disappointments.

From my perspective I am very happy - that we are becoming an able organisation with a solid initial team, great ethics, first results in product and team building, and etc..We are not planning to do another token sale. The Timeline on our website will be updated and with the feedback from the pre alpha we will be able to provide the dates for our new Roadmap.Our priority is the network that everyone can later utilize for various uses. 

Read more: https://medium.com/mysterium-network/master-plan-to-restore-our-privacy-f6e923552fd5We have rollout strategy under formation. Your comment is reasonable. We have been thinking about various approaches towards network growth, including subsidies. However, it is too early confirm any of the approaches, as we focus to the product functionality at this stage.- Usual practice is not to run service nodes at home (by residential users). Your ISP may block your internet or get your IP blacklisted, effectively limiting your internet experience.
- As of authorities performing lawful interception everything depends on hosting /  ISP / country policy. You should always be aware of the policy that is being applied by those entities..
- Transports that would be able to bypass certain counties  imposed  limitation should be pluggable to our VPN in the future. Community in need of such transports should be able to implement and adapt to our framework.Mysterium Network acts as a marketplace, its Open Source software allows anyone to join the network both as a provider – selling unused network traffic or as a customer –  buying VPN service from other Mysterium Network providers. Cost ot Mysterium services will be defined by the node operators. Since this will create a phenomenon known as ‘perfect competition’ – we expect prices to be significantly lower than of current VPN providers. Exact price setting mechanism is still a subject of future development and will see a series of upgrades over the time and accumulated experience, with aim to meet the market needs.

Instead of mining anyone can rent their unused network traffic as a node and earn MYST tokens while providing a secure connection for those in need.Here are some details about our partnership with IUNGO:

Senior Legal Counsel - https://mysterium.network/careers/careers-senior-legal-counsel/Thanks :)Thank you! Glad you appreciate some the benefits that our decentralized open sourced network can provide over centralized alternatives.Thank you! Our mission is to provide privacy on demand to all and we agree that security will continue to be an area of increased importance.We are currently laser-focused on enabling users to share their residential IPs which means we’re looking for testers to run nodes on desktop (Windows, Mac).

Node Program [https://mysteriumnetwork.typeform.com/to/Kk7csS](https://mysteriumnetwork.typeform.com/to/Kk7csS)

We will look to release node software on other platforms/ channels once we successfully scale on desktop.

It has not been tested by our team yet, but it could be technically possible to run a Mysterium node on a raspberry pi.

It's impossible to run the current version on ARM processor. We could try to compile a special node version for the ARM processor. We probably will need to apply some changes to be able to compile it. Currently, support for ARM is not a priority. We've not tested it, therefore we can't provide an accurate description of what needs to be done. However, since our code base is written in Go - we might not encounter many issues trying to get the node to run on ARM. We're working on features first, once those are done we'll focus on supporting multiple platforms and we'll revisit ARM then.Yes! Other VPNs are welcome to plug into our network! We have developed a B2B model with custom tools that allow them as well as any other bandwidth buyers to navigate our network.1. The static IP requirements look a bit outdated. We are adding NAT traversal mechanics to simplify adding Residential IPs. But even now it's possible to install a node with dynamic IP with some manual configuration.2. We are considering a range of techniques to protect the exit nodes. Some of these involve whitelisting traffic that comes through our network and whitelisting the exit nodes. When you onboard as an exit node in our network you will be informed of all the ways you are protected.  


Legal FAQ  [https://mysterium.network/legal-questions/](https://mysterium.network/legal-questions/)Our network is open to all companies who need either bandwidth for fast data transfer or access to residential IPs. We offer a selection of custom tools and services based on each client’s needs as we understand that everyone has their own needs for proxy packages.  


Our carefully tailored approach allows us to work closely with our clients to make sure that we offer the best customer service and a sustainable, stable product during our collaboration, without a specific target in mind for the demand of bandwidth.We don't think that migrating from Github is a good idea since we don't have any problem with it right now. In case the project will be banned at any time on Github every developer has checked the version of the repository and it can be restored to Gitlab quite easily.

As for Mysterium apps distribution, MysteriumVPN Android .apk is already available on several other sites:

Apkpure  [https://apkpure.com/mysteriumvpn-free-vpn-to-unblock-access-alpha/network.mysterium.vpn](https://apkpure.com/mysteriumvpn-free-vpn-to-unblock-access-alpha/network.mysterium.vpn)

Apkdata  [https://apktada.com/app/network.mysterium.vpn](https://apktada.com/app/network.mysterium.vpn)

We are in the process of making it available on several others for those that do not have access to the Google Play store.

Regarding F-droid, we will look into it, but generally if it helps our users to reach the app more easily, we will make our apps available on such platforms as well.

\* Always do your own due diligence and research when dealing with third party sites. We take no responsibility for the results and outcomes of using third party software or platforms. We do not issue recommendations.Not at the moment, we are focusing on releasing a desktop node running application for macOS and Windows. Android node running is a bit more complicated as if you will decide to run a node from your phone, it will drain your battery, so we have to find the best solution for this to happen.Openvz is container-based virtualization. If the user owns a host itself with Openvz, it should be possible to run a node on it. The same requirements we have for the docker installation.  


But if the question is about running a node on shared hosting, most likely, the user will not have enough permissions that we need.Allowing to top-up balance using ethers (while automatically convert then into MYST) is part of payment solution we're integrating right now. There are various options how to achieve that. At the moment we're testing and analyzing a few of them. Thanks for mentioning uniswap, we'll definitely look on it.**Mysterium Network, now testing the most vulnerable platform - Windows**

Mysterium Network is happy to announce the availability of our VPN TestNet working pre-alpha client for the most popular yet most attacked **Microsoft Windows** operating system.

Mysterium TestNet is a free VPN testing environment which gives basic security features for internet communication. TestNet, however, is not a production ready system and we appreciate your time testing it and helping us to build this next generation decentralized VPN.Agreed, that is why we have flexible working hours. We try and cross time zones as much as possible so that meetings aren’t too much of a pain, but other than that your time is yours.Thank you, we appreciate your support.Glad you liked it, we will have additional news at the end of the month so stay tuned. :)Hi, of course. As you can see from the above post and our active **GitHub** activity the development is going well. We have released the second major version of our **VPN client** for Mac so if you would like to test and use it for free let us know and we will be happy to invite you to the testing group.Hi, sure.

So far most of the response for the design has been positive but will share your opinion with the team. The design will evolve with the product. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/83a8jj/mysterium_network_sneek_peek_video/dvqt2d0/  Most people have liked it so far, thank you for your feedback. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/83a8jj/mysterium_network_sneek_peek_video/dvv1yhr/  Thank you for your feedback. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/83a8jj/mysterium_network_sneek_peek_video/dvt2q8f/  The external user testing of the pre alpha should begin this week. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/83a8jj/mysterium_network_sneek_peek_video/dw4eint/  This question is on behalf of a community member from China that wishes to remain anonymous: Can you compare Mysterium vs competitor Orchid? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dvsrah5/  Mysterium will provide the community with a top class tool for private communication. The firewall operates on finding certain patterns on the network traffic and comparing them with the known patterns (kind of a continuous cat and mouse game). We of course recommend our users to follow local regulations even if the technology opens other possibilities. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dw1zueq/  It is actually a common practice to throttle internet speed, and more common in certain countries, e.g. US. Throttling depends on limitations imposed by ISPs, such as maximum data transferred, content being accessed (like Netflix), torrent usage or some malicious activity. The goal is not to be classified in one of those categories. VPN usage usually is being throttled ISPs in countries such as China, Russia or other developing economies. This comes from political or economical reality. I.e in most African countries global (transit) internet is very expensive, thus throttling is mainly an economic measure. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dw5zcka/  Thank you for notifying about the mobile logo. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dvtskxs/  We are planning to develop a traffic routing mechanism which would combine splitting request data through different nodes and changing the end-to-end circuit between requests. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dw2giq2/  Hello, when the MYST token has been integrated in the VPN and nodes with the payments system we will be able to apply for relisting. We are also in the final stages of negotiations with several exchanges for listing. As mentioned previously we are looking to get listed on at least one medium size exchange and a decentralized one. MYST is currently listed on: centralized - Liqui, BigONE; centralized - IDEX, ForkDelta.


Our selection process: 

1) We identify possible candidates and whether they meet our current selection criteria (1 medium size volume, the other decentralized or with decentralization and security aspects)

2) We do an investigation about the selected candidates (background, security, customer service, etc)

3) We fill the listing form and contact the chosen exchanges for potential listing

4) We wait for approval of the listing (some exchanges reply quickly but then take time to do background check and process Non Disclosure Agreement)

5) We receive a decision from the exchange and conditions (price, delisting policy, trading pairs)

6) We make final decision whether to list, make payment and proceed to finalize process ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dvztgxi/  Hello, we can state that we have less than 5%  of funds spent so far and are confident that there are no financial obstacles to stop the development. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dvzuozk/  There will be a certain minimun required amount to avoid spamming and bad actors. The exact number is to be determined, we want everyone to be able to rent their unused network traffic while providing a secure connection for those in need. More details will be provided once MYST has been integrated with the payments system. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dvzvdvr/  Our focus is on the product development. We are making sure the product is out and that the MYST token is integrated in the payments system. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dw3rtpa/  The founding team is working on the project, dedicating completely to it’s success. No one could know for certain what each individual would/will do, but that would be a highly unlikely scenario. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dvzwl5q/  Yes, we’re planning to start working on mobile apps (Android, iOS) as desktop app for mainstream OS’s proof of concept will be ready. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dw00nlb/  Competition is positive news for Mysterium and the community as a whole. It further proves the need for better privacy solutions by involving more people and paving way for ever diverse technical solutions - building secure communications. 

From what we see, Orchid is targeting B2C clients, while our long term vision is to create a protocol plugged to a network of nodes, which provide “Privacy as a service” to dApps and Apps as out of the box solution.

As a I’st stage - we’re focused on building Mysterium protocol and mounting it onto the I’st app, releasing to initial set of users with the goal of testing and improving the experience. 

Other differences and chances for collaboration will show with further product development from both teams. We haven’t tried their product thus cannot speak about details. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dvzxk25/  We think Robertas answer above covers this question too:

I am excited to see what we as a team can deliver in the close/far future. We haven't yet finally planned Q2, but we are looking to work with larger pool of developers and also looking to add CMO and CFO to the team preparing for future developments. Also looking forward to product advancements as we are getting ready to open the network to 3rd party Service Providers(Node operators) and 3'rd party apps (currently we are getting ready to release our I'st app - ""Mysterion"")

As for disappointments. We had a tiny team right after the token sale and suddenly we became an organization accountable to thousands, aiming for high goals and a bit confused at some pressing times. Looking backwards I believe we could have set our priorities a bit better, focused on some things less, on some more, but overall I see no big disappointments.

From my perspective I am very happy - that we are becoming an able organisation with a solid initial team, great ethics, first results in product and team building, and etc.. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dw2gur7/  We are not planning to do another token sale. The Timeline on our website will be updated and with the feedback from the pre alpha we will be able to provide the dates for our new Roadmap. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dw0hsry/  Our priority is the network that everyone can later utilize for various uses.

Your comment is reasonable. We have been thinking about various approaches towards network growth, including subsidies. However, it is too early confirm any of the approaches, as we focus to the product functionality at this stage. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dw5ub8l/  - Usual practice is not to run service nodes at home (by residential users). Your ISP may block your internet or get your IP blacklisted, effectively limiting your internet experience.
- As of authorities performing lawful interception everything depends on hosting /  ISP / country policy. You should always be aware of the policy that is being applied by those entities..
- Transports that would be able to bypass certain counties  imposed  limitation should be pluggable to our VPN in the future. Community in need of such transports should be able to implement and adapt to our framework. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/84sptz/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_march_2018/dw5ztsa/  Mysterium Network acts as a marketplace, its Open Source software allows anyone to join the network both as a provider – selling unused network traffic or as a customer –  buying VPN service from other Mysterium Network providers. Cost ot Mysterium services will be defined by the node operators. Since this will create a phenomenon known as ‘perfect competition’ – we expect prices to be significantly lower than of current VPN providers. Exact price setting mechanism is still a subject of future development and will see a series of upgrades over the time and accumulated experience, with aim to meet the market needs.

**Node Testing Telegram group** https://t.me/mysterium_network_nodes ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/98ta64/host_your_own_mysterium_node_to_help_provide_a/e4iidts/  Hi, this is TestNet. When we launch in production you will be able to earn **MYST** tokens for renting your unused network traffic to those in need of a secure connection. Yes, you can set up a **Mysterium node** from anywhere in the world by following the instructions in the guide above. You are welcome to join our Telegram Testing group for assistance if you wish. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/98ta64/host_your_own_mysterium_node_to_help_provide_a/e4j9j9d/  At Mysterium, our goal is to create a protective layer on top of any communication taking place within the new decentralized blockchain ecosystem. This protective layer could be applied to all kinds of communication: be it peers talking over a video chat or nodes communicating important data to each other. 

We are starting with a VPN. Significant milestones for 2018 include VPN clients for key OSes (macOS and Windows have already been released with  Linux and mobile for Android on the way), we opened the possibility for anyone to run a VPN node on our TestNet, development and cultivation of initial partnerships and implementation of payments proof of concept.

From this point we will keep on improving the protocol and network by adding more complexity such as: decentralizing payments, decentralizing discovery, adding multi-hop routing, creating a marketplace of traffic tunneling protocols, and eventually creating a complete End-to-End communication protection, where any App/dApp developers would be able to integrate a secure and virtually unstoppable communication channel right into their app, for any two peers to communicate among each other without any unwanted third party interfering or even knowing that communication took place.

Cost of Mysterium services will be defined by the node operators. Since this will create a phenomenon known as ‘perfect competition’ – we expect prices to be significantly lower than of current VPN providers. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/98ta64/host_your_own_mysterium_node_to_help_provide_a/e4jhmks/  **Mysterium Network, now testing the most vulnerable platform - Microsoft Windows**

Mysterium Network is happy to announce the availability of our VPN TestNet working pre-alpha client for the most popular yet most attacked **Microsoft Windows** operating system.

This pre-alpha release will work on Windows 7 or newer and will use the current infrastructure of Mysterium and community run TestNet servers located worldwide.

Registration is open. All testers will have exclusive access to our Windows VPN Testing Telegram group, no other Windows client support will be available during this testing period.

We also encourage TestNet node administrators to keep the nodes operational during the testing period and report any unexpected behavior.

Registration for Mysterium Network Windows pre-alpha client available immediately. Please fill the **form** here:

Mysterium TestNet is a free VPN testing environment which gives basic security features for internet communication. TestNet, however, is not a production ready system and we appreciate your time testing it and helping us to build this next generation decentralized VPN. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/95ameq/mysterium_network_windows_vpn_testing_begins_on/e3r7esg/  **Popularity Invites Vulnerability: Lack of Privacy in your default Windows installation is just amazing**
https://medium.com/mysterium-network/popularity-invites-vulnerability-lack-of-privacy-in-your-default-windows-installation-is-just-f8bc4c549d2c ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/95ameq/mysterium_network_windows_vpn_testing_begins_on/e42ebm8/  This question is on behalf of Oleg from our unofficial Russian Telegram group:

Could you give us a time estimate for the product and listing on exchanges? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8dd1ex/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_april_2018/dxmyqyg/  Mysterium Network will work by utilizing blockchain technology such as Ethereum, smart contracts advancing their features with state-channels and evolving mechanisms of promises, combined with censorship evasion protocols developed by the community acting as applications of the network.

Mysterium will deploy technological and legal means to make sure node operators are safe:

I’st we will focus on protecting node operators from a legal perspective (we are working on this),

II’nd we will implement an ingrained reputation & trust mechanisms (based on Registered Identities defined in whitepaper) and finally we will develop a traffic routing mechanism which would combine splitting request data through different nodes and changing the end-to-end circuit between requests.

Regarding the security audit, our codebase is open source and everybody is welcome to be a security auditor or adviser, review the code and contribute. But at the certain stages of our product development we’ll do security audits with external security auditors to make sure we provide a secure solution to our clients and community members. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8dd1ex/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_april_2018/dy02poe/  Here are some details about our partnership with IUNGO:

IUNGO and Mysterium Network to integrate their decentralized global WiFi and VPN Networks

Benefits of VPN or how Mysterium Network will enhance IUNGO service

https://medium.com/@iungo/benefits-of-vpn-or-how-mysterium-network-will-enhance-iungo-service-c6292ddbb9d

Also we are in constant research mode, where we analyse potential use cases for Mysterium by other companies/Apps/dApps while getting ready for more active and direct involvement with them in a short while. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8dd1ex/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_april_2018/dy2fans/  Our new **Roadmap** will indicate the milestones and estimated time frames. When we have completed the VPN client external tester feedback it should be ready and will be posted on our website. We continue to work with exchanges and have recently applied for listing to additional ones. As soon as we have a finalized agreement we will announce it. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8dd1ex/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_april_2018/dy0orrn/  At the moment Mysterion is the VPN client which lets access to Mysterium Network for free. It's like a sandbox to conduct testing, plus later it will serve as the documentation, code example of how everybody can build their apps and utilize Mysterium Network. After adding MYST token payments it will serve as VPN app. If anyone has great ideas for useful features, you are welcome to contribute to the Mysterion app repo. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8dd1ex/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_april_2018/dxyjpow/  You can sign up for possible selection to our Pre Alpha VPN testing groups here:

https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfrqlGA2CwEzl24jjHsWC1b6IFcp-H5P6sx5d3j226PYNCgDQ/viewform

We are well into the process of testing the VPN client and have several groups from various countries giving us great feedback, recommendations for improvements and new feature requests. Our developers have already implemented bug fixes, enhancements and are working on the new features for the next builds of the software. 

We intend to bring the app for mobile devices in the future and are focusing on desktop format presently. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8dd1ex/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_april_2018/dxyhcgp/  Yes, we changed them to Reddit AMA sessions recently but will get back to posting some more information on Medium too. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8dd1ex/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_april_2018/dxyj1cd/  There is opportunity for various collaborations and partnerships and that is one of the phases that we will be focusing on. 

From our previous AMA:
""Ultimately I believe we could see services built for crunching data, also Apps and dApps using Mysterium as their secure communication channel between any 2 end points whenever they need one - for example to create a secure communication channel between a user and a server, or a user to another user, or a user and a device. This could be applied to any number of services which need a secure communication channel. For example it could be: payment apps like Paypal, Revolut or any of the wallet apps, communication apps like Snapchat or Whatsapp, e-commerce services such as Shoppify, then content delivery services such as Netflix trying to ensure their users can access content when traveling abroad, etc."" - Robertas Visinskis

We’re working on such approach, but it’s a very slow process as it needs a lot of communication and a lot of resources from both sides. If you will find any other opportunities with whom we could collaborate, please let us know. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8dd1ex/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_april_2018/dy2entb/  We are actually among the most active projects on GitHub as you can see from CryptoMiso Crypto commits https://cryptomiso.com/months_3.html

Always protect your private keys, make backups and make sure to follow official links. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8cond2/mysterium_network_you_can_store_send_receive_your/dxgiu1i/  Hi, we are currently in the second phase of the pre alpha external user testing. We have received great feedback for our VPN client and have applied bug fixes and included requested features and enhancements. We are also in the process of adding additional nodes and testers from more countries. After the VPN client testing we will open up the user hosted nodes for testing as well. Then we will make the API and documentation available for partners, dapps and apps to integrate our services. With the collected feedback from the pre alpha testing we will be able to finalize the dates for our new **Roadmap** and that will give a clear time indication. 

I recommend that you post the question in our monthly AMA as well to receive a response from more members of the team https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8dd1ex/mysterium_network_reddit_ama_april_2018/ ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/8cond2/mysterium_network_you_can_store_send_receive_your/dxm6qqp/  Our 1st Reddit AMA event is listed on https://coinmarketcal.com/?form[coin][]=Mysterium%20(MYST)&form[sort_by]=created_desc&utm_referrer=email ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/83wn7v/1st_mysterium_network_reddit_ama_on_friday_march/dvlv2w8/  Since this is our first Reddit AMA, we will have it open for questions and comments on Friday March 16 and leave it open until at least Monday.

**Installation Guide:**

https://github.com/MysteriumNetwork/node/blob/master/INSTALL.md

**FAQ on How to Install & Operate a Mysterium Node:**

https://github.com/MysteriumNetwork/node/wiki/Node-operation

optional **virtual machine** download - MacOS with installed Mysterion VPN client

Install VirtualBox and then import this virtual machine.
https://yadi.sk/d/Kfa8RA883ZAee3

You will need to have a static IP address for nodes. A domain is not needed as we don’t detect and use it in proposals.

For node to operate you need public IP. At this alpha testing phase we only support nodes operating in hosting servers (on external IPs only).

- I have launched my node with docker. Please tell what’s next?

We are whitelisting alpha node testers to our discovery service. If you are getting 403 it may mean you are not whitelisted yet - send PM with your IP and OS to our Project Manager Andrius @Zygman on Telegram.

- How can I check that it works? 

After node IP gets whitelisted, you should get something like this:

[Mysterium.api] Proposal registered for node: 0x561eddc8c00f42541f50f0d0275f7e34bd92c057

The node (and identity) should be visible in https://testnet.mysterium.network/

You will be able to test tunnel by installing mysterium-client package and use --cli  for command like client.

- Do I need to open some ports in my router?

Yes, if node will be at home then you will need to forward required ports. You need to open at least 1194 (default OpenVpn) port.
You will need to setup forward rule into your local IP address where node runs.

We would like to thank everyone for participating. This is an open group so feel free to invite your friends to join us and host their own nodes as well.

Are you a developer that would like to facilitate the growth of a VPN network which could provide better privacy and anonymity for all internet users? Check out our documentation. We strive to develop a toolkit which would allow programmers to incorporate VPN services into their dApps. We encourage everyone to download the node & client software, try it out and give us your feedback. We are looking forward to your contributions.

http://docs.mysterium.network/en/latest/ ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/abovmn/mysterium_network_developer_documentation_to/ed1y0yv/  About 3000 leading policy-makers, business executives and thought leaders came together with the goal to support the transition from a profit towards a purpose driven economic system.

We are testing **3rd party Mysterium VPN nodes** on TestNet! This is a significant step towards a decentralized, peer to peer based and server-less node network.

Users will be able to run Mysterium VPN nodes on any OS with Docker. As an alternative users will be able to setup VPN node using .deb packages on Debian or Ubuntu. Currently node supports OpenVPN as its underlying VPN transport.

**How to set up a VPN Node**

https://medium.com/@hghg66g77/how-to-set-up-a-mysterium-vpn-node-3034b0d820a3

**Installation Guide:**

https://github.com/MysteriumNetwork/node/blob/master/INSTALL.md

**FAQ on How to Install & Operate a Mysterium Node:**

https://github.com/MysteriumNetwork/node/wiki/Node-operation

optional **virtual machine** download - MacOS with installed Mysterion VPN client

Install VirtualBox and then import this virtual machine.
https://yadi.sk/d/Kfa8RA883ZAee3

You will need to have a static IP address for nodes. A domain is not needed as we don’t detect and use it in proposals.

For node to operate you need public IP. At this alpha testing phase we only support nodes operating in hosting servers (on external IPs only).

- I have launched my node with docker. Please tell what’s next?

We are whitelisting alpha node testers to our discovery service. If you are getting 403 it may mean you are not whitelisted yet - send PM with your IP and OS to our Project Manager Andrius @Zygman on Telegram.

- How can I check that it works? 

After node IP gets whitelisted, you should get something like this:

[Mysterium.api] Proposal registered for node: 0x561eddc8c00f42541f50f0d0275f7e34bd92c057

The node (and identity) should be visible in https://testnet.mysterium.network/

You will be able to test tunnel by installing mysterium-client package and use --cli  for command like client.

- Do I need to open some ports in my router?

Yes, if node will be at home then you will need to forward required ports. You need to open at least 1194 (default OpenVpn) port.
You will need to setup forward rule into your local IP address where node runs.

We would like to thank everyone for participating. This is an open group so feel free to invite your friends to join us and host their own nodes as well.

Merlin2oo2,"For DVM or RVT? For RVT, when I took the state exam, it was open book. Unsure about DVM.I am so sorry for your loss, but appreciate your thoughtfulness. As someone who has worked third shift, food of any kind is very appreciated. Usually the best way to approach it is to divide whatever you’re bringing and labeling it “day” and “night.” For example, a client once brought two cookie cakes with labels and it worked great for making sure day shift knew not to eat night shift’s cookie. Second shift usually mooches off both/either. 😅Many places will hire a vet assistant without a degree. However, if you’re planning to pursue any form of schooling, I strongly recommend skipping the vet assistant programs and going for technician instead. It’s a much better value for your money. 

If you’ve never worked in a clinic before and aren’t 100% sure you want to invest in becoming a tech, getting hired as a kennel assistant is a great opportunity to get a feel for veterinary practice. 

As far as pay goes, honestly…you won’t make good money doing any of those jobs, but you might manage a living wage as a tech if you get your degree and pass your boards.Unfortunately, I don’t have any recommendations. I don’t know of any support staff in vet med who have been able to live comfortably without a second income or help from family. If you’re looking for a good job that pays well, you’ll be hard-pressed to find it as an assistant or technician. I won’t go as far as to say it’s impossible, but it’s simply not a high-paying field.I don’t have any specific relationship advice, but the fact that you’re looking for advice speaks volumes to how much you care about your girlfriend. Some general advice:

- You probably won’t be able to fix anything that she is dealing with (nor should you), and that’s okay. Listen to her, empathize, and offer support that’s meaningful to her (cuddles, wine, ice cream, etc).

- If she’s had an especially shitty shift, do what you can to alleviate her mental load. Make dinner, wash the dishes, start the laundry. Taking some everyday menial tasks off her mind is helpful. Or just offer to get away for a bit to grab coffee or a sandwich together. 

- If she wants to share something cruel or gruesome and you don’t have the mental space for it, it’s okay to speak up and say so. Listen as much as you can. It’s helpful to talk to someone to process things, but you’re her partner, not her therapist (also, I highly recommend therapy for anyone in the caring professions).

- Ask her about the wins or things she’s grateful for at work. It’s easy to get trapped in a cycle of negativity. Don’t minimize the bad things, but do make space to talk about the good things at her job, too. Sometimes after a tough shift, we forget that oh yeah, that super cute parvo puppy that almost died got to go home and the puppy’s family was so happy.","The first comment was from a Medical Doctor, and the second comment was from a person offering advice and support to someone in the veterinary field.

I didn't watch the talk so I'm not sure what your issue is with the RACE-approved veterinary CE lecture on the topic. Did they get it wrong? You may need to notify the AAVSB's Registry of Approved Continuing Education that they've let something slip that is not serious or is somehow inaccurate.I'm not sure why you'd volunteer this opinion. Veterinary CE is filled with topics you may not be interested in, from species you don't practice on to aspects of practice you're not interested in, or topics you're already quite confident in and don't feel the need to sit through a refresher. I know I feel that way quite often.

Is there a particular reason that you felt your lack of interest was worth sharing? Perhaps your opinion goes beyond lack of interest, and you are for some reason hostile to these topics?If you have an issue with any of the content, be sure to contact the AAVSB regarding their approved credit courses. The info is here: [https://www.aavsb.org/contact-us/](https://www.aavsb.org/contact-us/)

If you don't have an issue with the content, I hope you'll speak up against people spreading misinformation implying the content is somehow inaccurate or problematic.Oh interesting, the expert who gave the talk seems to have a different opinion, as does the Tufts Veterinary Nutrition Department (see here: [https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2016/07/vegan-dogs-a-healthy-lifestyle-or-going-against-nature/](https://vetnutrition.tufts.edu/2016/07/vegan-dogs-a-healthy-lifestyle-or-going-against-nature/)). Not to mention, Hill's makes a prescription diet for dogs that is vegan.

You see, veganism describes the food source, but doesn't actually give any information about the ingredients or nutrients. Animal bodies actually need nutrients, not specific origins or ingredients.

With that said, why are you focused on just that one talk? I linked a page of CE with 3 different events, which will continue to be populated with new events each month on a variety of topics. Did you mean to say none of them are useful? Or did you just not notice there are more than one?What nutrient that cats need can't be produced in a vegan way?There are none.

So not kidding, just asking a rhetorical question that you had to either answer incorrectly, or dodge/ignore.Lmao

Feel free to try and answer my question.

Fun fact: the article you shared says that the amino acid makeup of meat can be replicated using vegan sources, as can the proper form of vitamin D.

As you may or sadly may not know, most taurine currently used in cat foods is made from vegan sources purely because it is industrially efficient to do it that way. 

So unless you're just admitting I'm right and you're wrong, why don't you type it out explicitly: one single nutrient that cats need that cannot be produced in a bioavailable form by vegan means.https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/013/094/nuNAS.png","Other.

OdderSpaceOtter,"I got a bachelor’s degree in biology after high school, then later decided to go for a 2-year associate’s degree for vet tech certification before I ever envisioned being a veterinarian. Vet tech is not a first step into being a veterinarian, and most vet techs (like me when I started out) do not have the goal of vet school. I later decided I wanted to become a veterinarian, and my vet school requirements mostly came from my previous biology degree plus a couple of online courses I took while applying to vet school. Only ONE of my vet tech courses counted as a pre-req for vet school. 

As another commenter mentioned, you only need the pre-reqs, not another bachelor’s degree. 

Also, I highly recommend getting more experience working in a clinic before deciding on a career change that requires such a huge mental and financial commitment. There are so many ways to continue in animal welfare aside from the medicine aspect! You could look into jobs with the ASPCA or local shelter/rescue operations.I’m in NC (but not the Triad).

4. Pass boardsThere is no ""best""

1. Banfield - Highly location dependent. I had multiple classmates work there after we graduated and I think only one is still there. She was offered a medical director position straight out of school. They pull you in with salary and signing bonus but can leave you haning.
2. VCA - VERY CORPORATE. I interviewed here and was scared away because there are miles of red tape and you are answering to 40 different people who you have to meet with constantly. Also seem to be pretty stingy in terms of benefits.
3. Vetcor - Worked for a clinic for 2 years. Pretty hands off corporation let us do our thing and didn't bother us. Contract with Idexx was nice for labs. I had a great mentor but I don't think Vetcor has a program per se. Definitely underpay if you don't ask for a good salary up front.
4. NVA - Like Vetcor pretty hands off, no mentorship programs short of finding a clinic that you like. Benefits and pay seem better than Vetcor.120k is a lot of money. I'd go with LSU.

Angepainted,"Depending on the university hospital (location/specialties), it is a great place to advance your skills and work on your VTS.

teriyamawadakhasam,"Thanks Dr. I just feel so stupid and embarrassed to discuss such an issue here since it feels so trivial. But this is just an example. I am in the need of this vehicle since otherwise I'll have to depend on unreliable public transport and the distances between point A to B are too much here.

It's ok though. I didn't expect anything else from such employers.

Edit: Thanks for your understanding. I was afraid I will be blamed for ranting about this issue.Thank you for the opportunity. I'm already involved with a company in BC Canada who are applying for an LMIA and a work visa for me which *most probably* will be completed by the end of this year. 

That said, I would also like to know more about the opportunity your clinic presents for me. I have sent you a dm.I forgot to add this. I am in the process of immigration for restricted licence. It should be completed by the end of this year of everything goes well.Dear Sir,

Regarding a $1000 USD spay, one could opt for the procedure in another city, enjoying a first-class round trip. Your information seems a bit misplaced.

Indeed, vet med costs are high in cities like Bengaluru and New Delhi. I have college juniors (surgeons) working there, where spays range from $180-$360 USD, and orthopedic surgeries can easily surpass $1000 USD, depending on implants.

As for relocating to Bengaluru, if I must move for a better salary, why not choose a place with a higher quality of living, where employers don't exploit vets as personal chauffeurs under the guise of 'Animal welfare'?

Blind nationalism won't solve issues. Acknowledging problems in our judiciary is crucial for progress. I won't be held accountable for issues I'm a victim of.I forgot to add this. I am in the process of immigration for restricted licence. It will be completed by the end of this year.Above is just one example. I have a lot of vets suffering from numerous challenges while a few also enjoy various perks in their jobs.
There's just one kind of job which can provide a comparable satisfaction, and it's the government veterinary services.
No wonder most people leave their private sector jobs to join as govt vet.Being an Indian, the waiting time for mere appointment for a tourist visa is almost 1 year. And I don't think any one would sponsor me for a work visa to US on a vet tech job.If only becoming a government sector vet was that easy. I have been trying for nearly 8 years now. I don't think it's a skill issue given I could clear NAVLE on my first attempt while I couldn't clear the job screening tests here even after nearly a decade. It would be easier if I had a caste based reservation since all my caste benefit batchmates could secure a job within 0-4 years of passing out. Rest, one needs heavy political pull to secure such employments in my state (province). 

My mere frustration with this system lead me to apply to get a vet license outside of this corrupt vicious circle.

And yes, about the pension. There's none now so..So I thought as well. Was in for a rude awakening after getting navle scores.Not much true until you open your clinic in a metropolitan. I have multiple friends who have opened their practice in small states near their homes but they are yet to break even after 2 years of opening. They're paying rents out of their own pockets most of the time.🤷What's the salary for neutered one?

Asking for a friend.This is a very good idea. Thanks OP. I hope this site finds success and is not bought out by major company which then turns it into garbage.Better get a transfer I guess if it falls under ecfvg criteria. Getting your college recognised is tedious from what I hear.

EdenMyers,"So.... back in like, the early Cretaceous when I was in school (not at Purdue) it was very similar. Everyone sleeping with each other were used to after three years of it- students, faculty, faculty spouses- you name a combination, it happened. The insane work load (we were expected to staff the wards overnight in addition to 8am classes AND 12-14 hr days in the clinic) we could deal with.   
The toxic behaviour not so much. My class sued a couple of our profs, I think, and got one thrown out of the classroom for sexual harassment, though he kept his job. So it has been done.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with asking to be called by her title especially when the other docs are. 

Refusing to call her by her title is 100% disrespectful and unprofessional.She earned her doctorate. That is her title. If you can't respect education, the medical field is not for you

Sincerely, the daughter of a nurse who would NEVER disrespect a doc like thatShe earned her doctorate. That is her title. If other docs are addressed by their title, she should be too. 

Yes everyone is valuable, but if you can't respect titles and education, the medical field is not for youShe earned her doctorate. That is her title. End of storyShe earned her doctorate...I think you're being a bit obtuse here and just looking for something to argue about. 

99% of people don't care if you say male and female. If you prefer to be addressed differently, that's great!

But trying to control exactly how everyone talks is simply that... narcissistic control. 

This criticism is extreme, does not help the trans community, and does not add any value to this conversation. 

We can fight for trans rights without nit picking every word people use to generalize genders. The vast majority of people identify as male and female and do not take offense to those terms. Most trans people I know couldn't give less of a shit and wouldn't bat an eye at this. 

This is giving very ""white savior"" vibes.This is my latest hill to die on ever since I heard my alum school
1. Has doubled class size
2. No longer requires entrance interviews 
3. Has trouble keeping staff and students are having to beg for simple bone lectures 

We recently got an email explaining how the curriculum has changed and first years will be getting extern hours (which seems cool) but then went on to say that many students don't have experience working in clinical practice... what? Over 90% of my class (which graduated less than 5 years ago) had tech/assistant experience. We had to have 2 DVM recommendations and hours of experience. 

Meanwhile the 4 tech schools in the state have had absolutely no upgrades or extra funding to combat the shortage. 

So we are now pumping out 200 vets and only 60 techs a year. How do this make sense?!?!?! 

Also urban areas are SATURATED with vets. Blindly increasing class size won't help address the shortage BECAUSE THE SHORTAGE IS IN RURAL AREAS and the pay is too low. 

They keep looking at overall numbers of vets vs pets, but fail to look at distribution and support staff. 

And being less selective and accepting more students than you can teach will only produce below average vets.Being at work in the vet med mentality and being at home without that ""hat"" on are very different. 

I can do 3 euthanasias in one day and not cry, but then see a post on Facebook about euthanasia and sob on my couch. 

You learn how to detach at workI would make sure to get 100% on vet prepCan you share where you get the stats?I'm addition to this I also explain that the immune system can be compromised from stress, including the stress of feeling unwell due to the inflammation itselfI'm confused about the ashes. Vet clinics don't handle ashes, the cremation company does.Yeah idk why there was any push back on thatWe charge if they lose the tags and we have to replace them. But that's a physical cost. I've never charged for a certificate. That's part of the medical record. It should be on file already.I would see if you can defer a year and take a break for your mental health. Plenty of students do that during didactic learning in the first few years. 

I definitely would finish out the degree tho. You're too far in it to throw it away. And like others have said, you can do so much with the degree. 

You may find a practice that you love! I'm assuming you're graduating in the spring or summer. Less than a year to go! You got this!Your clinic should be sending out dosimeter badges to be read on a regular basis. 

You should have your own badge and wear it on top of the lead garmet. 

If it comes back high levels, they ban you from taking x-rays for a year. (I've never seen this happen)15 years ago a house would cost $200,000. Now minimum is $400,000 with high interest rates. 

Don't talk about work ethic when you aren't even keeping up with current economic problems. 

Our student loan costs have also doubled in the last 15 years...You forgot to factor in doubled student loan payments, mortgage, and general cost of living. ALL of those things doubled.You're logic isn't confusing anyone... we just don't agree with you based on opposing factsOkay dude, now your delusional. PLEASE read up more on current costs. 

Do you even know how much vet school costs? Unless you have family money or a job before school, you literally cannot pay tuition and rent without a loan. 

Rent in a college appt is about $700 a month. ($8,400 a year)
3-4 years of undergrad tuition (assuming it's a public) is about $12,000 a year or $29,000 and year out of state. 

That's $20,000 - $37,000 a year on tuition and rent alone.


Now vet school itself (state school) 
Instate: $28,000 a year
Out of state: $57,000 a year

So $36,000- 65,000 on rent and tuition alone during vet school. 


This doesn't even include private university tuition, groceries, supplies, etc. 

And remember, you have to get As in undergrad so you can get into vet school... so you can't work too much. Jobs pay between $8-12 an hour. 

And once you're in vet school you have 2 tests a week. When you're in clinics you work all day. So no outside job. 




A student cannot pay for vet school by simply working a part time job. Loans are essential. We only had 3 people in my class who didn't take out loans. One had a fund from a dead relative. Idk about the others. 

If the vets you know paid off their loans in 3 years... their loans weren't big. They def had family money to help pay tuition. Or they had a career before school. Or it was decades ago when the economy was much different.You realize moving takes money right? Also assuming you want to uproot your whole life and leave family and friends behind. 

You seem to be very out of touch with our current economy. Please take time to listen instead of screaming. 

We don't all have the privileges that you do, particularly as a man (and I'm assuming straight white Gen X by your comments). 

You haven't had to think about a lot of the adversity people face. But that doesn't mean their adversities don't exist. You saying ""just leave. Just move."" Doesn't magically fix it.As an industry consultant it would behoove you to LISTEN and consider the concerns and wants of new grads instead of dismissing them. 

What you view as a poor work ethic is actually better work/life balance. The newer generations have learned that America doesn't care about them and the only ones looking out for them are themselves. That's what the world has taught us over and over. 
Good ole capitalism runs unregulated, the rich get richer and the poor get poorer. 
9/11, Hurricane Katrina, multiple pandemics and recessions have taught us that life is short and we aren't guaranteed tomorrow. 
We can't afford to pay off our loans or house notes because Boomers and Gen X keep voting for politicians that cripple the economy and believe in trickle down economics. 
The minimum wage hasn't changed despite cost of living skyrocketing. 
Social security is running out. 
Healthcare is a privilege and not a right. 
Guns are protected more than people. 
A misogynistic rapist who was impeached TWICE may become president again. 
At this rate, we won't be able to retire until we are 80. 

So while your generation was worked to the bone when you were young and then retired at 55-65 with an affordable house and little debt... millennials, Gen Z, and Gen alpha will be working until we are 80, still paying back loans. 

Work/life balance and adequate pay is not something we have the luxury of waiting for. We are in this for the long haul. And we have no sympathy left to work for less than we are worth. 

And politics can absolutely make a place miserable to live in. The fact that you haven't been affected by it should alert you to your own privilege. 

As an industry consultant, you should learn what your people are going through. Otherwise, you're going to go obsolete real fast. The boomer generation is retiring. Millenials, Gen X, and soon Gen Alpha will make up the majority of the work force soon. Adapt or die.But still white, male, and straight... it's important to remember that people of color, women, and LGBTQ folk have  an even HARDER time pulling up their bootstraps BECAUSE of a lot of politics in your very state. Politics you, yourself seem to support. 

Hence why minorities are reluctant to go to Texas (and work for wealthy white men who vote for policies that directly harm them) 

And yes sir... you essentially had a temper tantrum with a woman, attacking her work ethic. Then with another user talking about your penis.I assumed you were anti-female because of LGBTQ inclusivity reasons, but the fact that this wasn't even inspired by that is a bit strange to me. 

You absolutely did use gighting words with OP and insinuating she was equating humans to dogs.


We're also in the scientific field and are more likely to use scientific words when referencing this. 

Ex: urine instead of pee, female instead of women. 

Never in my life has anyone ever been offended by being referred to as female vs woman. And I went to all all girls high school, was in a sorority, and went to school and work in a female dominated field. 

To berate someone for saying female is absolutely rediculous. 

As far as Google, you can find a lot of misinformation on there. Inflammatory and controversial articles excel there, doesn't mean they are representative of popular opinion. Just look at all the medical misinformation! 

Again, this is more about trying to control every word people sayI'm not denying berating you. 

And yeah, you chose to take your shot and it was flimsy then tried to act like you weren't shooting. 

Let people be and don't worry about controlling their rhetoric. Again, it adds nothing of value to the conversationCheck out the ""For Veterinary Use Only"" and ""Veterinary ECC Small Talk"" Facebook pagesEach corporation is different. You're going to have good and bad changes. 

There is a lot of benefit to having a large company back you up. SVP actually had an initiative where they made the minimum wage for assistants $13 and hour and registered techs $20 an hour. 

The clinic can get deals with drug companies and labs that private clinics can't get 

You now have a network of sister hospitals you can reach out to for help. Like if you run out of something. 

My childhood vet sold to VCA and I remember him saying he loved the fact that he could just come to work, do his job, and come home. 

I later worked at that clinic under VCA and loved it. 

It's really hard to be a business owner and a doctor at the same time. Many people are burning out which is why selling to corporate is so appealing. 

What you need is good leadership during the transition period. Someone who will stand up for yall if a corporate change isn't right.

captSNAX,"For what it’s worth, I’ve had 13 years of experience with Banfield from the other side of the counter and their care and service has had a noticeable decline over the last few years. Enough so that we only took our dog there for routine bloodwork and vaccines because they were included in a care plan that couldn’t be canceled. The last surgery experience was a total nightmare that started with them not having the sedative to put her under on the date of surgery and ended with a tech bringing my 13 yo dog out while still POURING blood from the incision sites and sutures already coming untied. This required no less than 6 follow-ups for post-op care.  My wife was a vet tech for years and I am in biology research, so we kind of knew what red flags to look for. We notice a lot that were similar to what you are describing. That being said, I understand your position. I’m not sure how your field looks at previous practice reputation, but if that is a factor, then I wouldn’t want my name attached to that company. Sterility issues are a big deal and an indicator of attention to detail. Personally, I would hold out for VCA (have had some positive experiences with them) or look for alternatives. Maybe a smaller practice in your area. But I understand the need to acquire experience, so if you do go with Banfield I would keep expectations low and keep an eye out for better opportunities.

CGNAT has many pitfalls especially when port forwarding just google it to find out more.  


many people get 50-100 myst a month as they are based in countries that are popular with streaming services, I find most of my myst comes from business connections even though the price has bottomed out for the whitelisted b2b traffic.

There has been a lot and I mean a lot of new nodes coming up this year and this is better for the expansion of the network but can also dilute the pot for us node runners as we might get less connections to our nodes than we did before due to the availability of nodes available in any selected region.The team is aware of these issues and are actively working to solve them.

It's worth a try.

I will make a github feature request for you, in a few mins just woke u and having my first coffeeSame here like I mentioned above, if people are not sure they should pop on discord and have a chat.I run several nodes via proxmox, each vm then is assigned a vlan that goes to different public ip addresses, works great.

I also run a cluster of proxmox nodes so if one vm goes down it's brought back up again on a different proxmox node (high availability).

Install unattended upgrades to auto update (linux), then it's almost set and forget process.You don't have to keep the default ports (10000-60000).

The idea is that each opened port is a potential client connection and you will never get that many, you could have 10000-15000 on one vm and 15001-15100 on another.

Just remember to set the port values you have chosen in the dashboard as well as the router.Proxmox is a virtualisation platform that you can create several virtual machines and containers, think of a vm or virtual machine as a device or computer and having them all on one server.

If you have 1 or more external ip addresses in my outer I assign each external ip address or isp uplink (separate Internet connections) and assign them to separate vlan's (virtual networks) and each vm on proxmox in the networking tab I set to a separate vlan, this way each vm has its own external ip address (public ip addresses).

This works for MYST NODES and not the vpn client software.

If your running a myst node your likely to also be running honeygain, peer2profit etc and other validator or crypto nodes and you can assign each the the separate vlans you created for each uplink or external ip address.

That is the basics of my setup, I have old enterprise servers that I am gradually upgrading, fall over routers/switches, etc on my production network.

It all depends on how much you want to get into it, having 1 server instead of multiple servers or devices is a great idea not only in outlay costs but maintenence and upgrading..

Hope this helpsYou could run a vm with portainer or whatever and host all the nodes that way.Polyscan, on the polygon network.
Mysterium used the polygon blockchain (lower fees etc).

Then use coinbase, kracken, etcUse quickswap to swap.
https://quickswap.exchange

To swap to other tokens on the polygon blockchain, then transfer to exchange and cashout to you bankI use metamask for myst with hardware wallet connected to it so I have no idea.

With metamask, if you transfered to your wallet public address its still there, under that wallet you just switch the blockchain to polygon it should show up.

I made this mistake when I first started with crypto.

I have not used your wallet so I have no idea of its capability or settings.

If you try switching the blockchain in that wallet account and let me know what happens finger's crossed🤞you get it back.Just to follow up, did it work or have you lost it?Sorry to hear that about the support, I do know it takes to to get back to emails.

Discord is the main support mostly by community wizards (people that help others like me).

Personally I am going to be more active on this platform, so I can help people, If I can not answer a question I will consult other wizards and the mysterium team that I have contacts with..

In short the support on this platform will be expanded soon by myself and other like minded peopleI run one off my phone, its abit buggy at the moment as it freezes and put your node offline, also public data isn't available yet.

I have to check mine twice a day (or more) to make sure it's running still.

If you're installing it you have to change battery optimisation and allow it to run in the background (permissions), so it doesn't stop running when the lock screen comes on.The leader board is bugged there working on a solution.

I have ran 4 nodes for over a year and this year the rewards went down because of a large amount of nodes been onboarded, I am glad to see new business partners coming to the network and also mysterium opening to the subscription market both of these have seen the revenue increase in recent months.

They have plans for crypto payments coming to the dark app soon so that they can open up to more users on the network.

I am also happy to see split tunneling on the way as well.

These are the things I like to see with the scalability of mysterium, as the community grows and opening into new markets I am very bullish about mysterium.1. What is you're QA (quality assurance) policy, the v2.0 bugs are hammering mysteriums reputation.
.
2. Maybe pause the v2.0 rollout and service while the bugs are sorted out, keeping it in production is hurting the reputation as above.
.
3. Setup if not already an open beta/testing program for major updates like v2.0
I know people will want to join it, I would.
.
3. Phone end node (android), app freezes on the UI screen, you have to close and the background process and reopen th app. 
.
4. Start using YouTube live for ama and community calls, discord and redit are awful platforms for this, I would like to see your faces (if I can get spare time to attend these AMA's).
.
5. Would like to see a historic collection of AMA's as I keep missing them and would like to catchup later when I have time.
.
6. You should really check vpn users ip reputation to limit the amount of malicious actors using mysterium vpn.
Possibly put some checks inplace to limit the amount of risk for end node runners.
.
7. People are complaining about been recognised by streaming services as a vpn, I do not know how you would stop this apart from limiting steaming connections to nodes at any moment in time to say 2 connections to netflix and moving others to another node in that region, the streaming services are not stupid and could save ip addresses to see howmany accounts are accessed by an ip in a time frame (days) to recognise ip addresses as a vpn so i do not know the solution to this one.
.

Mysterium is a great project, I really see alot of potential here.You can also port forward port 22 and use the cli commandsLike a white lable vpn reseller?
Or a reseller with api?The use a ip look up tool that sees the type of public ip address that's registered to itAs stated above it spreads over nodes in a region to keep up speed, latency etc it also allows lesser producing end nodes to earn more and makes it more fair for them.

What is you're QA (quality assurance) policy, the v2.0 bugs are hammering mysteriums reputation.
.
2. Maybe pause the v2.0 rollout and service while the bugs are sorted out, keeping it in production is hurting the reputation as above.

3. Setup if not already an open beta/testing program for major updates like v2.0
I know people will want to join it, I would.

3. Phone end node (android), app freezes on the UI screen, you have to close and the background process and reopen th app.

5. Would like to see a historic collection of AMA's as I keep missing them and would like to catchup later when I have time.
.
6. You should really check vpn users ip reputation to limit the amount of malicious actors using mysterium vpn.
Possibly put some checks inplace to limit the amount of risk for end node runners.
.
7. People are complaining about been recognised by streaming services as a vpn, I do not know how you would stop this apart from limiting steaming connections to nodes at any moment in time to say 2 connections to netflix and moving others to another node in that region, the streaming services are not stupid and could save ip addresses to see howmany accounts are accessed by an ip in a time frame (days) to recognise ip addresses as a vpn so i do not know the solution to this one.

Mindless_Explorer_51,"I chose to go to a ""slapdash rickety ass"" distributive model school and am very happy about that decision years later. Especially after having done a residency at a massive well-known ag school with a large teaching hospital. Comared to my classmates, what I saw was students at the big vet school were quite sheltered and behind us in clinical development, and by the end of 4th year they were still being coddled and needed handholding. Probably not like that everywhere, but yes at this particular school based on my experience. There were also many problems causing some of the mainstay services like IM and Sx to completely shut down for weeks at a time. So while there are many benefits to being at a well established school, going to a distributive vet college (well, at least the school I went to) was an overall great experience and I came out having spent plenty of time in clinics all over the place, and not just one single teaching hospital. Downvote away.

I don't know much about Mark Cushing. Sleazebag or not he does seem to be very knowledgeable about the pet industry and has his fingers in many aspects of the profession, not just setting up vet schools. Probably saw an opportunity there and pounced on it. Now he's making waves in the profession. That thing about Eleanor Green flip-flopping is hilarious though. Cushing must have been very convin$ing.

So what tangible actions are you proposing? Looks like there are a lot of voices here feeling helpless about where the profession is going. Empower us.I did an internship with VCA. They had a dedicated therapist who met with me virtually once a week DURING MY SHIFT so my supervisors knew that every week no matter what I would step out and touch base with her for 45 mins.

Just_Wish_110,"I was a Banfield practice manager for 7 years. We have a tool we use to help us build interview guides. A lot of the questions are similar but asked in different ways. I would expect:

-based on the function of this position name 2 skills you consider to be strengths and give examples of how you use those strengths

-what is one skill you want to improve or develop (I’d pick a soft skill, not a technical skill)

-tell me about a time your knowledge or skills were pushed far beyond your current capabilities

-tell me about a time you had to deal with someone who was challenging to work with. What was the situation and how were you able to maintain a positive relationship (or not.)

-tell me a time you seized an opportunity and ran with it. Why did you do it, what was the outcome?

-tell me about a time your listening skills helped you to diffuse a situation.

All the questions will ask you to describe a situation or tell a story. Think of examples and anecdotes from your career, even if they aren’t vet related. You might get some medical care related questions but they shouldn’t be any “gotcha” questions. Don’t stress yourself out.

NiranS,"Do whatever helps your brain understand the case.  I don't usually make a list of differentials(unless the case is difficult) . Most plans end up being the same, blood work, +/- radiographs. etc.... Exploring the differentials involve the same steps. I will get a better idea , once I get some diagnostics back.

I type my history before starting  my exam. In a perfect world this would have been done even before the owners walk into the room.

I type everything down. Lacking social skills - I might fall into that category. I do spend less time talking to people as I am trying to do the exam , finish my notes, plan etc... I do not really talk during the exam - this is my thinking time. But, when I am done, I will go through what I have found , what my plans are, why I am thinking that way and I will try to send relevant information via email. 

 I find that owners appreciate the time that you take to explain everything.

As for not writing things down, that seems crazy. I do not have that kind of memory any more. It also seems like a good way to lose information.There is some good advice here. Feeling less than brilliant is normal in vet school - everyone is smart. After >25+ years in practice, I am sure I have forgotten a lot of what I learned, as it does not play a huge roll in clinical practice. 

What is your study practice like ?

[https://cse.buffalo.edu/\~rapaport/howtostudy.html](https://cse.buffalo.edu/~rapaport/howtostudy.html)

(generally good advice , except the bit about trying to write notes rather than understand them. If you have good notes going into class, understanding them is better). 

Reading before class for a better understanding (wish I did this. I always felt overwhelmed)

AI voice dictation/transcription software is crazy good. This may be a good way to summarize notes + faster than typing. 

Break notes down and reflect where the knowledge may be useful in a clinical setting (I wish they taught this way). This is very hard to do in first year because of the lack of background.  But, in anatomy - what are the pokey bits I can feel ? What are the nearby muscles and nerves ? This puts anatomy in a more concrete context. 

It gets easier when you can relate what you have learned to actual cases. This puts the knowledge into context. Once again, I wish vet schools taught this way(knowledge floating without contexts is so hard to recall). ie:  This dog is lame. What are the clinical signs? What can you see, and feel - heat , swelling, differential weight bearing, What tests can you apply to narrow down your diagnosis. 

This may see overwhelming at first, especially in first year when your are given so much stuff. But, you will learn it. If you can give your knowledge some context, you might learn it better.Client emotions.You are doing a lot of work. This should not be discounted.

 That aside, when I had a massive drop in energy levels it was because I had sleep apnea. Has your GP tested the usual suspects , iron.deficiency, B12,thyroid,  cardiac, sleep apnea, depression?

If you have not listened to the Huberman podcast, it is worth  a listen for an understanding of health related, exercise, longevity issues from a science perspective.How motivated are you about learning clinical practice ?  Will having clinical experience make you a better regulatory vet? Do you need to see patients on a part time basis as a regulatory vet or is this just choice. ? 

I think there will be a huge shift towards sustainability in the a world of climate change and reducing the input cost of raising cattle. This industry will have to get very efficient or very expensive. Food security and sustainability will become extremely important.I could have written this post myself.

Break this down even further
- what is it about vet med that appeals to you
+ what aspects of vet med would you prefer, behaviour, orthopaedics etc...
- is it working with animals, working on medical puzzles?
+ possibly not dealing with people (lots of people in both fields, lots of emotions)
+ break down the reason why you prefer vet med over medicineI have only had good experiences with nurses and doctors.As a student, I saw a pediatrician examine a gorilla baby. Makes sense as he was the doctor with the greatest experience with the species at hand d.This is always hard. I have done my job when I have provided the best care that I can. Owner compliance, and the outcome is out of my hands. My emotional involvement ends at providing medical care and guidance for the end of life decisions anything more, means I won’t be able to help the next patient.At 8 months out you are doing very well.

In a proper workplace, techs are supportive and have your back.Let management know, their response will tell you if it  is something more systemic.>But I recently got told by an advisor that I don't have a path in life and why don't I just go get an MPH instead? 


What the heck does mean ? ... I don't have a path in life..
I don't have one either and Ive been in practice for 27 years.

Does it mean you have no goals ? I would have to disagree. 
- You had a career before vet med, and you know you did not want to do that
- You know you don't want to do clinical work. Great don't waste more energy and time feeling like you are missing something.
>I'm only interested in wildlife, exotics, pathology, research, one health, the stuff that 99%
+ Nice, less competition and you have narrowed your focus of interest.
- This is not a choice that someone ""who has no path "" follows
- Support.**Is there anyone else you can talk to that is pursuing the things that you are interested in**
- I think the intersection between climate change, and public health will be more important.
- I also think you will have to find support from outside an institution geared towards creating clinicians

I think you should be commended for not following the usual route of clinical medicine and have given some thought to what you want to do.Any possibility of talking to zoo vets ? or Wildlife/zoo vet associations. Any possibility of getting summer work / volunteer work at a zoo? Are there any wildlife research projects at your university ? Anything Wildlife adjacent, like  the biology department (not ideal, but depends on how much wildlife experience you have). Do you have to stay at your institution if you are looking for summer work. I know you are  only in second year, but maybe look at the possibility of doing a zoo/wildlife internship during fourth year. What is it about Wildlife medicine that excites you ? Are there any clinical experience that could come close - Bison/elk husbandry etc...

Goals and plans are overrated. Your councillor telling you, you don't have a life path is less than useful advice.  Look at systems thinking./ [atomic habits](https://jamesclear.com/atomic-habits) What things would you need to do today or on a regular basis to learn more about wildlife medicine/public health etc...

This is a ChatGPT answer but it encapsulates what I was trying to say:

## Experiences to Help Become a Wildlife Vet

### Wildlife Rehabilitation Internships
- Engaging in internships with wildlife rehabilitation centers provides direct exposure to the care, treatment, and rehabilitation of injured, orphaned, or sick wild animals. This experience is invaluable for learning about the unique challenges of wildlife medicine.

### Research Projects
- Participating in research projects related to wildlife health, conservation, and disease can offer insights into the scientific underpinnings of wildlife veterinary medicine. Look for opportunities with universities, conservation organizations, or governmental agencies.

### Volunteer Work
- Volunteer with local, national, or international wildlife conservation organizations. This could include hands-on work in the field, such as habitat restoration, wildlife monitoring, and conservation projects, which can provide a broader understanding of the ecological contexts in which wildlife vets operate.

### Externships with Wildlife Veterinarians
- Seek out externship opportunities with experienced wildlife veterinarians or at zoos, wildlife parks, or conservation projects. These placements can offer direct mentorship and the chance to observe and assist in the medical treatment of a wide range of wildlife species.

### Continuing Education
- Attend workshops, conferences, and seminars focused on wildlife medicine and conservation. These events are great for learning from leading experts in the field, networking with professionals, and staying up to date on the latest research and techniques.

### Certification Programs
- Consider enrolling in certification programs related to wildlife medicine and conservation. These programs can provide additional specialized knowledge and skills that are directly applicable to a career as a wildlife veterinarian.

### Networking
- Build relationships with professionals in the field through networking events, professional associations (like the Wildlife Disease Association or the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians), and social media platforms. Networking can lead to mentorship opportunities and information about unpublished internships or job openings.

### International Opportunities
- If possible, look for international volunteer or internship opportunities. Working with wildlife in different regions can offer a broader perspective on global conservation issues and the role of veterinarians in addressing them.

### Academic Courses and Electives
- Make the most of your veterinary curriculum by taking electives or courses focused on wildlife health, exotic animal medicine, epidemiology, and conservation medicine.

### Self-Learning
- Stay informed about wildlife health issues, conservation strategies, and veterinary medicine advancements by reading scientific journals, following relevant organizations on social media, and joining relevant online forums and discussion groups.Never had communication class. I see your name is Bill, mind if I call you Joe?\>Im running away by trying to secure a gov job that doesnt require vet skills and is more of an office jobs. Higher salary, less demanding, and more time (and capital) for me to focus on building my own business. But ill lose the ability to be a vet 

What do your really want to do ?

There is nothing wrong with working on a different skill set, for a higher salary ,and building a different business. At the end of your life, you will not care if you worked as a vet or not. But, did you do work that you cared about. Where you there to support your family, enjoy your kids growing up.

Are you driven to work as a vet ? Or do you feel obligated because of the education?

If you are running away because of imposter syndrome -literally everyone feels this way. My stomach never stopped churning for the first 5 years of practice. As other posters have mentioned, find a clinic where you can get support and a mentorship.The rest is practice, learning, taking good notes. I would have killed for a service like Vin.com in my early years. It is still a livesaver now. Since we are using computers in the exam rooms now(hasn't even been a year since the paper disappeared), I have my notes and Vin at my fingertips.

Good luck with whatever direction you choose.The answer is not that important. How do you get to the answer. Ask lots of questions about that.Sorry for your current situation. This clinic is operating horribly. I hope you find a place where you can develop your skills rather than compensate for bad management. The sooner you leave, even if you do not have another job lined up, the better.Lot of great answers. Glad your dog did okay.  For spays, make sure you have a good light source. As my eyes are older, I really like eye loupes and magnification. I also like double ligating with Miller’s knots.What part of vet med appeals to you ?Break the skills down into manageable chunks. What specifically do you need to learn? What part of physical exams do you need to improve? Do you have a system of physically examining the patient? As for getting specific feedback in techniques, ask the techs. Hey, what are you placating for on this blood draw etc… You can break any skill down into small manageable steps. I wish they would,d teach stuff like this in school. But don’t be afraid to ask, what specifically are you feeling for, or how did you come to that conclusion, especially when you disagree.what are the specific thought process, findings etc…that would lead a conclusion? How does that compare to your own thoughts? Do you need to improve your understanding.? What do you need to understand better. If it is overwhelming- pick just 1 or 2 things to improve upon.
.

As for vet school. I too did not do so great  from a technical standpoint. I came from a research background before vet school and my classmates had way more practice in animal handling and clinical skills. So, I felt inadequate. In the end it is a matter of practice. You will get there . What you think you know now will be improved and honed in practice, especially in the first 5 years.

Being kind and empathetic is no small accomplishment and will serve you well as a clinician.Do not downplay this skill.","Other. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Other"" as it does not provide any information related to medical or veterinary practice, making it",Other
agirlwhowaited,"As someone who’s worked as an assistant/tech with many vets, I would NEVER call a vet by their first name unless they had specifically asked me to. You worked hard for your title and deserve respect if you are giving it to them. I’ve unfortunately worked with a lot of know-it-all colleagues who think they know more than seasoned vets, most of us see right through it but it doesn’t make them any easier to work with.Yes this is a good point! I don’t think any students have graduated from the full program yet so I’m curious if they’re on track to finish their PhD in 4 yearsThank you! And yes doing the PhD with residency would be a back up plan, doing the dual degree is preferable for me with the tuition waver as an OOSI haven’t been accepted to vet school yet! Still waiting to hear! But I’d be happy to chat with you about why I want to go this route. Congrats on your acceptance!The website actually details that the PhD portion is three years. But that just seems SO fastI am not a veterinarian (vet tech in the process of applying to vet school), but I’ve worked with lab animals for several years and perform the euthanasias myself. It can be hard, and I struggled initially, but eventually you learn how to cope. Fortunately, I’ve seen enough positive research results that help to justify the practice and foster an appreciation for the necessity of animal models. 

There are still the occasional cases that get to me, and I think it is healthy to allow yourself to feel these losses to a certain degree, as you don’t want to become entirely desensitized. We all came into the career because we love animals, it’s natural to feel distress at times- learning healthy coping mechanisms is essential. The animals are always under anesthesia or sedated prior, so in most situations the experience is not traumatic for the animal. It is also helpful to have supportive staff/management- I know this isn’t always common in vet med, but it is truly helpful when there is collaboration and attention to compassion fatigue.In four years you’ll still be four years older, so might as well pursue what you want to do. I’m almost 27 and haven’t been accepted into vet school yet, but still trying.I’m on my third cycle with a less than stellar GPA and have yet to get accepted anywhere. I have 15,000+ hours in various different vet fields including research experience and publications. My advice to you since you’re living at home would be to work to improve GPA. 

I’m in the process of taking post bac classes to improve GPA and it is taking a really long time, with how competitive vet school has gotten I don’t think my experiences will ever outweigh someone with moderate experience but higher gpa. It may, but is unlikely. 

There are other fields you can pursue to make more money and still stay within the realm rather than working as an assistant in GP. Depending on what your degree is in, you could do pharmaceuticals, research, lab animal. You could also leave the field entirely so you can make more money, and use your free time to volunteer/shadow to gain additional vet experience.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Granola bars, nut bars (though I knew that was safe because they had a giant jar of peanut butter out while I was there and you could smell it through the whole clinic) single serve seasonal fruit (ie: apples, oranges, pears, whatever is in season and will keep.) I bought a bunch of those little fruit gummy mini packs you put into kid lunches, single serve popcorn packs, single serve chips, single serve snacks that were gluten free (I think they were like yoghurt topped rice crackers in different flavours?) anyway, you get the gist, a bunch of single serve snacks, i used thick cardstock to make dividers (because AuDHD) I also found a metal tin of fun sized candy bars that fit perfectly at the end (I wanted something with a lid so wandering noses couldn’t get into it by accident) and added things like lollipops and I found a really fun box of cool stickers online that said “Pawfect!” And finished it off with a pen holder that had 25 really nice to write with (but not pricey because I bought them in bulk) pens and two dozen HB pencils with erasers on the end of them in it. I think all up it cost me something along the lines of $40? But I didn’t have to buy the basket and pen holder and the tin, as I already had them. 
It was kinda just a refuelling station for them. That was 7 years ago and they still have it (and they keep it very well stocked!!) ^.^ I see it any time they post photos of their staff area.

T_SlaterWitchLocator,"It depends. New client with a complicated situation or a second opinion, I'll chat to them and get a history first, then examine and refine my questions while looking at the animal. Something not so serious, will start exam while chatting. Depends a bit on how full the waiting room is too...

If there's a lot of info I'll start typing notes up in shorthand while talking to the client and then brain-dump everything after I've finished with them. Remembering all the details gets better with practice.

Zahhhhra,"You’re only 20. Imo look for a better paying job in human medicine. You can go volunteer with animals in your free time.To add context to my comment, I’m a recent animal science graduate that found 2 jobs post college, none of which would pay a livable wage. The first one was 19/h which is at least somewhat livable (maybe lol) but the second was 16.50 💀💀 they expect you to sell your soul to the devil for this job, yet I was told by many technicians at my former job that they are expected to do far more than a regular human nurse. 

In my opinion, physician assistant or nursing sounds great if you don’t want to pursue med school. Nursing is great because you start out with a decent pay after acquiring a 4 year degree and there is room for growth if you want to pursue higher education. 

And this is just my personal opinion again, but I find that most people in vet med don’t actually respect animals as much as you’d think or their passion sort of dies out once they have to live the everyday life. They are so overworked and underpaid and expected to keep up with everything from rude clients to those who don’t want what’s best for their pets to animals they simply can’t help to euthanasia and just a whole other lot of concerns. That’s honestly mostly why I walked away. You try to convince yourself that you’re okay with the pay but at the very least, you don’t even get respect for your otherwise very difficult job. 

Unless you’re 1000% sure this is what you want and you won’t get the same (if not better) fulfillment working with animals outside of your daily job, explore other medical fields first before you commit.Tbh if you’re willing to go to vet school, just go to med school instead. I began college as a pre med and ended it as a pre vet. But if there was a part of me that was passionate about human medicine I would have 1000% done that instead. You get far more money and respect for your work. You don’t have to kill your patients and you can call the child protective services if someone is deliberately holding off medical treatment for their children. You can truly advocate for your patients and the law will be on your side because your patients are human beings and not animals (who have the same right as a handbag as far as the law is concerned). 

There’s so much to note here but the bottom line is: if you like medicine and you enjoy working with humans, attend med school or some other health profession that will pay you far more for your work anyway. Just look at nursing lol 4 year degree lands you a well paying job right off the bat.You know the part about 8/hour? That’s how much assistants get paid.

No_Bake_8038,"See if you can do mobile euthanasia with Hospice. I did home euthanasia for 1.5 years and was about 1 year out of school. It certainly made me a very empathetic vet and less judgmental of clients who cannot afford gold standard or even bare minimum for a sick pet because of their home life. I would  recommend pairing it with GP so it doesn't feel like all you do is euthansia. I would also say that clients are sooooo grateful for the service. You truly become part of the client family when you go onto their home and offer this service. It takes away all the cynical aspect of vet med. Female, Virginia. Small Animal GP 4 years out. Started at 95k with 30k sign on and 19% production in 2021 with a 4/4 schedule. Then switched to 4/3, salary was 120k in 2022 and then130k, 20% production in 2023. I've had enough of corporate GP shenanigans and switched to a 3/2 part time schedule making 118k/yr, still same production. I also do part time(4hr/ 1-2 days a week) relief surgery at a low cost clinic and get paid $600/shifr. I dont mind the rate since I get mentoring from the older surgeon and added a bunch of  surgeries/newer techniques to my belt. Recently I was offered a 2day/ week (12hr/day) shift at a urgent care clinic for $80k and I am debating whether of not to accept it. I was offered a 150ka yr gig in south Fl with a primate breeding/supply company. the operation felt a bit iffy and I didnt take it for various reasons. I would love to go to lab animal academia as I dont see myself in SA GP forever. Did you do a residency in Lab Animal? I would love to work with the fed govt just for benefits.21% production after 6months of working there. You have to meet the same standards that US vets have to follow and show you can meet the needs of US pet owners.  Unfortunately, standards for vet education are not the same abroad. There was a study done that showed navle pass rates are way lower for foreign educated test takers. 
That said, once you meet those hoops, then its smooth sailing. Usa:midline.had a shelter prof once unsuccessfully demo a flank spay. She could not get the second ovary out and had to close that incision and reopen again at midline. I feel for the poor kitty who had to undergo two procedures.Dont go into ER as a new grad.Exactly. You are making life and death decisions in a short span of time. Also you are thrown into the deep end and expected to work with the same experience level as a seasoned ER vet. Its different if you have some hand holding as a rotating intern. But going from 4th year into ER is a sure way to burn out. 

I had a new grad ER vet who diagnosed a 5/6 murmur in a 12 week GS puppy that presented for acute diarrhea.they tell owner dog has pda and surgery has to be done asap. They even misinterpret the chest Xray saying there was cardiomegaly. owner starts freaking out convinced was going to die. She even blasted pdvm online for missing murmur during vaccine appt. Dog did not have a murmur or pda when the cardiologist evaluated the dog!Start with urgent care and work your way up.I only prescribe Metronidazole if there is an overgrowth of clostridial spores on a fecal smear and the pt is symptomatic.
All knots for uterine body, ovarian pedicles and spermatic cord are Modified Millers for both dogs and cats. Skin closed intradermal
Dog neuters are with scrotal incision and walking sutures subQ. 
Cat neuters are instrument tie aka auto ligation

Suture material- pds 2-0 or 3-0 depending on size of organ.I have found sweet spot in relief. I use indeed, look up clinics in my area and reach out to them if I am interested. When I switched from a locum role to full time, I found that the staff/management changed tone in a negative way and there was a lot of non medical drama that was a big distractor. 

The clinic I enjoy working has a collaborative dvm environment, where doctors are not caught in staff pettiness. I like having my own space- computer where I can research cases between appts. Banfield has the worst set up where there is no doctor space and every one shares computers and its a chaotic mess. I think 30min appt are fine since the first 10-15min is history and staff prep for the appointment.

Equity does not matter much. In this field, we are short on men🤷‍♀️

Non competes suck. Trying to force your DVM to get the owner to buy *your fave brand*specialized pet food cos you have a deal with the food company is a big no no in my book.

Staff management interaction should not be brought to the treatment floor. Management should be proactive and anticipate short falls in coverage and come up with ways to stop overburdening staff who are not calling out and leaving their colleagues stranded. I find practice managers to be the biggest roadblocks especially when they lack management skills and make their staff miserable. I will walk out of a clinic if a PM has made decisions creating a toxic envt for the staff and  if this trickles up to the DVM.Followed by retention bonus so the long term vets now visibly pissed wont leave!A lot of vets are hesitant to use hydromorphone since it is a pain to purchase. Torb is weaker than Hydro but effective for an outpatient procedure. I have used Torb and Hydromorphone on pts for spays and pts have woken up comfortably with either drug. I also make sure they get a full dose lidocaine line block at the incision site. The only time the patient woke up agonizing in pain was when the tech forgot to give the lidocaine line block. 

I agree dentals are cookie cutter and find it alarming they insist on dentals starting at 1 year of age! Some of your comments are a little exaggerated esp with techs having to pull blood or place catheters. Isn't that a technicians job? 
There are some well run Banfield clinics and there are some shit shows. The ones in Petsmart are terrible.Its not the corp who creates bottlenecks. I have had my 222 sent back because there wasnt a full stop at the address line and didnt match what the dea had on their records as the clinics address! It added 3 more months to getting hydro into my hands.Wow!  I would quit the field after such torture. No wonder ER vets are hard to find.The best indicator of your navle score are the ivsa practice tests that cost 50 bucks each. If you score above 425 on those tests, your chances of passing the navle are high.I projected 510 to 620 on my final icva test and scored a 530 on navle. Those tests are pretty reliable. So chances of you passing are high. Good luck!I think people overthink the exam at these clinics. They basically just want you to do the exam to ensure the pet is healthy at that time to receive the vaccines and other preventatives. Nothing more. You can certainly talk to owner about ear issue and skin issue or murmur heard and have them follow up at a full service clinic. As long as you document it in the record. When I did Vetco, I always made sure I had access to the patient record and was able to put in my observations and recommendations. I also liked that they did not charge for inj Benadryl and you could give every patient a shot if you wanted. They also do not see pets that are potential vaccine reactors and have them sent to full service.

The vaccine clinic I had a problem with was Shot Vet where they had the intake person putting in the medical record and you were just handed whatever vaccines were drawn up. I had no way of knowing what was the patients history, prev vaccinations given etc.i did only one shift with them and did not want to risk my license after.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

RoseFeather,"I don’t think you were wrong. I’m strongly against elective declawing, but you didn’t recommend that. Removing just the specific digits that are causing the cat discomfort is a completely different situation and these clients obviously weren’t listening to what you actually said. If it were me (assuming I had a say in these decisions) I’d respond to any reviews they’ve made with the facts of what actually happened, then send them their records and tell them to never come back. Fuck these idiots.

If the clients can keep up with trimming the nails often enough to prevent recurrence then that would be my first choice, but removing the non-functional and problematic extra dewclaws is absolutely something I’d present as an option if I saw a similar case.The ones who don’t tell you immediately what they do are the good ones. You don’t find out what they do for a living until it’s relevant to the specific thing you’re discussing or you happen to find the information elsewhere. So a lot of the time you probably just never know.

I had one pretty awesome client I’d seen many times over a period of several months with different pets, a couple of them seriously sick, and only found out when someone googled him (because he has a similar name to a local chiropractor) that he’s actually an MD. Had no idea.I’m a vet with hyperthyroidism, and I still listen to my endocrinologist explain everything like she normally would because I don’t know if or how humans are different. I actually don’t know if she knows what I do, and that’s fine.Depending on your local laws you might need to become a licensed veterinary technician. You’d also have to work under a veterinarian because all (legitimate and useful) dental cleanings in animals are done under anesthesia. The technician’s job is to do the cleaning and polishing but also taking the radiographs, monitoring anesthesia (ideally there will be 2 involved so one can focus on anesthesia while the other does the other stuff, but that isn’t always the case), and taking care of the patient before and after the procedure. Most GP vet offices won’t be doing enough dentistry to justify hiring someone only for that, but there are specialty practices that only do dentistry you could look into if you happen to be near one.

And because it’s all over the internet I need to mention that “anesthesia-free dentistry” in dogs and cats is a scam and harmful to patients. I’m not talking about regular tooth brushing at home, but people who claim that scaling the visible tooth crowns only and not polishing them afterward is equal or even preferable to doing it right. Keep in mind too that by the time the owners start paying attention to the teeth there’s usually already some degree of significant periodontal disease, which obviously doesn’t go away just from cleaning the crowns. Hopefully with your background you’d already know better, but just in case don’t fall for it.Don’t go into detail about why you’re turning it down. If the specifics of the offer being different would make you reconsider (eg higher pay or more benefits) you can try to open up a negotiation. Otherwise, just express your gratitude and respectfully say you aren’t interested, you’ve decided to accept a different offer, it’s not a good fit, etc. It’s just business, so be polite and respectful to avoid burning any bridges but don’t worry about hurting their feelings. You won’t.

When I turned down an offer years ago I thanked them for the offer and said something like “I don’t feel that this position is the right fit for me at this stage of my career.” I was a new grad and they weren’t going to be able to provide the level of mentorship I needed- but I didn’t say all that when I was rejecting the offer. Then I finished by thanking them again for taking the time to interview me and letting me spend time at the practice.That’s what I was thinking about the euthanasia complaint too. Where I work, once the doctor and client have decided that euthanasia is the next step we get the consent paperwork and payment done at the same time, before proceeding. It’s never raised any eyebrows from clients and none of the staff feel awkward about it. It’s not presented as “you must pay first or we won’t do it,” but as “let’s get this part done now so you can just focus on your pet, and once you’re ready to leave you won’t have to do anything else here first.”

Even if they can pay in private instead of the lobby, it still seems wrong to do it afterwards considering that people’s emotions tend to come out even more after the pet is deceased.Even without kids, 4th year rotations were the hardest part of vet school by far and came with my lowest lows of the whole program. They just suck and I’m in awe of my classmates who did all of it with a family. I’m also happy to say that the clinical rotation experience was not at all representative of what it’s like to work in real-world general practice. It gets so much better. And as others have said there are a lot of directions you can take a career with this degree, so if clinical practice isn’t for you you still won’t have wasted your time.

At this point, I think it would be the better long-term option to finish out your degree, but it sounds like you need some help or a break to make that manageable. Would it be possible for you to defer for a semester or even just the length of a rotation or two to take time for your mental health before you finish? Or are there any school counseling services available?Oh, I’m sorry I missed that in your post. Definitely still talk to someone at the school if you haven’t already. They want you to succeed and will do what they can to help you make it through. I had at least 2 classmates who nearly didn’t finish their 4th year for different reasons and they were both supported and helped to make sure they graduated. You don’t need to be perfect. “Good enough to pass” is fine and the most a lot of people are able to manage sometimes.

Your husband will also need to take on the bulk of the workload at home at least during the more demanding rotations to make it possible and stop you from having to “fight” to find time for your work and studying. Remember it’s temporary, not all rotations are equally hard, and working a job won’t be like this. A lot of help from their SO or other family members are how my classmates with children were able to do it- they weren’t just magically able to handle things on their own and no one expects you to either.Damn. An asshole/possibly abusive husband is even more reason not to make any decisions that would limit her potential future independence, but I don’t have any advice that hasn’t already been said. I really hope she’s able to find some in-person support to get her through this.Grades don’t matter at all once you get your degree.

Q: What do you call the  person who graduates last in their vet school class?

A: DoctorHahahahaha!

This was clearly written by someone who thinks we just play with puppies and kittens all day.We recently fired a client because she’d consistently decline about half the recommendations made for her dog’s chronic condition and was generally noncompliant even with the things she did approve. 

Every time the dog would start to show improvement she’d cancel or no show the next follow up appointment only to resurface several months later complaining about how he never go better and “nothing ever works!” Then we’d have to start back at square one, which included explaining everything she’d already been told about her dog’s condition all over again like it was new information and then coming up with plan B, C, and D until she finally approved something. After a few cycles enough was enough. I feel so sad for the dog but I know I was never going to be able to help him anyway. I really tried.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

You can’t save them all in vet med, and it just sucks- the worst are the terrible clients who can pay but let their animals suffer because they don’t care. And there’s really not much we can do about that. I say all this not to say you shouldn’t do it, but I think your passion may be in a different aspect of veterinary/shelter medicine that is SO NEEDED. For example, in many states , low cost spay/neuter funding goes underutilized because the process it apply for grants is so top-heavy that vets (at least the ones I know have said this) give up out of frustration. There is real, valuable skills you could bring with your current passions- if they involve school, great! But they don’t HAVE to. Best of luck, definitely try to do some shadowing in a clinic to get a feel before taking the plunge.I am applying to veterinary school this year and some family members look at me oddly when I say that I feel really passionate about a couple things, including oncology and end-of-life care. Thank you for the work you do, and for showing me there’s space out there for people like me.","Veterinarian.

2. You cannot care this much.  You need to be less emotionally invested.  It clouds your judgment.  Pretty much every big mistake I’ve ever made was because I cared too much and couldn’t see straight.You don’t have to have a reason.  You can just say you don’t feel comfortable with itIn the US left-handed instruments are readily available.  This should be a non-issue, I feel bad for the vet who says their practice won't buy them instruments. We just bought a handful of left-handed needle drivers and scissors for our lefty vet.  They are autoclaved individually so they can be dumped on top of whatever pack she is using.

In general with surgery always set yourself up for success.  Demand (nicely) that the lights be in the right spot, the animal be right where you want it on the table, the scissors are sharp,  you have an appropriately sized drape etc etc.  It is just so much easier and your work will be better.Work-life balance in an internship??  I don’t think that is a thing.  At any internship.  No matter what they tell you.  What about just getting a job at a small ER?I wanted to interact with animals every day, make good money, and be able to live anywhere I want (especially in big cities).

Your license is your livelihood. Protect it all costs. Best of luck.You are an intern. You might be dealing with fatigue, maybe even burnout or depression. 

Please be kind to yourself OP. I’m a non-traditional vet student so I’m older than almost all of the residents and interns at my hospital which means I have a bit of a different perspective on specialized training (when I was a PhD student we compared ourselves by the number of hours we worked and took pride in how much time we spent in the lab and how little we slept. This is not healthy). 

My heart breaks for you guys; the specialty tracks in vet med need *major* reform. Please give yourself graceIt might not just be the techs, there could be some grumblings amongst the vets/other staff as well. Absolutely go to management, but I think this might be indicative of a larger issue, and if that’s the case, I’d leave if I were OPWow fuck ur brave man. What a helluva first gig hot damnDVM ought to open more doors. Yeah, maybe you don’t do clinical medicine. I guarantee you the stuff you’re interested in could benefit from a veterinarian’s insight; the training is really different than what you would get in an MPH and not in a bad way.

If you like what you’re learning and are enjoying the progress you are making, why not stick with it? It doesn’t seem like changing at this point has a significant upsideAww yay! Happy the cat is doing well

And handwritten note and some food. Any food. Your vet clinic is hungry and I guarantee they need a snack, chances are most of them didn’t eat breakfastJust dropping in to say fuck that sounds hardOnce I realized that the evaluations were inconsistent and worthless I stopped reading evals. I also stopped caring about grades. 

The last few weeks of clinics my apathy grew and I stopped caring about showering, eating, and brushing my teeth.

I was so happy when I was a technician. And I worked with Doctors who loved their lives. These doctors hated vet school.

It will get betterDisagree. I felt that I was an outsider on every rotation and had to deal with a non-negligible number of women who were openly hostile towards me. 

I had to kiss ass twice as hard as the “cool girls” who were able to befriend the residents in order to have my ideas heard or even just to talk to my house officer to discuss my case. I was often dismissed and passed over and the expectation was that I was supposed to go along with it. One person straight up lied in my review and claimed I had yelled at a technician. 

I think it just sucks regardless, idk how gendered it isWhat year were you? I have heard thingsNot denying any of that. Just refuting the point that “felt like there was an added quality of life boost if you’re a guy” because it was an outright falsehood in my experienceYou’ll be delighted to hear nothing has changed. I heard a rumor of a clinician who referred to dog muscle as “korean food” during dissection in front of two visiting Korean veterinarians.

This clinician apparently berated the resident the entire procedure, calling them dumb and stupid and useless.I had a 3.9 and a masters and got waitlisted 2 times before getting in on year three. By the time I accepted the offer I had 4 years of full-time vet tech experience and 6 peer-reviewed scientific articles.

As a student on my surgery rotation after four hours of an orthopedic procedure where my resident was berated and shit on nonstop by the attending faculty, when the faculty member stepped out for the resident to close she took a pause and looked me straight in the eye and said “don’t ever do a residency.”

Rich_Ad473,"To become a really good zoo vet, you must work in a zoo full-time.   
On the other hand, if you aspire to work with exotic pets, you should be employed by a veterinary hospital. Zoo vets do not treat pets owned by private individuals. They are responsible for caring for zoo animals, and exposing them to diseases that outside animals carry could put the entire zoo collection at risk.   
However, it is possible to provide veterinary care to a nearby zoo's collection while working in a pet exotic hospital if that zoo is too small to have a full-time vet. But if you only work one day a week in a zoo, you will never become a good zoo vet.   
However, you can switch from working full-time in a zoo to working full-time in a pet exotic hospital, or vice versa, after a few years.   
There is a large overlap between the type of animals you would see as an exotic and zoo vet. In both cases, you would work with birds, reptiles, and small mammals. The main difference between zoo vets and those who treat exotic pets is that the latter often perform surgeries and other hands-on procedures, while the former typically practice preventive medicine.70,000-90,000 GBP per year before taxes. Depends on the location and your production too.Age is not an issue. I passed my zoo med boards (ACZM) when I was 44, while working full time. However, you have to publish three first author papers to sit the exam. You have to start work on those now if you want to be eligible to take the exam 10 years later. Since the questions of the exam came from the publications from the last 5 years you have to start seriously studying 5 years before you are planning to take the exam the first time.

Outside_Cap1540,"Tough decision! Personally, I would say that if you have been on track to go into the veterinary field, I would continue with that. Your boyfriend and his family shouldn't interfere with your personal decisions, but I can understand why you'd consider them. While I agree that paying off debt from Med School may be easier, you have different options in both fields.


For example, you could continue your education after becoming a doctor and choose a specialty. There are board certified veterinary ophthalmologists, neurologists and etc. Those professions pay more than the average DVM profession. You also have the option of working with other Veterinarians or starting your own practice. There are also holistic veterinary hospitals that use Chinese medicine and acupuncture as part of their approach to animal care.


For Medical school, you have the option of getting an M.D. or D.O. Similarly to the holistic veterinary area, a D.O. learns a more holistic approach to medicine. Both are still regarded as medical doctors and treated the same way in practice, but a patient may prefer one over the other.


There are a lot less Schools of Veterinary Medicine compared to Medical Colleges. That may be something you have to take into consideration. You have to ask yourself how far you would be willing to relocate in order to attend the colleges you're accepted to.


Also, are you enjoying your internships and pre-Vet research? Or would you rather be doing something involving human medicine?


In my experience, learning complicated material is easier if your interests are focused in that area. Either way, both professions pay well. I think you should go with the decision that would make you the happiest. There will always be pros and cons in any career, but you don't want a job that you dread going to when you wake up.

Just want to say,  of all specialties,  surgery is a manual dexterity/innate skill specialty. Having worked with hundreds of vets,  some have innate skill and some will never be excellent surgeons.

Strixt,"Yes other clinics are experiencing a sudden slow down from mid February and onward. There is a discussion on VIN about it.

February is the slow month usually. Add to not everyone having taxes back yet and you have this slow down.

Due to inflation it appears it is slowing down more than the normal February slow down. Some areas are certainly not hit as bad as others.

We will have to wait and see where this goes.You should see the evaluation and then pay for your own evaluation. That 15 million seems high.

I could argue you can acquire a loan for 3-5 million and purchase land and build new building and have enough business within a reasonable time. All making it cheaper to start fresh…. But you need to evaluate for yourself. Don’t be afraid to go that route. Many vets have left, moved down the street on their own and been more successful than taking a raw deal.I understand the ethicality of waiting until treatment is over and a confirmed negative fecal. 

However the er near me has a sign when you walk in that threatens to fire anyone if you so much as use a curse word to the receptionist or even another client in the lobby… you’re gone. I have clients who have been fired from that er facility. They complain to me and all I think in my head is, “whelp you probably shouldn’t have done what ya did.”

Also you don’t need a drafted letter. Most veterinary software systems have a predefined letter you can use. You can also find letters made by others on Vetcove forums or VIN forums.Know a new grad going to Chicago. 130k base 22% production working 4-10 hour days. 3-4 weeks PTO.

Chicago, Austin Texas, Atlanta Georgia, etc are mini versions of New York imo. Where you can expect to make a decent chunk more than your average Midwest city. That is often due to high cost of living. Your Chicago and Madison Wi vet clinics will charge 350-600 for idexx senior panels bloodwork. While your average midwestern vet clinic will charge 220-320 for the same. So your percentage will be higher and you will make base plus percent easily due to clinic fees usually being higher.

In my opinion working 40 hours or more sucks. And while higher base sounds good and sure the almost guaranteed added percentage due to high clinic prices is great. It all ends up being pointless when you pay so much for rent, food, etc makes it negligible.

I’d rather live in a decent Midwest city making base 110-150 (depending on experience.) afford a home that is the same price or cheaper than Chicago rent and have equity in something substantial. Then I can sell the home after so many years and break even or gain a profit. Other factors keep me away from Chicago such as less crime, cheaper food prices, cheaper taxes, gas, the list goes. Again this is my opinion. 

Renting is not an investment. A house is.

The low cost average home in a “nice area” in Chicago where a lot of cops and teachers live will run you minimum 370k+. Average home in other parts of Midwest are more often range in the 220kish for something of similar quality with often guaranteed real estate taxes.


Sorry for my rant….I think it boils down to the individual. If you enjoy that environment you are going to thrive. You will net enough money to live in a big city. Will it equal out to being where you are or maybe net you more? Could go either way. Guaranteed you’ll make enough to afford life easily.

You simply need to count the costs of the environment in which you’ll be. Best to ask where you’ll be happy to live and worry about the rest later.TLDR: it is probably true. To brag about getting an offer from every NVA and VCA like corporation is very silly and all vets can do that…

Covid changed our entire world.

1. Covid caused many Americans to become first time pet owners at a rapid rate we have never seen.

2. Many vets who were close to retiring did so earlier than expected. 

3. Vets with children, especially female vets, exited the industry entirely or dropped down to part time, relief work, or at home euthanasia. Allowing to take control over their lives and bringing their mental health up.

4. Colleges haven’t been producing enough vets. Specifically male rural vets. And no I am not saying that myself. This is from a Dvm 360 article written in the 2010s by a female Dvm author.

There are certainly other factors. You get the gist.

Banfield/vca, nva, and similar corporations will give you an offer regardless of anything. If you ask for an interview they will give you an offer guaranteed. Often times these offers burn you out by the 1st or 2nd year… but you will receive offers easily. I suggest advocating for higher base salary, lower hours, and other benefits. It is a employees market and don’t allow any vet clinic to tell you otherwise!

One huge issue is recruiting firms. Many naive students all over stem will be contacted by recruiters who will promise the world and deliver nothing. Recruiters are encouraged to obtain your information and get you into their database. They want to harvest your information as much as possible. Regardless of whether they can get you a job or not. It is also better not to work with one if you can. Why would a clinic want to pay a recruiter 30% of your annual salary when you can demand that 30% or close to it yourself as a sign on bonus and double dip.I recommend therapy. You need to address your own grief before being able to handle others. This outlook is very concerning when you haven’t started your career yet. I believe in you and I hope you can believe in yourself. You are graduating and  that is an accomplishment in itself. Take pride in it!

You only fail if you haven’t tried. You will gain experience with the right clinical environment. Despite what others may say on Reddit if you look hard enough you can have clinics who will hire you for the hours of your choosing. We hear the constant complaints on this thread about negative experiences because happy people don’t need to vent.

Find a clinic who will give you longer appointments times as needed for up to 6 months. Give you longer surgery times. Allow you to shadow all surgeries before performing them yourself. And even when performing them the clinic will have a colleague to be in the room or nearby once you start tackling these procedures.

Lots of clinics won’t even let you see their crazy clients until you’re ready. And usually the crazy clients won’t trust or even want to see a new grad so it works in your favor.

At home euthanasia takes a toll. Being in a clinic and seeing brand new puppies and kittens for their first shots will bring more joy. Joy I feel you may need.If you are not getting better with therapy you may need to assess your therapist. Not all therapists are the right fit. You definitely need to think about finding a better fit if you think you aren’t trending towards a positive mindset. 

You end up spending more time with the people you work with than some of your immediate family and friends. So you are very smart to think ahead and look for positive environments where you can thrive and handle challenges that this field will come at you with. Having a good team is important. And not a good family… I don’t need work to be a family I need it to be a good team. There is a big difference imo.

All new grads are behind in knowledge, especially the basics. Most of the vet schools do not give you enough training in spay/neuters, ultrasound, dental, etc. at least you recognize your faults this gives you an upper hand. If you know where you lack you’ll actually be able to improve faster than your peers who are truly at the same level. You should always find a clinic who will give you over 3k in CE allowance and up to 5 days of PTO for ce. This way you can actually take advantage of filling the gaps in your skill set before you settle down and put roots and travel becomes more difficult with increased familial obligations.1. It’s okay to be nervous or overwhelmed. If you are being interviewed by fellow doctors they won’t care because they were in your shoes not so long ago. If they care that you are nervous that is a red flag that you should stay away.

2. You are unprepared. That is okay. You need to take the time to think about what you want rather than what your peers want. Peer pressure is strong. I highly suggest a quiet place for 30 minutes a day to journal what your goals are now, and every year after. Ideally you should start to establish a plan for every year that would make you happy. Your happiness is priority, the highest salary, best location, best benefits, etc are all secondary’s. The reason I say this is because I constantly see stories on this sub about burnout after 6 months to 2 years. Young vets chasing the top salaries and then being worked like Amish horses. Now wanting to leave the industry entirely.

3. Journal, journal, journal. How many hours do you want to work a week? What cities are you okay with working in? What CE do you want to go after? (I highly recommend finding a clinic who will pay for you to go to sound in Texas in year one for ultrasound. Then year two go to dental in Atlanta Georgia. Then year three write what you want in your journal of what ce next. The CE courses that cost the most often have information that vet school should have taught you. But that is another gripe for another day.)

4. Interview everywhere. Don’t trust what people say. Get it in writing. Interview at the hospital who has the same doctor owner for 20+ years. Will he teach you or will he vacation as soon as you join? Interview at the corporation. Are you meeting the hiring manager in person? Are they promising you the world but won’t give you anything in writing? Will they say you will work at only one clinic but then swap you around to three different clinics as they need?

5.my opinion - recommendation if I was you. Go to a practice where you can learn. That means finding a place with 3-5 vets. Check their schedule on their system. Make sure they book out less than a few days at time. That way you know they are busy but not too busy. Make sure the one or more vets are 2-6 years out. That way they are still practicing similar to how you were taught but have enough fun experience to help you advance quickly and make less mistakes. They can guide you through the mistakes they’ve made so you can make less. Find the appropriate salary to hourly wage. A place that won’t pressure you. A place where you are allowed to adjust your surgery time so you can take the time needed. A place where you can fire clients who cross the line and the owner will stand behind your decision to fire someone. (Had a drunk lady show up for her appointment recently and admit to driving here and drinking alcohol. We sent that fire letter the very next day, goodbye.)You get to pretend to own something. Forced to work day and night as if it’s your baby. Never to see real profits and never to be able to make any real decisions. Nor have the opportunity to sell what you built as a nice umbrella when you are older.

They can sell it out right from under you. Kick you out and buy you out at any time. Stipulate you make x or you forfeit your shares. So much bad…

Better off moving to a small town where people vacation to and be a one doctor practice and only be open four days a week. 

Better off forcing this company to pay you to be a medical director. Force them to send you to ce to be a director. Pay you to be one. That can be your “share” for running their clinic. Save up enough and strike out on your own then after you have the experience.


If it’s about money there are other ways. Relief work on your off days. At home euthanasia on your off days. That way you make ridiculous money when you want to… but then cruise the world because you aren’t tied down to owning anything.

You don’t need to fire, hire, and perform payroll and a whole list of everything else. You aren’t the one who is called when the security alarm goes off. You don’t have to worry about the fridge breaking and calling the insurance company to try and replace thousands in vaccine, librela, solensia, cytopoint,  carprofen,  etc. You don’t care that your vet associate is sleeping with a cvt and that associates significant other flys in from out of town and that significant other finds them in bed and gets the cvts gun out of his bag.If I can add. 

Pro’sal is usually with a cemented 40 hour work week.

Often times taking vacation days during that month will result in a net loss that carries over to the next month to be made up. Essentially punishing you and making your vacation not really paid as you now need to produce more after your vacation to play make up. Normally there is a renewal at the end of the year with no roll over.It would be good for you to research on Vetcove or VIN.

If you only care about profits “antech” has the best margins. Be ready for headaches here and there as there service/quality in our experience is as good as idexx. They seem to be cheaper but they are also owned by mars who also owns sound, rcvd, banfield, vca, vetco, etc.


Zoetis hasn’t been around long enough for me to hear anything good or bad. Issue is normally supply chain/pick up issues and volume with newer companies. Abaxis was a new company and went downhill pretty fast and glad I stuck with idexx.


Idexx costs the most but gives you the least amount of headaches. I can always reach a costumer service rep. They charge if you use too many hours of service though. You’ll need to ask how much it is. Getting ahold of specialists as needed for consults is nice. I wouldn’t use idexx for X-rays consults though. Better off with AxisVet imo.

Idexx videos are pretty good for learning how to use and maintain the machines.

If you want a good comparison you should demand both companies send you the how to and maintenance videos. It’ll be easier to tell which one your support staff with have an easier time dealing with.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Comprehensive_Toe113,"Bro OK I'm not a vet but I am very autistic and I can tell you that your mental health has adverse affects on your body.

The brain is the most advanced computer we have.

It can convince us that we are sick to the point we get phantom symptoms.

You absolutely need to do some things to recharge your batteries. Something you enjoy, something you can do and just go on autopilot. It doesn't even have to be something you enjoy. It could be just doing a bit of housework. Walking the dog, and adult colouring book (no I'm not joking)

If at work there's anything lower stress that you can do then do that. Could be just paperwork or background shit where you don't have to deal with clients.Not a vet and even I know declawing is fucking terrible when it's done for pure convenience

Declawing because the nail is growing into the foot and would cause further (worse) issues? Absolutely.I'm not a vet or even studying but it's all too easy to compare yourself to other people.

Your grades will be the biggest indicator.

Also as others have said it never hurts to watch YouTube videos in the same vein as what you're studying (animal medicine) but also something that might interest you (equine health, reptile health etc) read reputable papers from credited sources, there's always room to grow. Even the best vets are learning new things every day.

Now if only I could even look at uni courses without having a panic attack that would be great.The suicide rate in emts and vets are very high for a reason.

Can you deal with people bringing in a healthy animal not wanting to give it the help it's needs bevause it's too much expensive and then just euthanising it?


Can you handle seeing severely neglected animals or abused animals?


Can you handle doing everything you can for a patient who you have been seeing since It was a few months old and having it die on you then having to tell the owner?

Depending on where you live can you handle declawing a cat even though you know it's wrong?

There's alot of fucked up shit that vets see and just like emts they should be given government subsidised therapy. It's a rough fucking job and it's not all happy pretty rainbows.

Zora74,"A nice fruit basket would be lovely and very appreciated, and generally it can be eaten by everyone even if someone on staff is diabetic or has a chocolate allergy. 

You Could also ask if your hospital has a rescue fund for people who can’t afford treatment and make a donation to that, or donate to a local rescue they work with in your kitty’s name.BluePearl has the EmERge program that, as far as I know, doesn’t have a set start date. However, from what I’ve seen working in a BP in the NYC market, they don’t provide the mentorship they promise. If you do that route, I would ask to speak to people who’ve done the entire program at the hospital you are thinking of enrolling.

Sorry, I just looked into it, and they have a July/January start time as well, with the first four weeks having to be done in TampaTurn off the iso and the oxygen for flipping otherwise you’re just blowing the iso in the tubes into the room and when your patient is hooked back up they have a lower concentration of iso in the breathing system.I don’t think any practice would make an estimate for a sick animal that they haven’t seen, because they can’t know what, exactly, is going on or if the treatment plan your vet proposed is the one they would follow. They also would t know what diagnostics have already been run, and diagnostics are a huge portion of any sick pet invoice. 

Giving a ballpark for a routine spay/neuter isn’t that uncommon because those are typically healthy pets and very straightforward procedures.It isn’t uncommon for practices to not want to give out ballpark figures for their procedures, but I feel like that is changing with time. Many will have a list of typical spay/neuter prices at reception so the receptionists don’t even have to ask anyone. 

I don’t see why invoices should be consistently over estimates by such a large margin in a GP practice. The only thing I can think of where invoices could run high with some regularity would be dental procedures, but even those should have a wide range on the estimate because we know that we don’t have a complete idea of what needs to be done until the animal is anesthetized and the rads are done, and the invoice should still fall within the higher end of the range. 

When these bills come in over the estimate, does the practice owner discuss this with the client before they come in to pay, or, even better, before the extra charges are incurred? They should definitely not be leaving this conversation for receptionists or technicians to have with clients. 

If your hours are being cut because the practice is slow, I would look for another job. There is typically a predictable mild slow down in January and February, but most practices are able to combat this with Dental month promotions, and I’ve never worked anywhere that cuts employee hours for those months. Since Covid, I don’t even know if that seasonal slowdown is really applicable anymore. Most of the vets in my area are still having full schedules. I would take the combination of shady invoicing and cutting hours as red flags.If you’re mostly doing relief work, do you actually need a DEA number?I hope the company/companies that you are working for are covering the costs!You can summarize a lot of of messages by just listing the questions they have, with a little bit of background or a sentence about why they are asking a specific question. The only time I leave a longer message or comm log is when clients are angry, unreasonable, or a mistake has been made that needs correcting, where I really need to document what, exactly, was said. Otherwise, my message would probably have been “o has questions about seizures and plan going forward/meds/what to look for.”  Then maybe a line about why they are calling, like “has family member with seizure disorder and wants to discuss further diagnostics” to let the person calling them back know that there is a specific reason or concern prompting the message, and prepare them to explain the differences between human medicine and veterinary medicine.It’s squandered time and money, but if the only thing holding you back from a tech degree is an externship or a single class, you might as well do it, though your raise will likely not cover the cost of the extra class you took.I would call Avimark.For an assistant position I would just apply and get trained on the job. Important things to remember are to always provide water to a patient unless specifically told not to, always double leash dogs on a slip lead when walking them (most dogs can slip out of a collar and even a harness if they are trying to back away), always write down all urinations/defecations a pet has done in hospital, and never ever ever do anything that you aren’t comfortable with or haven’t been trained to do. An assistant should be doing things like restraining (when appropriately trained), cleaning the hospital, cleaning cages, and walking dogs. You can also directly help a technician or a doctor do things like get blood, place IV catheters, or take x rays, but these are not your responsibility on your own. 

Also, when making up meds, double check labels on the bottle and the label in your hand twice. 

Do not do anything with insulin, leave that to doctors and techs. 

Best of luck to you.Once you get your certification, start interviewing. Job changes come with raises. Make sure you are getting a pay differential for weekend hours.  

You can work towards a VTS, but it’s a lot of work and the salary increase will depend heavily on where you are working and what you are doing. I’d probably just start thinking about a new career now while you’re young.Veterinary Technician Specialist. It’s a way to specialize in various specialty fields. In the US they are pretty respected and it does come with a raise,  but you have to be certified for at least three years before you can apply and there is a lot of work and study involved to the point where is probably more worthwhile to go to school for a different career that pays a better base salary. 

You could probably start a job search now as companies always seem more willing to invest in acquiring new employees over retaining current ones. Get in writing what your pay will increase to once your registration comes through. WA simple card will do, and the thought will be appreciated. 

If you want to do more, a nice fruit basket is extremely considerate.I would just look for a new job. You aren’t going to fix it.  When you leave, an email to regional management delineating what’s been going on and why you’re leaving might be effective. 

If everything else is fine and it really is just these two people, I would contact HR and regional management, *especially* if you are witnessing bullying and not the one actually being bullied. I got much not interest and a lot less gas lighting when I reached out with concerns over how another person was treated than I did with concerns about how I was being treated or how my department was being run.

Also, why are students taking out the garbage? You are there to learn, not do chores. I have never asked a student to take out the garbage. The most I’ve asked is to clean a cage or clean iso, which is directly related to their education and experience.  I would bring this up with HR and with the school if the students are being treated like cheap labor.My sister works at Costco and makes more an hour that I do (certified technician at a er/specialty hospital with 30 years working in vet med), she has excellent benefits, and gets annual bonuses. 

FML, I’ve screwed up so bad I don’t know how to fix it. Get out while you can.Just wear your scrubs, if your employer wants a certain kind of scrubs or wants certain information on them, let them pay for it. You should be getting a uniform allowance to put towards scrubs and any requested embroidery. 

*Do Not* put your full name on your scrubs. People are psychotic and assistants/ techs tend to be young women. Your first name is all that is needed.Just weigh everyone in kgs, that way there is no confusion. It also takes a step out most of drug calculations, which is an added safety bonus.How about a donation in their name to a charitable cause?I used to do the ordering and inventory of controlled substances at my last job. Getting class II drugs is a pain, but certainly not such a pain that it makes it prohibitive. It’s certainly within the capabilities of Banfield Corporation.I understand that. I used to do the ordering and fill out the forms, and have them rejected for very stupid reasons. It just meant that I ordered in advance and had two people proofread my forms before they were sent, with the practice owner being the final proofread. 

We still carried schedule IIs and had a reliable supply, barring manufacturer backorder.

Don’t let it distract you from going into er. I just say do an internship first.

Don’t feel bad about the money side of it because typically when animals come in that critical they’re going to be spending a lot more money (hospitalization, etc. it’s not usually a quick fix or OP procedure). 

The only thing I would change would be instead of saying “fluffy can’t breathe” I would change it to “fluffy is in a very critical state right now and the doctor needs approval to perform life saving measures such as ivc placement, fluid blood, possibly intubation, etc.”A date that will forever be seared into my brain lolAgree with skipping the VA program, just start with tech school.

PurrBucket,"On the flip side, I had a human nurse client once  and I was triaging her dog at my previous ER during COVID (curbside) and she said she had spent the whole day giving COVID vaccines and I thanked her for doing that. She said “no, thank you. You all are amazing for doing what you do.” And even when I was asking history and explaining things, I said “I’m sure you understand why we need to do X” and she said “yes, but you’re the experts so tell me anyway”. And it was incredibly refreshing and I’ll never forget her lolHello! I hope I can bring some good perspective here. I’m an RVT, going on 20 years in the industry overall. I also have been practicing, performing and teach improv (for performance) almost just as long. Recently I’ve developed an interest in applied improvisation as it relates to communication in a veterinary hospital setting. 

1) in my experience, vet professionals are introverts, for the most part. You always hear folks say they want to work with animals, not people, in the field. I just started at a new hospital and I just ate lunch in a completely silent, yet full, break room. Personally, my experience is with introverts. 

2) vet professionals aren’t performers. The work you’re describing in the class is extremely performative, and having a side-coach like that can be very intimidating. I would cry in that class too, and I have decades of experience with both of these things. Personally, I would not feel safe to be vulnerable in that class. And that’s how you have to be receptive to feedback like that, is being bold and vulnerable to make a choice about your communication, and then you have to be resilient to not take the coaching personally. Not a really useful way to go about it, IMO. Just based on your post, it sounds like a place to cultivate fear and not great communication skills. 

3) do your best not to take it personally. I hope you can find something to take away from the class. But honestly if people are interested in improving communication skills, I would highly recommend improv. Applied Improvisation takes exercises that help performers learn listening, empathy, body language, and resiliency, among other things. It adjusts the purpose of the exercise from
The stage to interpersonal communication. I highly highly recommend it.My favorite is when owners tell me they know the doctor gave them the wrong product because they “know what it smells like and they didn’t need to do the diagnostics, I could have just told them.

timetravelingwalrus,"Surprised at the number of people that disagree with this. Veterinary school is the ULTIMATE dichotomy- I would stretch to say every good and bad thing that has been said in this Reddit community is absolutely true to some capacity and the experience is obviously highly unique for every individual. EXTREME highs and EXTREME lows the entire time…

Differing perspectives in vet med are valuable- even ones like this… this is the reality of the turbulent times in Veterinary School and a valid experience that many face when they are pursuing medicine that isn’t small/large animal. 

While I think this individual should continue school and they will find pretty amazing job opportunities (aquaculture is in demand and crazy important), these perspectives are valid and there is truth here. 

Ultimately no one can for sure say that veterinary medicine is entirely x or y (obviously) and if this deters people from pursuing medicine then maybe that’s okay (?), it’s up to the individual to collect all info and decide what they believe is best for them.

Veterinary school is wonderful and awful in every way.This gives me hope as a soon to be new grad considering going into shelter for my love of community but also the work/life appeal.

johnolerudshelmet,"I'm going to repeat what most other posters have said, but from reading your post, it's the truth.  

This isn't a case of you not being cut out to be a vet. You have fallen into a very bad first job with a very bad first boss, which unfortunately happens a lot in vet med. I promise you, there are good owners and good clinics out there that you should definitely explore before giving up on general practice altogether.  

As far as this nasty boss being intent on burning you out during your 2 month notice, I would recommend 2 things. First, if you have an employment contract, re-read it very carefully. There is likely some language in there regarding a ""reasonable workload"" or something very similar. With all of the stress, anxiety and mental health problems you have accumulated since starting this position, I feel you would have a strong legal case to say your workload is unreasonable for someone of your experience level.  

Secondly, I would definitely chat with an employment lawyer. I noticed you're in Canada in another comment, I know the OVMA provides free initial legal consults, I'm sure other provinces associations have something similar, if not, pay a few hundred dollars to talk to an employment lawyer. This should give you a more finite idea of the actual repercussions of leaving before your notice period is up.  

I'm sorry this has happened to you, but just know this is not a reflection of you, but a reflection on a greedy unempathetic owner.","Other. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Other"" as it does not directly mention the profession of the author, but rather provides advice and support",Other
sn0wmermaid,"If OP is American they can absolutely ask for a reasonable accommodation to sit. During school, residency and work.  If you're at a school that has a vet school you could ask to be a simulated client if they have a communication class for their vet students! Cool way to network with profs in the actual vet school as well. I didn't learn about this opportunity until I was actually in vet school.  It's obv not vet experience necessarily but something to add to your app. The nursing sub is also quite cathartic. I like working but all the lamenting of these ""women's"" professions make me think being a housewife doesn't sound so bad. My day to day looks a lot different from many classmates, but in a week we generally have about 8 hours of labs and about 15-18 hours of (recorded) lectures. I work 8-20 hours per week + spend plenty of time on hobbies. Average is probably about 10-12. My job is very flexible. I'm not in any clubs or electives. Some people have to study more and some people have to study less, but the people who worked during undergrad seem to be the ones who are still capable of working in vet school. Ugh. I'm a vet student and I live in the INW also. I really want to work with cattle and I could tolerate equine but not at that rate. :/ Ah that's so much call. But honestly I feel like you can and should ask for more because you deserve way better than that!! If I still worked at my last CNA job in Spokane and were taking that much call (which is a quite different type of call obv but paid at 15%/hr of whatever my hourly works out to for the month) I'd make ~75k! I know wages aren't crazy high here and it's not apples to apples but DVM vs CNA, your job is WORLDS more skilled. I'm sure you learned a lot but internships are so scammy and predatory Not saying nosite is wrong but in most, maybe all states public employee salaries and pay scales are public and google-able. I've worked for a plethora of government agencies, a university, and in federal, county and state government in three different states. My current state pays most employees better than the private sector across most fields, with a few specific exceptions and my benefits plus pension are worth 3-4,000 a month. I have worked for governments that pay less than the private sector as well. Anyway, if you're open to moving, I'd check around to schools in several different states!Oh my, this is heartbreaking. Do you have any siblings, cousins, close friends? Anyone who could maybe help you with the kids for a bit? Let you stay with them?

Mountain-Crab-7668,"Practice Manager here to say, you can probably get a job literally anywhere. Ask for an observation interview and really pay attention to the staff, how do they interact with each other, how do the techs treat the kennel or reception staff and visa versa. Do they ask each other for help, do they offer help when no one asks. Are the Veterinarians belittling the staff, if so they probably will not mentor you either. Everyone in the clinic matters and should be treated that way. 

You can probably even get a contract that doesn't require a 30+ day notice if you explain that you are looking for a place that is working towards removing toxicity in the field and follows through with mentorship; you've been burned in the past and do not want either party to feel stuck staying where you don't belong or needing to leave short notice because of toxicity.You are amazing.

cl4rkcl4rkcl4rk,">ng shadowing experience is so critical, not just for gaining the experience for applications, but also to make sure you want to enter this field. I wouldn't want to do anything else except vet med, but there are plenty of cons so just be sure that you are 100% invested in the long-haul of vet school and a career in the field.

Thanks for sharing and congrats on getting to where you are now, that is very inspiring! I can see how your background would provide you with applicable skills for veterinary practice. Also thank you for pointing out that you started out shadowing before getting a position as a veterinary assistant. I was thinking I'd try to get shadowing experience after I had some experience as a VA, but maybe I'd have better luck the other way around. Can I ask, did you continue working your substance abuse/psychology job while shadowing? If so, how did you balance your schedule?[Cross posting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Veterinary/comments/1aboevd/looking_for_guidance_from_veterinariansvascvts/) \- I didn't see this until after I submitted my own post:

&#x200B;

Hello,  
I know that this community has a lot of fearless career changers and am looking for guidance on making the leap into veterinary medicine. I am in the early stages of pursuing vet med, and am having a difficult time getting hired as a veterinary assistant without experience or certifications.  
**I’m looking for:**  
\- Any critiques on my action plan (see below) for completing prerequisites and gaining experience before applying to DVM programs  
\- Suggestions for how to break into the veterinary field and gain experience for the DVM application  
\- Stories from people who have successfully changed careers and earned entry into a DVM program  
\- Stories from others who are currently pursuing a career change into veterinary medicine  
\- Advice from anyone who works in hiring for veterinary assistant positions  
**Additional context:** Over the last few years I have had a nagging need to find a more suitable career for myself. I have a successful career in Health IT, but as the years go by, I have realized that I am not passionate about my work, and need something where I have a more tangible impact on my community. I have bounced around the idea of becoming a veterinarian for years, but I always wrote it off as unrealistic because I have no background in sciences (I majored in economics), have never worked in a veterinary clinic, and would be giving up the financial security of my current career. After much thought and deliberation, as well as some research, and anecdotal evidence of people making career changes into this field, I now feel that becoming a vet is not something I want to do, but something I need to do.

**Action Plan:** I have mapped out the prerequisite courses that I need to take and determined that I could complete the remaining courses in as little as one year, though I know I may need more time. I want to use this time to also gain veterinary clinical experience as a veterinary assistant. If I follow this plan, and work hard, I believe that I could be accepted into veterinary school within the next 2-3 years. I feel highly determined, courageous and energized about making this career change a reality and have a supportive partner who wants to see me achieve my dream.  
**Current Roadblock:** I have applied to several Veterinary Assistant positions in my city, but I have been met with many swift rejections (without a callback or an interview). I understand that I do not have clinical experience, but I do list several animal experiences on my resume, including: managing a veterinary health data transformation project, creating a partnership with the local humane society for a philanthropy event in college, and owning a dog as animal experiences. The rest of the resume summarizes my professional experience in Health IT, where I have successfully led complex project teams for 3+ years.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: Veterinarian.

entvet,"We instituted a 5 dollar charge because people were simply not bothering to keep the original certificate when they knew they could just get a new one anytime for free.  We were having to reissue multiple certificates per day.  Once we instituted the fee, that dropped to a few per month.   We do not charge if they give us a good story about why they don’t have the original or if they insist they never got one in the first place.

KittyKatOnRoof,"Yeah, my biggest critique of a lot of these hospitals is a lack of teaching hospitals. My school has interns, residents, 4th years, 3rd years, and students from the Caribbean schools without a teaching hospital. We barely have the case load and staff to adequately teach these students. Adding more students in classes does nothing to remedy the need for more places to practice and hone clinical skills such as S/N, diagnosis, client communication, etc, etc, etc. Many of these schools have no plans to build a clinical hospital alongside. So their students will be sent in to hospitals that may not be able to adequately teach them. I would go for cheapest. I went to a tiny state school for undergraduate, was one of the top picks for my first choice school and my friend got into Cornell. You can save money, and use your time wisely to get involved in extracurriculars, research, and veterinary experience that will help you stand out a lot more than a prestigious school. Leptospirosis (urine) and rabies (saliva) are the big ones. Bites can cause bacterial infections. I mean, if you have a passion for shelters, there is a ton of work you can do to take the management, advocacy, and organization off the vets to make a big impact. Oftentimes, it's not just lack of vets or techs willing to do this work, it's lack of supplies, money, and organization power. I've worked with vets who can spay a dog every ten minutes. If they had access to an environment to help them, they could make a huge impact. But they're hindered by the legalities of operating, using controlled drugs, etc. Yes! I loved sending new owners home with a magnet of our local ER. My parents still have one, and it was very useful when my dog's eye started bleeding and they panicked. If you've finished the prerequisite classes, yes. You'll have to look at the schools you're interested in to see their requirements. The Vet at Noah's Ark was so good to me!I would say, because I'm sure grades and everything will be available on transcripts. On the write in section, just explain your dismissal and the academic steps you've taken since, as well as experience gained. My advisor recommended I break them down into research and veterinary experience to help create a diverse portfolio. Oof, that's rough. If she's consistently not getting asked to interview, she's not likely getting culled in a strict GPA cut-off or there is something in her written work of her application that is getting her ruled out. Without feedback, it's hard to say why.It has to do with what the national board requires. I'd recommend looking at the specific residency you're interested in requires to get a clear answer. Internships are typically required and may help with being competitive, but are not required for every specialty.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

No-Resident9480,"Most vet owners pay themselves a salary and then distribute the profit.  In this case I assume all profit is reinvested in the clinic for their various programsVaccinations - learn about what the vaccinations cover, frequency,  what preventatives are recommended in your area (and all the different brands as clients always ask) and weight/nutrition recommendations. 

Wellness - study what tests your vet might recommend and why. 

Urgent care - setting up fluid pumps and fluid rates for different situations.And once you get going then try to be proactive about things - keep things clean, organised and well stocked. Everything runs more smoothly when the clinic well kept.Honestly, I think you should start looking for a new job.  These techs are just nasty - you find them all over the place. You are never going to feel comfortable working with them and I suspect they are not going to support you.  I was so lucky that my head nurse at my first practice was super supportive, full of great tips and ideas (she had seen EVERYTHING in her 25+ years) and kept me calm when I felt like I was out of my depth.

Responsible_Ferret61,"I’m a tech and have been for 19 years. (I did take 9 years off to be a SAHM) I work part time and I absolutely love it still. 
Finding the right practice is the key though. Unfortunately, there are a lot of toxic workplaces so sometimes you’ve got to try a few out before you find the right fit. 
Pay is a big factor in the vet industry but it is improving and hopefully you will be well compensated when you’re finished.Not trying to dissuade you but a few things to consider. 
You would very likely be taking a significant pay cut if you move from finance to vet med. 
Vet med is not a typical 9-5 and usually involves a few later nights a week and weekends 
As much as the job is animal based it’s also very much a people job and you have to like working in a team and dealing with clients from all walks of life and financial backgrounds. 
Sometimes the work sucks and burnout is a very real concern and the risk of mental health issues associated with the field is an important thing to consider. 

The good things are the work can be incredibly fulfilling, fun and there are an abundance of opportunities available in the field. 

Good luck!I’m a tech in Ontario, Canada and average wage is like $24 an hour. Minimum wage is $15. 
Honestly the only reason I’m still a tech is because my husband makes enough money for me to do this. I love my work but if it weren’t for my husband I would be living in poverty. 
I love the work we do and feel that it is extremely important but I can’t encourage anyone to join the field because it’s not sustainable for the long term.RVT here, please leave your job. It’s not worth it. It’s a toxic place that has likely pandered to the bullies and it’s not likely to change any time soon. There are so many opportunities available currently, please take advantage of them. 
I worked in a toxic clinic and it got so bad I would cry in my car before my shifts. Once I left and got a job with good people it was like night and day. You deserve to work with respectful coworkers.Thank you for respecting licensed technicians. I hate seeing people pretending to be licensed when they aren’t. If you know what state or province they are in you could contact the governing body for registered technicians. The governing body might be able to do something.At my clinic food is always appreciated. A fruit tray or doughnuts are great.

marwil20,"I'm curious how you've got the numbers for the vet school in the UK? Taking Edinburgh as an example, as that's where I study, tuition for starting next year is 37,500 fixed for the entire 5 years (this varies between schools). 

For living expenses, I would say that I spend less than £10,000 per year, including paying for flights to and from home in the US. That being said, I only go home once per year, round trip flight costing about $800.

Between those two figures the total cost (in GBP) is £237500, which at today's exchange rate is about $299,106.83. Taking into account the comment regarding lost earnings, this would push you even further towards coming to the UK. Obviously, the costs will vary between schools, Edinburgh is (I believe) cheaper for tuition, but a medium-high COL, Glasgow and London being far more expensive.

I know that you wanted to consider the financial aspects of this choice, but I would also urge you to consider the other aspects of the individual institutions you're applying to. The UK vet degree is an undergrad degree - you get to do societies and sports much more than a US vet degree. I might be biased, but I also think that the education process in the UK is much more collaborative between staff and students than in the US.

vetsquared,"A lot of what clinicians do is generally cultural. So we like to think that science guides everything that we do but that’s just not the case. If it was, we’d all  be doing ovariectomies (I am at least). There’s absolutely no reason to do a hysterectomy in a spay yet everybody in America does.  We have solid data to show from decades of ovariectomies in Europe yet for some reason that’s not convincing enough for everyone to change their behavior.

To answer your question then…no idea why we cherry pick.  Confirmation bias, fallacious thinking, habit, peer pressure, probably all play a role.I perform scrotal ablations on almost every older dog neuter to prevent this.  Scrotal hematomas are nasty and are not good for client relationships.

Learn to do scrotal ablations if your practice is regularly doing older dog neuters.  It pays dividends.No a scrotal ablation is when you make a circumferential incision around the scrotum and remove it with the testes.

Famous-Concentrate-7,"Curious what year you graduated? Penn was just in the local paper for overworking students (100+h weeks) mainly doing nursing duties like taking pets out and administering meds.Another frustrating effect of this is the trickle down. Residents and interns are miserable, which in turn makes them lash out at 4th years who are also miserable. It just creates an environment of toxicity/ misery and the schools just don’t fucking care.Currently going through the same thing. The didactic part of Vet school makes me miserable. I’m probably near top of my class on practical/clinical skills/knowledge but applying it on exams is another story. I actually feel like I’m losing clinical knowledge during didactic learning, it’s so much specific information that upperclassmen/graduates say they have never used. I’m just trying to get through until clinics start but I’m barely hanging on 😭Just because someone isn’t good with didactic learning doesn’t mean they don’t have a broad knowledge base. Vet school exams are challenging and some people are just poor test takers. Usually if they don’t do well it just means that they will broaden their knowledge in clinics more vs didactic.100%, I’m sure it comes in handy sometimes. But I’d rather be focusing on things that we will be seeing on a regular basis as practicing vets instead of diseases where it’s like “one reported case in the literature”.I agree with this BUT I also think it’s something that isn’t stored in long term memory unless you are using the material on a regular basis. I sucked at parasit bc there wasn’t any clinical context, just rote memorization. Once I worked in clinics and was actually dosing dewormers I became much more knowledgeable on life cycles, dosing, etc. Some people just learn differently 🤷🏻‍♀️","Veterinarian.

srosem343,"for anyone that did not pass, you will still be a wonderful doctor. Take a break from this emotional week, and start fresh next week. I know many great vets who are so intelligent and kind -- and they failed once or twice. It does not mean shit, and you CAN do it again. Everyone is rooting for it!! Friendly reminder to be kind to everyone this next week, I imagine it would feel pretty crummy to watch everyone celebrate, but don't let it break you. It will be okay!! No one can be YOU, and thats why we need you in the profession. Give yourself some grace, no one here is a failure <3It’s funny because I know that I would never judge anyone for failing— this test is absolutely not indicative of your abilities and intelligence as a doctor— yet I know that I will feel shame and disappointment, and I’m dreading the part when people ask if I passed. I can’t fake it. But the test was long. I felt ready as ever walking in, and was so numb when I walked out. Took me like a full week to process it and then I went, “oh my GOD I think I failed!”

I’m crossing my fingers and toes for everyone this week. We can do this! And we can do it again if we must 🤍Nothin like a little extra stress from the ICVA faking us out on a super fun day (I have stress colitis)Me too I was in rounds on my clinical rotation and was waiting for it to be over— went to check and I get the no documents available message! I should’ve just been a big girl and clicked the pdf when i had the chance. This is torture!! 😭some of my class can see theirs, but i can't see mine and neither can a few others. I'm not sure if its related to whether the result is pass or fail....hope notJust got mine tooimo that would be cruel and unusual punishmenti think they can still see itno idea, they haven't saidwhere? i dont see itI’m also waiting 😫 some days i feel like “I kicked ass I DESERVE to pass” and then other days I’m like “you left seven questions open on section two bc you didn’t time manage so that’s probably the 7 questions you needed to pass”. It’s so hard. Plus it’s clinical year now and the minute we get that email everyone will be talking about it… I’m not sure my poker face is too good. Screw the shame and guilt. Who CARES if you fail, we will get up and do it again and we will learn something that may save a life one day. Happens for a reason. But it in no way reflects how amazing we’ve all done to have gotten this far, and (I have to remind myself too) a fail does NOT mean you will be any less worthy to work with animals and love what you do. 

Soooo long story short I’m panicking and feeling nauseous with all of you every time my email gives me a notification!

Budget-Clerk-7282,"Like another poster said, 'loop mee' with a few veterinarians. Preferably several different ones. Every veterinarian and practice is different. You can also check out vets for different species, like horses, exotics, birds, companion, veearts etc. This exploration of the actual daily job beforehand is important. A lot of students quit, because it is way different than expected. It's not just cuddling puppies. It's a lot of working with humans too, and sad and frustrating moments. It's also amazing if you enjoy biology, medicine, learning how the body works etc. It's also very afwisselend, not a 9-5 sit on a desk chair kind of job. There are a lot of job options, so you could explore further what you like when studying. Many vets switch at least once between jobs like food industry, research or between different species.

The job is rewarding but tough, the same goes for the studies. Go to the open days in Utrecht and Belgium. Remember getting in is hard as well, have a plan b. I think there is still an option to switch to the master veterinarian medicine if you finish the bachelor animal sciences in Wageningen and choose a specific course. 
You could go for Ghent or Antwerp too, but those courses are quite tough on Dutch students, because of the cultural differences and differences in school systems. If you're good at studying loads of info in ridiculous detail, Belgium could suit you though. Unfortunately, they have an entrance exam now, which is very hard to pass. So prepare to study hard for that test if you go that road.

It's definitely not a requirement, but if you manage to find some side job related to animals or even at a veterinarian practice, you can get used to different animal species and also see what interests you.

I hope I don't sound too negative. If this is the job for you, it's gonna be amazing and you'll love it. You will succeed if you put your mind to it. Good luck!","Veterinarian.

Present-Diamond7994,"I am licensed in Korea and in USA.

In Korea, you go straight to vet school after high school and you spend 6 years at the vet school to become a vet (GP). And the degree is not a doctorate. In USA, you have to go to college and complete prerequisite courses first in order to be able to apply for the vet school. College undergrad degree is not required but many students get bachelor’s degree before going into vet school. Once you graduate from the vet school, you are a doctor (the degree is called Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine).

I’ve seen enough from my own institution that I knew the lifestyle wasn’t for me and quite frankly, shouldn’t be for anyone. Additionally, something you said stood out to me - that “some may be bitter that their time, money and respect was stolen from them and would like others to experience how it feels”. I’ve witnessed this myself; veterinarians both boarded and non-boarded have expressed doubt in my decision to not pursue an internship. Almost as if it’s a rite of passage to experience such conditions.

JustNaNaNa,"What do YOU want in a practice? Most new grads don’t stay with their first practice for more than a year because they followed the money or some other reason.

Some things I made clear I wanted as a new grad was mentorship above all else. If that’s important to you, make sure you bring it up. If they say they don’t offer it, thank them for their time and move on.

Is work culture important to you? Some vet clinics historically have toxic work culture. Is the turnover rate for support staff high? Are they always hiring? Those are red flags for me. Search up the companies you are being hired with on indeed or glass door to see if there have been good experiences for employees. If you have the option, ask to follow them around for the day. Listen to how the support staff talk when the vets aren’t around. Do you want a family close knit team or what have you. 

Work life balance important? Many new grads are focusing more on work life balance and a lot of companies are trying to get more vets by offering 4 day work weeks or 3 day work weeks. 

Do you hate surgery? Find a practice that allows you to never do surgery. My friend hates surgery and has found a GP that allows them to just see GP/urgents. 


Whatever region you’re working in, a quick google search can help find a rough “average” salary of a vet. Do some searches on Reddit to see if anyone posted about the salary they make. 
Big city? More than likely over 6 figure salary. Some rural area? Maybe mid to high 5 figure. (Assuming US) — also depends if you’re small animal only, mixed, or large.

If you have to move, calculate what would be an adequate moving bonus (how much would it cost you to uproot your stuff and move) 

Signing bonuses for new grades range from 0-50k I’ve seen from my colleagues. 


Sit down and think what YOU want in a practice and what’s more important to you. If you’re in North America it is basically an employee market and you have a lot of negotiating power because of the high burn out and companies desperately needing vets.","Other.

kklaudai,"Love this! Good luck on your journey! Age and maturity are definitely an advantage, my worries was only about merging school and real adult life (house, car, bills). Many students have chance to live at parents and just study having maybe weekend job for own expenses. I never had this opportunity and that reason (and mentality ofc) stopped me from going to study earlier. Thank you for your words!Thank you for your input. You definitely can be proud of yourself! Congrats 🙌Thank you! Fingers crossed and wish you all the best! That’s true, I learned a lot and been in a lot of jobs where often I was underestimated because of my age. I just can’t see myself doing “whatever job” forever. My life is all about animals and always was, now after loosing my best friend of 13yrs my will to become a veterinarian is even stronger…I do walk and dogs, volunteer in the shelter as well. I am aware how hard and responsible job of veterinarian is. I never worked in that field but I have 13years of regular visits and a lot of different clinics. I spoke with some veterinarians during my visits and a lot of them admit that is “hard as hell”. Tho it doesn’t demotivate me, I was always the responsible one and my hunger for knowledge doesn’t leave me with peace. 
I don’t want to sound like I’m telling about myself in a superlatives, but if it comes to stress in my life I had really a lot and enough, starting from family issues, going through job issues, immigration, abuse and lack of financial freedom. I really feel “prepared” and went through little more than average shit in my life.
If it comes to my burn out, is clearly the effect of my commitment to a job I didn’t even like, sweating my ass off for 2,5yrs resulting only in getting more and more responsibilities and tasks without any pay back.Ahhh warms my heart!!! Be proud of yourself, I really admire people following their dreams! It definitely motivates me and I’m happy I’m not the only one who got to the senses late haha. You say you’re working 30hrs, is it full paid or just internship? If I may ask, what’s your living situation? Are you handling bills/payments together with studying?That speaks to me! You are right, I sometimes forget I’m not 20yo anymore. Time goes by anyway!Yeah that’s the thing I have to dive into. I finished school in the other country and I want to study in The Netherlands. Definitely have to do my research, but now I think I’d be able to wait one more year to eventually complete all needed pre-exams or whatever and start studying next year. What is one year compared to all lifetime, right?Sure. What would the life be without challenges? 😁Thanks! Very motivating! Congrats for taking the risk and handling so well! I can’t imagine myself participating corporation rat race till my retirement. I needed those years of work to convince myself that it isn’t for me. All the best to you!That’s so motivating!! Thank youCheers!🍻💛That’s great team work you guys are doing! Awesome! I’m surely more mature than I was 5 years ago, I also feel like I convinced myself through my working years that this isn’t how I want to live the life. We all need to know our purpose on this planet and mine becomes more and more clear to me. So grateful for that. Wishing you all the best, you’re doing fantastic 🌹","Veterinarian.

usernameTH1S,"I agree with the principle of this letter, but devils advocate, some of this is just not really true. At least not everywhere. I went through internship and finished residency last year, and have also been part of the intern selection committee several times including this past year.
- my residency was private practice with expectation to work for them after, and I did not get a low ball offer. I interviewed and looked at some other non corp positions just to see, and they made the same or worse offers. I felt like my hospital really wanted me to stay and was actually very competitive even with the expectation I would stay. 
- salaries: definitely suck but outside of academia, seem to be getting better every year. VCAs are paying interns $80k I believe which is definitely livable. I’m biased bc in California intern salaries are regulated by min wage laws but definitely not true everywhere so for sure could be better. 
- Quality of life: also can definitely suck, but my impression is there is a consistent trend towards more sustainable intern life. My hospital (and I think all programs in the area) have 2 guaranteed days off, and actually get 3 in a row off when they are on ER (they work 4 days/week). Don’t get me wrong there is certainly room for improvement but it is definitely better even than when I was an intern. 
- selection process: I can only speak to the intern selection but it is 100% merit based. I put in probably 30 hours each VIRMP season reviewing/interviewing applicants and then a huge meeting to decide on rank order. It is very unbiased I would say, we just want good people that will succeed in our hospital and will hopefully get out of it what they were looking for. 

I know my experience is not everyone else’s and there should be improvements. But the verbiage of this letter does not reflect my experience in a great many ways.Male DACVECC in San Diego CA. $225k base with 25% pooled production, total $250-270k range. Busy hospital. 5 days CE and $4500 CE allowance. 5 weeks PTO/1week sick.3x 12hrs day shifts. Mostly weekdays, occ Sunday. Sometimes working 4 shifts/week (short staffed), prob twice every couple months.Agreed there is no best 😕 the most consistent thing you will hear is that it is location dependent - local hospital management and often the regional management. For example I work at a VCA hospital and for the most part feels the least “corporate-y” of the ones I have experience with, but when I fill in at other VCA hospitals I get the gross corporate ick. Ultimately no easy answer you really have to go hospital by hospital.Two things
1) You’re being too hard on yourself, and EVERYONE has the sense of “imposter syndrome” at some point (usually many points) of their training/career. I’m a ER/critical care specialist and very confident in my skills/knowledge, but even so once in a while I still find myself thinking “these people seem smarter than me”. Just push through it because it’s all in our heads 🙂
2) Being “smart” is over rated as far as vet and med school goes. Yes your life is easier if you have a good memory or naturally good critical thinking skills, but that is 10% of undergrad/vet school. 90% of it is discipline and study skills, which it sounds like you have. Honestly the fact that you’re even thinking about it this far ahead is a good sign. I was still trying to figure out how I learn best in vet school.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

fitvetdrgene,"I am sorry that I didn't read your whole post, clinical practice posts just give me PTSD bouts. Here are few options
1) join the administrative side of veterinary practice in veterinary hospital/ chains
2) Can work as a technical officer in pet companies like pet food, supplements, Pharma, derma, shampoos,creams and stuff. You can be someone who bridges gap between research and development team, marketing and sales team....I worked in product management and I was not fan of the work or how the company marketed few products but boy, the pay was amazing and the work life balance was out of the universe
3) you can work for CDC in one health positions
4) you can work in public health organizations focusing on one health, emerging diseases
5) if you don't have a lot of debt ( vet school) you can pursue a masters too.
6) you can try getting into research there are some interesting research programs depending upon your area of interest there is biomedical engineering for veterinary medicine, microbiology, Genetics, poultry.

All the best, may you find something which gives you peace.I don't want which country you are in, but the answers look like USA. You can Google Exotic animal clinics in your state or even your country. You can message the vets via LinkedIn, many have great insta profiles. I worked in a different country in exotic animal hospital. 75% of our clients were exotics - turtles, tortoises, snakes, iguanas, birds, rabbits, guinea figs, hamsters etc. My colleague who was the practice owner has been in USA to shadow some vets who had 100% exotic practice.... I think establishing a 100% Exotic practice takes time but you can do it. Douglas Mader, is one of the most famous exotic vets out there. I remember in college I had mailed at least 50 only exotic animal hospitals in the USA asking for preceptorship experience.

DiamondDry5638,"Annoys me the most? Clients, just clients. Stresses me the most? The entirety of being a vet. I spend my days being anxious I made a misdiagnosis or on what I could've done better, or that some asshole will sue me and make me lose my license because I couldn't save their 22 year old cat with a malignant cancer with just 35$.I completely disagree with the reply above mine. ""Try not to get suicidal and go take on an even more stressful night shift job that'll isolate you"", is a bad piece of advice. 

I'm sorry you're feeling this way. I also graduated in 2023 and have I've also been trying to get out of vet med entirely but there's not much out there except clinical practice, no matter what people tell you. 

I hated my first job so much, I had severe anxiety and panic attacks before going into work and actually got burned out after just 5 months of practice. My environment was super toxic. I finally switched and started at another clinic very recently, it's been so much better. Yes I still have anxiety over all my medical cases and scared to lose my license every other day, but I have better mentorship, better schedules and an overall better work environment. I made a similar post as yours a few months back and everyone told me to try out another 1-2 clinics before quitting, and honestly, it makes a difference. Try out something else with better mentorship if you think you're making bad decisions/diagnostics. After sticking it out at another job, if you truly hate it, then find an alternate path. That's what I'm currently doing, I do believe I don't actually love being a vet and will not be doing this my entire life, but my mental health sure as hell is better since I quit the other job!Honestly I feel you so much. Wanted to be a vet since I was 3, graduated last june. I hate it everyday, I have always had a little bit of anxiety but always managed it and it never impaired on my daily life, but since I started working, I've been having severe anxiety every single day, imposter syndrome, scared of every little mistake/thing I forgot, scared of getting a board complaint and losing my license every other day. Most days I come home and stare at the ceiling rethinking my days or checking my files making sure no client called back and all the pets are fine. My boyfriend talks to me and I don't answer/hear him cause I'm overthinking.

proximalhistadine,"why? 
mr. krabs said it best-
MONEY!

look at the tuition of these schools and tell me that’s not the primary motivator. 

rural vet shortage? nope
not enough vets in general? nope
the actual desire to create truly competent and confident veterinarians? nopeeeee


just like with many other professions- there are no shortages of people, there are shortages of people willing to put up with the bullshit for the pay. 

don’t get me started on the fucking “mid level” position that keeps getting thrown out there. rightttt bc you have new vets that can’t handle a blocked cat or HBC dog or do a fat dog spay without crying (bc they only do half a fucking spay in school) but you want to create a new position to make things better?

yeah. that’ll fix it. the medical professions are a fucking dumpster fire.  inadequate grads? jfc. no. the schools are inadequate. that’s the problem. 

let’s look at dog spays- the most common procedure by far. how many new grads can confidently say they can perform a dog spay? that’s a problem. it’s more of a problem when schools don’t give students the resources they need to learn the skills. and yes, you can get into all kinds of arguments about what’s important and isn’t. but at the end of the day, students are not prepared for the basics. 


take a poll- how many spays did you perform in vet school, as part of the curriculum? it’s disgustingly low. 

but schools want to add more students to increase class size but not increase the quality of education. it’s NOT the students fault. the students, and all vets, and pet owners and the meat eating public, deserve better. that’s the argument. 

we teach students as if they were mds where they then go into residency. however, that’s the exception not the rule for our side. so students get thrown into the wild, unprepared,  while the schools just pump out more new grads. it’s unfair and predatory (see: tuition fees of the newest schools)

 way to miss the boat i’m a leftie surgeon. i only use right-handed instruments. we all grew up up in a right handed world so i just dealt with it- and you no doubt did as well.

personally i HATE left-handed scissors. in residency, one of my mentors was a leftie, and she forced me for a two weeks to use them, just to try it out. and i hated it then as well. but that’s what it’s about- comfort. so see what works and you do you!usa, (but did vet school in australia). 

midline. i have done flank. i just don’t like it. also- if there is some sort of abnormality, and you need to extend the incision, everything inside the abdomen is gonna be “off” as you aren’t used to doing a lateral approach for anything but the spay.hi- surgeon here (non-boarded), who has spent a lot of time in shelters and academia in my career. 

&#x200B;

A. cat spay- ovarian pedicle tie on EVERY cat. yes, even pregnant ones. uterine body (single miller's knot), body wall (single inverted cruciate), skin (buried cruciate). larger incisions (pregnant cats)- continuous pattern in the body wall)

 the rigdon-brestle paper had almost 16,000 cats (SIXTEEN THOUSAND- no vet study has that kind of power, we are lucky to get to 100 on a good day) that were spayed with pedicle ties with a minuscule complication rate. this included students performing the spays. pedicle ties are INCREDIBLY safe. remember, ""time is trauma."" the more time spent under anesthesia, the higher the rate of complications. and as i said earlier- i use it on pregnant cats and pyometras as well. cat vessels are very small with no fat on them.  the humane alliance has good videos, as does youtube. you might even find some of my instructional videos if you look hard enough  ;) 

&#x200B;

B. Cat neuter- cord tie/pedicle tie. scrotal. no sutures at all. i aim for closed, but sometimes the tunic is opened and then it becomes open, but whatever. 

&#x200B;

C. dog spay- single miller's knot on ovarian pedicles (have toyed with auto ligation on a  few puppies, but never have as they aren't near as distensible as cats; however, i bet there a select few where it could work). the uterine body gets either a miller's knot (small dogs/puppies) or a double modified transfixation ligature (i tie a modified transfixation ligature on one side, then perform that on the contralateral side). continuous in the skin (or inverted cruciate if the dog is small enough for a single ligature to close the body wall).  then subq and skin (intradermal)

&#x200B;

D. dog neuter- pre-scrotal. closed.  single miller's knot on cord. subq and skin closed in two layers= inverted cruciate and then a buried cruciate or continuous and intradermal, depending on size

D1- young small breeds- i will autoligate the cords after making a transverse incision across the scrotum. skin closed  with skin glue

D3- there is a paper out there regarding scrotal castrations in adults dogs and it mentions leaving the skin open. DO NOT DO THIS. clients get awfully upset as this leaks fluids for days. i had a vet that did this and had to have her stop bc of so many client complaints. i think a scrotal approach is totally fine, but close the skin in dogs. 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

as far as suture - remember, we need to think about the strength of sure and how long it lasts. monocryl (polilgecaprone-25) is functionally gone in like 2 weeks (50% of it's tensile strength is lost in that time) so it is NOT appropriate for the body wall fascia as failure leads to small hernias or catastrophic failure with guts falling on the floor  at worst. it's great where you don't need it to last as long (completely absorbed in 3-4 months)- so subq and skin. also great for bladders and intestines. PDS (polydioxannone) last a longggg time (50% tensile strength in 6 weeks and complete absorption in 6 months). so it's great for fascia, not so great for intradermals. not bad per se, but not great. for dog spays, i will happily use two packs of suture (PDS for the pedicles/uterus and body wall and monocryl for sub and skin). however, for cat spays, as i only tie three ligatures, i will put PDS in the skin bc that's a waste to open two packs.   


and just to add confusion,  i actually use biosyn (gylcomer 631) and maxon (polyglyconate), coviden's answer to monocryl and PDS, respectively. biosyn gives you three weeks before 50% of the tensile strength is lost, and maxon has the same dissolution characteristics (though it's not as ""smooth"") as PDS. and maxon actually has better knot security by a small margin compared to PDS). one of the big reasons why i use these sutures in my clinic is the cost. these are human-grade sutures, unlike that cheap-ass generic PDS and monocryl (like one-dox, one-cryl, etc). i hate that generic shit- the cartridges suck and lock up, the dye comes off on your cloves. it's really shitty suture. AND biosyn and maxon are often the same price, or cheaper as the knock off pds/monocryl. 

&#x200B;

hope that helpsi think they put the fear of gut into you so you don't use it on the body wall. it will fall apart way too fast for something that needs strength for a long time (fascia). but for ligation of vessels- totally fine. it even incites a little inflammatory reaction as it's broken down to make a more ""secure"" ligation.  i don't use it myself, but again, for simple vessel ligation, there's nothing wrong with it.not appropriate for the body wall, absolutely.

 ask yourself- how long does a ligature on a few vessels NEED to be there? 6 months (as with PDS)? no.

and they still sell it, even on the human side. it's not poison. 

 what about polilgactin 910 (vicryl)? it's super soft, and i love it in oral mucosa for that very reason, but it doesn't last long.  it would be inappropriate to put it in the body wall (just like gut). 

using the wrong suture in the wrong location is like prescribing the wrong med for a condition. you need to know your tools and where they go. that's when you get in trouble.","Veterinarian.

Popular_Taro_5344,"This! I worked at a very toxic practice in high school and externed at a couple more, but the clinic I ended up taking a job with is wonderful. Theres definitely still rough days, and clients aren't always easy to deal with, but I've got a team that supports me, two amazing mentors, and when I bring up concerns they're heard and addressed quickly. Just like any job, good management makes a huge difference. 

As far as the financial aspect goes, it's scary but it is doable. Most of my friends in my graduating class have bought houses. My husband and I live comfortably without going above our means. I'm mindful about our budget, but I don't have to stress out about it constantly. 

For me, becoming a vet was very worth it. And while there are definitely issues in the field, I also know that I can be part of changing this industry for the better by promoting a healthier clinic environment, standing up for my technicians, teaching with compassion and not getting angry, being open about mental health and working with movements like NOMV to help push for positive changes.Likely some combination.   


I graduated with two offers from placed Id done externships at, one offer from a place I worked at in high school and had several recruiters reach out to me on linked in with what I would call ""soft"" offers (aka offers pending an actual interview)  


Realistically, I personally wouldn't consider any offers from places you are unable to do an externship or at the very least a visit with a ""working"" interview, because then you really don't know what you're walking into. I only seriously considered two of the offers and even then, I knew already which clinic I preferred and it was just a matter of making sure they could match the numbers from the other clinic.   


If you're anything like me, I know I was really stressing about employment, but with the state of things right now, you should try not to worry too much or get too ahead of yourself. Now is a good time to be thinking about what you want in a practice and trying to find places that fit that list to visit or extern at.","Veterinarian.

Vet_Sci_Guy,"Honestly, it’s tough to do on your own. Most of my class has financial help, either from parents/fam or a spouse/SO. I don’t have any financial help outside of student loans so I can tell you from my experience.. 
student loans aren’t enough to live on alone. At least at my school/location (Tufts- one of the most expensive schools & an insane COL in the area) my student loans essentially cover my rent & car insurance for the semester. I work 20 hrs/wk in the ER at my schools hospital to make ends meet, which is also the minimum # of hours I need to work to get food stamps in my state. Food stamps/EBT is huge, I couldn’t stay afloat without it. 
It’s just tough sometimes. I don’t have anything extra, I’ve had car issues a couple times & it’s stressful as hell figuring out how I’m gonna pay my rent at the end of the semester.

NoSite3062,"Absolutely gotta study for this trash exam!The day I decided being an RVT wasn't for me was the day I found out I was getting paid the same as the employees at In-n-Out. No shade to them, I'd much rather do that job for the pay than mine. It sucks.I mean it's kind of important to find out if there's a better job posting site that clinics are using in the area. I'm sure regions have different websites they prefer to advertise on. It is pretty important to know if that's truthful as the average home cost in the area is nearing $400k for a complete shit hole, and renting is requiring 4x the monthly rent as your income cuts it pretty close if not impossible for a veterinarian to live up there. Vets are needed everywhere and this is not feasible.Haha yeah, I know. My old 600sq ft little dump just sold for $315k in Lakewood, originally bought in 2016 and sold in 2018 for far less than that. It's a mess.First semester was humiliating, humbling, and annoying. Second semester got way better. I too failed a few tests first semester until I figured out flashcards worked best to study from. I was too busy trying to understand the content and apply it clinically which is the best way to learn for retention. Unfortunately, with the firehose-level of material, I had to step down to something a little less quality and learn by repetition.

It's disappointing coming from an educational background. But it worked best for me. No failures in second or third semester, heading into fourth in a week or so! Good luck, you got this!I got paid a TON less working as an experienced RVT at my university. It also varied greatly by dept. ER RVTs were getting $19/hr and the anesthesia RVTs were getting $27+/hr. Same with our ICU. It was abysmal.It was a means to an end as I'm going to the same school for vet school. But many friends and coworkers did not stay long. The turnover is the same. A lot of money that felt like it didn't spread to us, unfortunately. But that just could be because my state doesn't put a huge emphasis on RVTs.Hi there! RVT to vet student here. Your experience hours and letters of rec are going to be your strong suits in this case. I took a year off to knock out my pre-reqs, and only my pre-reqs. I don't even have a bachelor's degree. However, being an RVT I do have an associate's degree. They're going to want to see that you can keep up with the GPA in undergrad and for the pre-reqs, because you're going to be taking 20+ credits of hard science in vet school. It is harrowing how tough it is sometimes. 

If you live at home, Pell grants are based on your parents' income if you aren't considered an independent student. You'd have to look into if you're considered an independent student based on FAFSA - I got a lot of help from Pell grants in tech school. I don't think you get Pell grants in vet school. Also you don't get subsidized student loans here. So even if you do have to take out a student loan to get your prereqs/degree, it's worth it.

Let me put it this way: I was a 3.9 gpa with a 3.8 or so science gpa. I am now a B student in vet school. You'll have to be prepared for getting lower grades than usual but know that your clinical experience will help you flourish during your clinical year. 

I'd also like to add that working during vet school was not a way to go for me. Some of my friends are working and their grades are suffering.Sure, but if you already did poorly on a required course for vet school, why get yourself stuck in a position now having to put this course on VMCAS when the time comes if you do worse?

I'm not saying this is a bad idea, it just seems like maybe retaking a course you've got some familiarity with and doing better should be the better option.

Edit: the parent comment was deleted but it is crucial to know that vet schools have SPECIFIC prerequisite requirements. Parent comment was suggesting OP take a higher course level than the class they needed to repeat for a better GPA. Do not do this.If they can't do well in undergrad science courses your advice is to take...harder undergrad science courses? Not trying to pick this apart but it's hard enough to get in and not all admissions are built the same.I was a UA Butter Soft girly before Figs.

Sad-Rhubarb1988,"I am sorry you’re going through this, it does sound like a very toxic workplace. 

I agree with what many above have said, but one question I had is are you constantly voicing these comparisons you’re making about yourself/your outcomes and the other vets in the workplace? This can contribute to why people are treating you rudely. No one likes it when their colleagues are being thrown under the bus. Hindsight is always 20/20, and something you may have now “caught” is not necessarily something your colleague has “missed.” If you are seeing these cases and sharing with everyone how you caught something they missed etc etc, that behavior can be off putting to them. If you’re constantly telling people you have no complications but so and so sutured omentum outside of the abdomen, then again this won’t be received well. Complications will happen to everyone, it doesn’t matter how perfectly you did everything. Something may be obvious to you at a second recheck but during the initial evaluation it was not as obvious to whoever saw it first. Please remember that, because it is never the intention of any of our colleagues to miss something, misdiagnose something, or contribute to surgical complications. 

You should bring up the rude comments your staff has made with whoever their supervisor is. If you have concerns about the other veterinarians in the practice, then it is something you can discuss with the medical director. 

I am not saying how they are treating you is ok (because it’s not). When a practice hires a new grad, there is an expectation of some sort of learning curve, need for mentorship, being slower than more proficient and experienced doctors, etc. All the staff should be used to this, and should be on board.","Veterinarian.

Far-Assignment-733,"If you want to be a legit “zoo veterinarian” who works at major AZA accredited zoos in large cities, there’s tons of training involved. You’ll need your DVM (generally 4 years) where you’ll learn almost nothing about zoo species. You’ll also need a 1 year rotating internship and possibly a 1 year speciality internship, followed by a 3 year residency to actually get trained in how to do zoo animal medicine since vet school will mostly teach you dog-cat-equine-and some food animal. Zoo veterinarians don’t get payed well at all, and from what I’ve heard, the work-life balance isn’t great either. Also, the residency programs are among the most competitive programs for any speciality in veterinary medicine (I think the acceptance rate is like 3% or around there most years). If you want to work at backyard zoos, you just need a DVM, and not the other stuff (ie board certification). Not trying to be discouraging, but zoologic medicine is definitely one of the hardest if not the hardest field to break into and to stay in within veterinary medicine.I’m a 3rd year veterinary student who is considering small animal specialty practice. There are just so many problems with internship/residency right now. Obviously the pay at most of these programs is just terrible. Not sure how someone is expected to live on $35-$38k/year in a mid-sized city or urban area. You literally won’t get approved for an apartment. I also really think there needs to be more help for couples who are looking to apply to the match during the same cycle. They have this in human medicine. I guess our relationships don’t matter.I would think no unless there was reason to assume they would abuse the medication and you dispensed it anyways.I’m currently a 3rd year student at an AVMA accredited institution that also has a teaching hospital. I definitely agree with you that this is a problem. New vet schools popping up everywhere that don’t actually have the resources to properly educate students. I can only hope that the AVMA continues to be highly selective with which programs receive accreditation.There are so many problems with the veterinary professional associate proposal. Who in their right mind is gonna go and get a masters degree to be a glorified vet tech? Also, the idea that a DVM would be legally responsible for the VPA’s performance is terrifying. Being a veterinarian is already one of the most stressful jobs you could have as evidenced by the high suicide rate. Making vets legally responsible for the mistakes of unqualified pseudo-doctors would increase veterinarians’ stress levels significantly. The answer to the vet shortage question is to improve and expand the pool of DVM programs, not create these weird new positions.There is already a critical shortage of veterinarians in the United States. This shortage is projected to continue to get worse and worse. If you pay vets less, that’s not exactly going to help the situation.Focus on getting into vet school first. Once you’re in vet school, you can start to think about specialties. I thought I knew what I wanted to do going into vet school, but it turned out not to be the case.A couple of things here. First, a lot of places use the pro-sal model for compensating associates, including new grads. This means that salary is only one part of your income. If you look at the most recent AVMA annual survey (https://www.avma.org/news/veterinary-starting-salaries-rise-2023-educational-debt-holds-steady), the average starting compensation for new grads in small animal is $133k. So, what you really need to be looking at is what is the compensation structure that is being offered. Is it $100k straight salary, or is it $100k with 21% production on top of that? Big difference between the two. Also, job ads are just that, job ads. A clinic can offer whatever they want on indeed…doesn’t mean anyone is going to sign for that. I’m always surprised by the number of posts we get on this subreddit from practice managers and recruiters who don’t understand what compensation is considered industry-standard nowadays. Bottom line is, veterinarians are in extremely high demand right now as there is a nation-wide shortage. If I was a new grad going into small animal (unless planing to work in a very rural or low-cost of living area) I would not even entertain any offers with starting salary of less than $120k. New grads often don’t make very much in production on top of that because they aren’t super efficient. Once you start producing enough billings to earn production incentives, you should be looking anywhere in the $150k-200k range for an experienced associate unless in a very rural or poor area.According to data from the AVMA, in small animal practice, the average compensation for a new graduate is $133k/year now. So 100k for a new grad is kind of the absolute minimum.Becoming a licensed vet tech does not take 4 years of full-time schooling.The point of my comment was not to suggest that I think LVT pay is adequate, it is not.I could be wrong since I am a small animal person (vet student), but this is what I know. You really don’t need to specialize to work with food animals generally speaking. There are far fewer food animal vets than there are small animal vets in the United States, so there are going to be more opportunities of all kinds for small animal-related things. Making traditional internships and residencies required to work in a field with a huge shortage of vets already would be a terrible idea for obvious reasons. Additionally, I don’t think that most producers would necessarily pay more for the services of a “specialist” than a regular veterinarian, so spending several years after graduation in training financially wouldn’t make sense for new vets.

If you look on the VIRMP (https://www.virmp.org) it does appear that there are internships and residency opportunities available in food animal medicine. My guess is that these are really designed for people who want to go into academia/research more so than for folks to want to go into practice, but they do exist.

There are specialist certifications you can get through ABVP in beef, dairy, and food animal. However, since these are through ABVP, it’s done through a clinical route rather than a traditional residency program.
Here is a link to the AVMA recognized specialties. https://www.avma.org/education/veterinary-specialties

There are lots of ways you can learn about food animal medicine beyond just what you are doing in vet school. I don’t know what program you are at, but most programs have various food animal clubs that participate in activities such as palpations and pregnancy checks, lambing, calving, farm call ride- alongs, etc. They also have guest speakers who are knowledgeable in the field. I would look into opportunities like these to learn more during your didactic years of vet school.I’ve taken about the same number (a few more) but they were spread out more than yours were thankfully.It really depends on the program you are in and how efficient you are with your studying. In general, I wouldn’t plan on being able to work any more than like 8-10 hours a week unless you do not value sleep or sanity.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment was written by a veterinary student, but it contains detailed information about veterinary medicine and surgical techniques,",Medical Doctor

Benefits are ok, though I got pressured into a prosal contract with negative accrual and they refused to offer anything else so I’m not happy about that.

MeFolly,"Remember, common things occur commonly. Work on getting proficient at the things you will see all the time in your practice setting. Learn the presentation, how to explain to the client, the treatments, the medications, and most importantly when something is not right about the picture.  

The uncommon things, you look up. Use algorithms, use mentors, use on-line resources while you are in the clinic.Try looking for apps that show 3-d anatomy models. There are a number that are free at a basic level.Personally, I have always found dealing with the devastated people, who I don’t know how to help, harder than dealing with suffering patients, who I can help. 

As others have said, start looking around. Try to find a way to shadow in general practice, med/surg specialties, alternatives like behavioral medicine, and so on.  Volunteer where you can. Try a part time job if you think you might fit there and can get one, doing filing and cage cleaning if you have to while you train. 

Keep asking questions, but perhaps make them more directed. What makes this the practice or specialty for you? What do you find most difficult and most rewarding here?  What did you try that you did not like and why? 

Maybe you will end up in a specialty like dermatology where patients rarely die, and the people who stick with their care are devoted to them. Maybe you will end up in shelter medicine, where there are happy adoptions and fewer grieving owners among the sad stories. Maybe you will carve out your own niche. 

The opportunities are many. The challenges are real.These services might be handled by a GP, but it is rare for them to have enough time to deal with them thoroughly. There may be a skilled and trained staff member to cover those consultations, but it is a big ask

IMHO, it would be possible to build a practice around hospice, with a few caveats. You would have to be willing and able in your area to charge what your time is worth. It would have to be at least part-time mobile, to do household and lifestyle management consultations justice.

You would have to build a very trusting relationship with local practitioners and specialists. It would be vital to getting referrals. You would also have to figure out how much monitoring you could do without alienating them, and how often you would have to defer to having the primary do the lab work and imaging. You would have to have a partner clinic as a base, or ‘visiting’ privileges worked out with the primary for if/when hospitalization were needed. 

You would have to figure out a way to get the patients home treatment, where the owners were not able to do it but are willing to pay. This might be your staff or working with the primary clinic’s staff to set up home care. 

The emotional toll would be immense. You would be bonding with animals who are going to die imminently and the people who love them. You would need to be available pretty much 24/7. 

For me, I might see providing hospice care as part of a high-end, high quality mobile practice, but not as a full time gig. Gotta have some happy kittens and puppies and some success stories to keep your going.If you are in the US you are required to abide by ALARA - as low as reasonably achievable.  You are required to wear a dosimeter and lead protection for hands, thyroid and body. 

Any animal that can be safely sedated and positioned with straps or sand bags, should be. No person should hold an anesthetized animal as they can be passively positioned 

If you must be in the room, reduce your exposure by measuring and positioning carefully, so no repeat exposures are needed.

Wear all the protective gear. Wear protective glasses, or ask your optician about getting lenses for your daily wear glasses  that will protect you

NEVER get under the primary beam. NEVER

Keep as much of yourself as possible as far away as possible from the primary beam and from the patient, who produces most of the scatter radiation.  Lean back; do not lean into or on the table. 

Close your eyes at the moment of exposure.  If not wearing protective lenses turn your head away. 

If you are, or think you may be, pregnant, there are special regulations that you and your employer must follow. Failure to follow them can result in large fines and removal of the radiation safety license. In some states at some times, no female of childbearing age was allowed in the room during the actual exposure, just in case.Practice practice practice. 

This sound weird but. Make some undercooked penne pasta. Practice ligating it until your knot is snug and won’t slip but does not cut through the pasta. It gives you the feedback of tissue failure. Well sort of. 

As you progress, try tying off different times of pasta in different types of pasta. When you can tie a snug knot that indents a strand of overcooked thin spaghetti without cutting through it,  a feline pedicle will be less dauntingSometimes a surgery will bleed.

GandalfTheDVM,"The non-traditional path of practicing for a few years before pursuing residency is really not an option anymore for competitive specialities like surgery. They want applicants who do the traditional path of vet school, rotating internship, specialty internship, residency. 

You will be poor during your training, but private practice surgeons can easily make 400k or more per year. You’ll get those loans paid off if you’re smart with the finances.Find a professor who does research that you would be interested in working with. Most of them have ideas for small projects that vet students can get a published paper out of. Or you may come up with an idea of your own that a professor is willing to help you with.  Most vet schools offer research grants or will have information about external grants that students can apply for, that way you get paid for your time and for any equipment you might need. 

Some schools might give you elective time for research projects but most of the work for it is going to be on your own time. It's a great thing to use a Summer break for.Not likely. Surgical oncology in vet med is probably very research focused. I doubt that there is a large enough demand for that level of expertise in private practice to be able to both exclusively practice as a surgical oncologist and make more than someone performing a much more diverse array of procedures. 

If you were to do the advanced training in surgical oncology but also still perform TPLOs and ex-laps, and fracture repairs etc, then you could probably negotiate a higher base salary, but the amount of money that a vet surgeon makes is largely based on the number of procedures they’re doing each day.

Academia is a different story, but you will never make as much in academia as you will in private practice.Cardiology is one of the most competitive specialties. She will definitely have to do a rotating internship and very likely will have to do a specialty internship as well.

I think that while in school, research is always a smart move especially if she can get a publication out of it. Ultimately getting a residency is largely about who you know, how much they like you, their connections and the strength of their reference letters. The more time she can spend at a location with cardiologists, preferably a place with a residency program, the better.Probably a solid plan but it would also be beneficial to extern at universities or private practices with residency programs that she may want to consider for her rotating internship.Vet med is a small world, particularly amongst specialists.

Budgie_Smuggler24,"I'm on the PSLF route and I work in the non-profit vet world (think shelter medicine, high quality high volume spay/neuter). I cannot imagine doing anything else. All I've ever wanted to be is a vet. It's been a bumpy ride. I'm 8 years out and have finally figured out how to make this work for me mentally, physically, etc. 

  
1. You have to be thinking about loans and actively make a plan as to how you're gonna pay them back. This also requires a lot of self-study about finances, loans, paperwork etc  (I realized PSLF and doing non-profit work was a win-win for me but I sustained a lot of workplace trauma trying to find the right fit. There's annual paperwork involved.  I'm committed to 10 years of nonprofit/government work).  
2. You have to stand up for yourself, including leaving jobs you hate even when its hard to walk away; you need to know when you're being abused by your employer. You have to actively get yourself out of shitty situations that usually involve difficult people and sometimes money. It's awkward, there's lots of feelings, it sucks.   
3. Create a life outside of vet med. This sounds easy before you go to vet school, but studying and then post-grad learning/working consumes your life. You become used to working so hard, its naturally easy to just become a workaholic as there's always room for improvement. You have to find a healthy balance and maintain relationships or you will be unhappy.   


My days are now 32-40 hours a week. No on call. I can leave work at work most of the time. Lots of surgery and puppies/kittens, which I enjoy. I don't need to do it all anymore because I have and its burnt me out multiple times. I have found what I'm good at and don't bite off more than I can chew. If I could do it all over again I would have advocated for myself more. I would have trusted my intuition and quit jobs I knew weren't working for me, even if that meant breaking a contract or potentially living off savings for a bit.   


If you really wanna be a vet, you want to be a vet. There's no one that's gonna talk you out of it - but there's gonna be no one to ensure you maintain your wellness except for you.I feel you. I'm in high quality high volume low cost spay and neuter work and love it. It's been the most supportive and least toxic sector of vet med for me (did GP and several shelter stints). It was how I gained quality surgical skills (but most of all confidence!!). There are plenty of places and programs that will train you like ASPCA Spay/Neuter Alliance. Emancipet has an excellent training program for on the job surgical training. There's a huge demand for these services and some days are really mostly puppies and kittens.","Veterinarian.

Assuming someone has an average GPA and average vet hours (let’s say 3.5 GPA since that seems to be the average, and a normal amount of vet hours) what are the odds they get into vet school if they apply year after year to a variety of schools? I always hear about people giving up after about 2-3 cycles, but if they kept trying, would they statistically eventually get in?Thanks so much. I worked 3 years as a manager at Chick-fil-A throughout high school, so I definitely have a lot of customer service experience and am excited to implement it at the clinic!I should probably add that I have a lot of animal experience hours already with shadowing, working on farms, shelters, etc., so I understand how to handle animals (but am open to learning new handling methods at the clinic). I also wanted to add that this vet clinic’s entire staff i just going to be the vet, me, and the other assistant. It’s only a weekend only, small clinic, so I’m not just going to be shadowing, and the only experienced employee is the vet.

Giraffefab19,"I think OP is reasonable to be concerned about what the techs are saying and how the techs are treating them. The medical team has to be on the same page in order to effectively care for patients. Trust among team members is super important, and it seems to me like OP is getting the vibe that the techs don't trust them. That's a problem because the whole thing falls apart without the techs trusting the doctor. Is it also important for techs to give the doctor feedback and ask questions when something doesn't make sense? Absolutely. But there's a way that is done professionally and then there is whatever these techs are doing. You can't just walk up to a doctor, refuse to call them by their title, and imply they're an idiot all day... and then expect patient care to go well.You're feelings are valid and you are totally allowed to feel more emotionally connected with certain patients. Don't fight the feelings or feel like you ""shouldn't"" feel this way or that way about something.

I think it would be helpful for you to talk with someone about your anxiety and learn ways to manage it and work through it before starting vet school, especially because your anxiety may change over time. It might be about bites today, but it could be about something else tomorrow. It's important to gain the skills for how to recognize where your anxiety is coming from and how to work through it. I really buckled down and worked on my mental health between undergrad and vet school and it helped immensely!I'm at Virginia-Maryland and it can be a mixed bag but overall pretty good. We do big integrated classes that focus on body systems instead of discrete classes like anatomy, histopathology, etc. An example: the class is called ""Moving"" and focuses on the musculoskeletal system. You spend the first week learning anatomy and physiology of the appendicular skeleton for dogs, cats, and horses. Then the next weeks you start talking about the major issues affecting those structures and how to diagnose and treat them. It's very practical but sometimes feels rushed. The entire curriculum is set up so that important topics are revisited multiple times over the three years to increase your understanding. It works pretty well. I also liked getting to start clinics between second and third year. It gave me a good idea of what clinical year would be like and I loved my equine rotation so much that I decided to take more equine classes third year, which I really enjoyed.


The administration could really be a lot better about communicating things to the students. There's typically some chaos around scheduling and requirements being somewhat unclear whenever a deadline starts approaching. This is mostly because there are only two or three people managing all the correspondence with all the students so they're overwhelmed. They do their best and the communication issues usually doesn't cause any problems more than adding unnecessary stress to people. The curriculum design is good and effective but I'm finding the third year classes repetitive (which is the point) and a little boring. I suppose that's a good problem to have. Most of the rotations for clinical year are pretty good learning experiences with reasonable hours with a few notable exceptions where the faculty are super into academic hazing. My understanding is that administration is trying to crack down on them with little effect. I found a way to take other rotations instead since they were not required for me.I had looked at BP's but I didn't know Ethos had one! Thank you!I know VEG has an ER training program but I'm a little worried about drinking the Kool aid to get in with them. I've heard some horror stories 😬How did you go about finding somewhere with good mentorship? I mostly hear about new grads who sign a contract for a place that says they want to give mentorship and then end up holding the bag. Did you have a formalized program at your practice?This is really helpful, thank you! I think part of my reluctance to do an internship is because I really dislike my school's internship program - the doctors get basically no autonomy and are basically robots for their attending clinician. I don't feel like I can learn without being able to actually make decisions about cases, which our interns don't do. They basically just relay information to the resident or supervising doctor and type medical records. I would much rather be part of a program like you're describing where I can have some room to think through a case and make real decisions and also discuss them with colleagues and mentors with more experience than me.

I 100% agree that it can be hard to figure out when to refer. I've definitely seen plenty of that from non-VEG practices so it doesn't appear to be unique to themThanks for sharing! This helps :)Thank you!!I worked night shift as an LVT for a year. Here's my advice:

1. Try to stay up as late as you can the night BEFORE you start the overnight shifts and sleep as late into the day as possible the day of your first night shift.

2. Prepare for daytime sleep: Purchase blackout curtains for your bedroom or hang a heavy blanket over your window. Buy a good sleep mask. Pick up some melatonin at the drug store and take it right before you want to go to sleep. You are trying to convince your body it is night time.

3. I am very familiar with how my body deals with caffeine so I personally did not consume any caffeine 8 hours before the end of my shift so that I would definitely sleep when I got home.

4. Do not let a single person try to convince you to do anything after your shift or before your next shift. This time is for sleeping and it is SACRED. Protect it at all costs.

5. Try to eat at regular intervals similar to what your day time food schedule is. For example, if you eat right after you wake up normally then do that for your night shift too. If you would usually eat lunch about 5 hours after breakfast, try to eat something about 5 hours after your night time ""breakfast""


Those worked for me for a little over a year! I hope it helps!""sent them a few intractable land sharks for that""

🤣🤣 Good for you!I think you have two main options here. First, you could go to your practice manager or practice owner with specific issues that you have and some ideas on how to fix it. Put the issues in context of how it is not just impacting how you feel but how you are able to do your job. If the construction issues don't rise to the level of impacting your ability to do your job, don't be surprised if the bosses don't jump to make major changes. If you can clearly articulate what exactly is happening, how is impacts the job, and what you think would fix it or help, then you will probably get somewhere. The other option is to wait it out. Do you have an idea of when the construction will be done? Renovating a clinic is a huge pain in the ass for everyone involved but is often really worth it in the end. I would make a list of the things that are going on that are really bugging you. Then look at the list and try to determine ""can I live with this for x more months?"" Honestly if the issues are not a huge detriment to you, I would try to stick it out. The gas leak situation is concerning... So maybe if that happens again I would bring it up with the bosses but since it is all resolved now, I don't see how bringing it up to them at this point would be productive.I think at this point since the gas leak issue has been resolved, OSHA is unlikely to get involved. There are some noise protection requirements that OP could discuss with management if noise is really loud but I don't think OSHA is going to do much if the issues are not on-going. At this point the gas leak situation is hearsay. 

If OP feels genuinely unsafe, it may be more worthwhile to quit and THEN report to avoid retaliation. Honestly any time I've heard of people contacting OSHA with problems, nothing gets actually done about it unless someone ends up in the hospital...","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Antique_Ad_8800,"I personally went to St. George’s University. I definitely would’ve failed out of Ross since there’s little to no breaks during the semesters. I really needed the winter breaks and summer breaks. I loved Grenada as an island too. Bringing your animal to Grenada isn’t as bad. If it’s a cat or small dog, they can be in the main plane with you infront of your seat. If they’re larger, they’ll need to be chartered. There’s no quarantine for them. I lived in an apartment for $700 a month then rented a car $350 a month. I could’ve lived closer for a little more, but I liked having my own car there. There was a pet store on island too, but most students got their food from Hill’s shipment. There are many restaurants, bowling, hiking, scuba diving, sea turtles, and a lot of cool things to do. Many island tours and boat rides with friends and peers. I went on so many boats, and there was always alcohol included. There are many bars as well. 
Anywhere you go, what you get what you put in. There’s a lot of exploring to do on both islands. 
I’ve met Ross students, and both island students know a lot more than many students I’ve been in clinics with.

chompomonim,"This is a very good catch and a problem we discussed a lot internally during the last half a year.  


Mysterium always wanted to have hundreds of thousands exit nodes. In such case, banning all of them is not that easy, because new ones will always appear in the network. So if corporations would try to ban Mysterium network they would also ban own users. That's why mysterium’s residential nodes are already being used by 5 centralised VPNs as well as in two dVPN applications.  


To acquire hundreds of thousands exit nodes we’re working on “dual-mode” solution, when Mysterium desktop app users could click a button and start providing Mysterium services in the same time. All they’ll  earn will be toppet into their account balance so technically they will have “free VPN credits” for own usage.  


However governments already proved that they can afford to ban even millions of foreighn residential IP addresses, so entering into the Mysterium network from those censorship heavy countries may be complicated.  


Vlad, our lead protocol architect already created a few improvement proposals on how to approach this problem in a good way. This is quite a big part of Mysterium 2.0 engineering innovation. In general there are two main approaches to this solution.  


1. Don’t allow to fetch all the IP addresses. It should be both expensive and even not possible to do from similar IP range. This would allow bots (both corporations and governments) to fetch only part of a network's IPs and pay for that in the same time.
2. Introduce censorship resistance component into network which would serve as entrance proxy into network. So even if exit nodes would be banned by ISP, this “censorship resistance component” would allow people to join network and then jump into one of exit nodes.In 2017 Mysterium raised 14 million CHF. The important thing is not to denominate in ETH. In fact, we’ve already spent more than the total amount raised.

Thanks to proper finance management, we have enough funds for the next 3-5 years of active Mysterium Network development.  


In terms of Mysterium’s MYST treasury, we own around 25% of MYST total supply. It's not being refinanced or sold, but will be used solely as a project resource. To get more granular, 10% is for the protocol MYST treasury, which is used for things such as providing liquidity and Hermes Protocol staking. 15% is allocated for the next 5-7 years as a long-term company resource and team incentive for maintaining and building the ecosystem.

We have a long journey ahead with Mysterium 2.0, so we have made sure that the company is set up for the long-term.There are a few actions we have done and will be continuing working on.

1. MysteriumVPN already has crypto top-up support (you can use BTC, ETH, LTC, DAI, USDT or DOGE) which is good for crypto community.
2. Mainnet version of the desktop app (and mobile app shortly) will have added credit card support, so users can top up via USD, EUR etc. In a few days after mainnet launch we have already seen a 7x increase in top-ups! and believe that the android app further increase this growth.
3. Mysterium is a permission less platform, which means that anyone can build on top of it. Portals VPN started doing that more than a year ago, they have a subscription model and fiat support as well as a minimalistic user interface.  

4. In the recent months we started getting additional requests from various places on the planet about willingness to create White labeled VPNs on top of Mysterium (in general using our open source apps with their branding and marketing). We’re totally fine with that and will assist as much as we can to project who’re building on top of Mysterium Network.What is important to mention, that even when users are paying with USD, their money are automatically converted into MYST (via our integration with a few exchanges) under the hood. So in the app they’re still spending “MYST credits”It is already implemented in Android app and soon will be added into desktop version as well.MITM attack is only possible when non encrypted protocol is being used (e.g. http instead of https, pop3/imap without SSL, skype and icq instead of telegram or  signal). So we strongly advice everyone to use only encrypted protocols so your browser and messaging apps will protect you from any kind of MITM attempts.  


In addition to that we're thinking to add config option in client side so traffic to unencrypted protocols (such as http) would not work at all.First of all node runners will be able to start with as low as 10MYST stake. Later their node will auto rent more more MYST from delegation pool once it will earn 0.10 DAI (if renting price will be in acceptable range).

The default rate of **1 MYST = 0.01 DAI/day** could be change later by **Mysterium DAO** which will be introduces as part of Tokenomics 2.0.We're looking at various of decentralised DNS solutions. ENS is one of them. Adding a good solution and alternative to centralised DNS is part of Mysterium 2.0 vision.Quality is constructed out of 3 different components: connection speed, ping round trip time and successful connection ratio. Also it is worth to mention that same node may have different quality parameters for users in different countries. E.g. Node from Brazil will have top quality for users from Argentina, but only medium for Russians.Fighting government censorship (including the Chinese Great Firewall) is not an easy task. Simple decentralisation doesn't help here. That is why even decentralised Web3 components such as IPFS are practically unusable in China (see [https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/424](https://github.com/ipfs/notes/issues/424)) and people are suggesting to use VPNs and Proxies to start using IPFS.  


Building tools to fight censorship is part of our Mysterium 2.0 vision. This is a cat and mouse game and to be on the winning side you need great tooling and a few backup solutions. We are already doing various research on that topic as part of Mysterium improvement proposals (MIPs). I hope that in 2022, not only our own dVPN solution will become much more stable in China, but we’ll be able to provide tooling for 3rd party projects.  


Once again, unfortunately simple decentralisation (e.g. use of DHT) is not a solution for this problem, more complex and sophisticated solutions are needed (especially for open projects and networks). While you connect to web3 infrastructure you’re free to do whatever you want, but you still need to find a good way to get connected.There are already more that 120Tb monthly traffic going via ""whitelisted"" nodes. This is around 10-15% of whole network traffic. However only a few regions are interesting to whitelisted B2B partners (such as US, UK, AU, CA, IN, JP, HK) so if you're node is not in that regions then there will be not that much traffic.   


The good news is that our partners at Lavafy sees a good interest 10 more regions among their clients so even more nodes and more demand for whitelisted traffic is coming in near future.  


Also speed performance is very important for B2B partners, so it is advices to have good internet connection and have no limits of throughput.Mysterium exit node uses modular service architecture. This allows us to have multiple services. We already support OpenVPN and Wireguard.   


Now, when mainnet release is done we're going to concentrate on some additional service support. SOCKS5 proxy is among them on our backlog.We expect many exit nodes joining mainnet, but we’re also working hard on having even more b2c consumers and b2b partners starting using services the’re providing.  


There are a number of exit nodes who are definitely earning more than power and internet cost. Also Mysterium doesn’t require specialised hardware, so even if you buy a $70 worth Raspberry Pi dedicated to Mysterium, this will not be a significant investment compared to potential earnings.  


Please check top performing nodes here:[https://my.mysterium.network/leaderboard](https://my.mysterium.network/leaderboard)I already answered about remaining funds in another question: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/comment/hlwu0il/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/comment/hlwu0il/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

DAO decision making will be part of Mysterium 2.0 and Tokenomics 2.0. E.g. DAO will decide on staking rate required or which payment token should be used in the network.MYSTT is a test token on Ethereum goerli testnet and Polygon Mumbai testnet. It was used in Mysterium's testnet. MYSTT is not a tradable token but rather a tool which helped us to test and debug our payments solution before going to mainnet.

Your old rewards stays in testnet. If you are eligible for bounty payout in upcoming payout in beginning of December, you'll get your bounty in the same way as it was done during whole year.

There will be no testnet bounty anymore starting from December 2021.I'd like clarify a little timeline behind tokenomics 2.0 and node staking.   
Tokenomics 2.0 staking (when node have to stake own or borrowed MYST to receive traffic) will be introduced only in end of Q1 2022. All current calculations of 1 MYST stake to receive $0.01 DAI is just preview of what is comming rather than something node runners will need to do right after mainnet launch.  
In upcoming Mainnet release, new nodes will have to stake some small amount of MYST (between 0.1MYST and 10MYST) to proof skin in the game and cover registration tx fee (pay for Polygon gas). This stake will work differently than one described in Tokenomics 2.0.  


**Tokenomics 1.0 staking:**

* proofs that node is puting skin in the game and is not just random bot sending proposals
* will guarantee that hermes is always ready to settle (important for those who'd like to do very rare settlements and withdrawals --> saving blockchain tx fees) 
* will increase node's changes being higher in smart (re)connect selection --> more likely to get sessions  


*NOTE: Testnet3 nodes migrated into mainnet will be not required to stake and will be registered for free (Mysterium team will cover blockchain fees required for node registration)*I will answer you some ETA in a month ;)We investigated possibility to create iOS app using our current node implementation and unfortunately due to some iOS limitations this is harder that we thought.

Please check top performing nodes here:[https://my.mysterium.network/leaderboard](https://my.mysterium.network/leaderboard) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlwz83r/  I already answered about remaining funds in another question: [https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/comment/hlwu0il/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/comment/hlwu0il/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

DAO decision making will be part of Mysterium 2.0 and Tokenomics 2.0. E.g. DAO will decide on staking rate required or which payment token should be used in the network. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlx47hy/  MYSTT is a test token on Ethereum goerli testnet and Polygon Mumbai testnet. It was used in Mysterium's testnet. MYSTT is not a tradable token but rather a tool which helped us to test and debug our payments solution before going to mainnet.

Your old rewards stays in testnet. If you are eligible for bounty payout in upcoming payout in beginning of December, you'll get your bounty in the same way as it was done during whole year.

There will be no testnet bounty anymore starting from December 2021. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/r16n49/ama_hey_crypto_reddit_savannah_lee_and_jaro/hlx4rfa/  I'd like clarify a little timeline behind tokenomics 2.0 and node staking.   
Tokenomics 2.0 staking (when node have to stake own or borrowed MYST to receive traffic) will be introduced only in end of Q1 2022. All current calculations of 1 MYST stake to receive $0.01 DAI is just preview of what is comming rather than something node runners will need to do right after mainnet launch.  
In upcoming Mainnet release, new nodes will have to stake some small amount of MYST (between 0.1MYST and 10MYST) to proof skin in the game and cover registration tx fee (pay for Polygon gas). This stake will work differently than one described in Tokenomics 2.0.  


**Tokenomics 1.0 staking:**

* proofs that node is puting skin in the game and is not just random bot sending proposals
* will guarantee that hermes is always ready to settle (important for those who'd like to do very rare settlements and withdrawals --> saving blockchain tx fees) 
* will increase node's changes being higher in smart (re)connect selection --> more likely to get sessions  


*NOTE: Testnet3 nodes migrated into mainnet will be not required to stake and will be registered for free (Mysterium team will cover blockchain fees required for node registration)* ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/qmowdk/mainnet_launch/hjqmppr/  I will answer you some ETA in a month ;) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/lir863/does_anyone_know_when_there_will_be_an_ios_app/gnj4vbb/  We investigated possibility to create iOS app using our current node implementation and unfortunately due to some iOS limitations this is harder that we thought.

There will be also possibility to choose where to withdraw, into Polygon or to Ethereum.

Another less visible difference is that now network will be using Polygon's mainnet, so network users (a.k.a. **consumers**) **will use MYST in their app wallets for payments**. This is effectively making MYST token a fuel of Mysterium Network. There will be no free tokens during initial app launch for new users. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/qwqzms/changes_with_mainnet_launch/hlbbte0/  Yes, after certain version upgrade. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/nbej3k/you_already_know_whats_coming_up_for_mysterium/gy0zjr2/  Thank you for sharing.   


A month ago it was still working. Most probably they started banning our node discovery service. So if you could fetch list of nodes, then it would connect to selected node without your VPN.  


We're looking on various ways how to make our discovery much harder to ban. There are various solutions we plan to do in the future. China is definitely important market and being available there is hight our roadmap. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ivr082/china_does_not_work_for_me_in_china_but_orchid/g6e8k82/  It is recommended to have at least 1Gb of RAM. It is possible to run mysterium node on 512 Mb RAM hardware, however default install script or RPi image may not work. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ejzkxv/get_this_error_on_raspberry_pi_model_b_so_doesnt/fg820v6/  Please look at QuickSwap trading option. There is MYST/USDC pool and Polygon's tx fee is super tiny. The only problem is Polygon bridge price (which I believe is still less that uniswap fees).   


Also if you have account at Bitmax exchange, you can move USDC from there to Polygon directly with minimal fees.

During your interview include your aspirations to become a vet, and how grateful you are to have the opportunity to meet with your interviewers since this a great step to work towards your future career. be confident with everything you say. ask questions! “is the schedule fixed or does it rotate?” “is their room for growth?

Another point: Bittrex is full of scam coins which barely have a team (there a tons to name), so the decision of delisting a coin which is around for much time and has a solid project/product/team is not justified. We should spam or kindly ask Bittrex to review their rating about the MYST project. Write an e-mail to support or write in their reddit or twitter.

chaotictiktaalik,"Congrats on your new position! :)

**Some things that helped me to memorize as a new vet assistant:** 

• Where on the animal the vaccine is administered and at what age (does it have a booster, how many years is it good for, are there choices for the owner to make, etc.). The hardest appointments as a new vet assistant are new clients/pets with records, so knowing what to look for can speed up the process. 


• The purpose of each vaccine- owners will ask. Know which vaccines are considered core vaccines at your clinic (typically rabies and distemper) and which are more lifestyle dependent (like bordetella, lepto).

• All of the flea, tick, and heartworm medications. Different practices will carry different things, but having some knowledge of what is covered by Bravecto, Simparica Trio, Heartgard, and Nexgard is a good start.

**More practical things to make sure you’re familiar with:**

• Know how to write/interpret a check and count change efficiently

• Know how to address mail (sometimes practices will send welcome/sympathy cards to owners)

• Know the conversion between kilos and pounds (2.2 pounds/kilo)

• Know normal heart rate ranges for animals of different sizesHere’s my list of essentials that are nice to have whether you’re a vet assistant, tech, or veterinarian: 

1. A nice pack of ballpoint pens. Having lots of extra pens is nice, I often find myself losing them and having to borrow crappy ones from the office. A small thing that can make your life a lot easier. 

2. An insulated water bottle/coffee mug. We often work long shifts and spend a significant portion of the day talking to clients, so beverages are a must. To go along with this, veterinary-related stickers would be cute. 

3. A small notepad that could fit in a pocket. I often have to jot down notes quickly while on the phone. 

4. A small bag to carry belongings to/from work. Big enough for a phone, pens, maybe a backup pair of scrubs/lab coat in case you get peed on, car keys, and a water bottle. 

5. A small (human) first aid kit. Bites and scratches are bound to happen, and human bandages are often overlooked.My biggest piece of advice would be to keep on applying to kennel technician and veterinary assistant jobs. Many kennel technicians go in with minimal experience and some places will be willing to train veterinary assistants on the job as well. It’s all about finding the right fit at the right time. 

Put together a resume and cover letter that explain your education and skills thus far so that it’s at the ready when job openings are posted. Focus on your strengths and how you could contribute to the practice in absence of experience. Remember, strong communication skills, responsibility, and work ethic are huge assets that they often cannot teach. If you have these skills, they may see a huge benefit in training you. 

It can also be super helpful to carve out some larger blocks of time in your class schedule for potential work hours. Jobs at veterinary practices are usually scheduled in 4+ hour shifts (primarily on week days), so they can be tricky to juggle with a student schedule.Take a deep breath. Remember that what will happen will happen, and that even if you don’t get the job, interview experience is so helpful and you’ll do even better next time. Here are some of the questions I was asked:

**Most important one**: what is your availability? 

• What experience do you have?

• Did you grow up with pets at home?

• What are your strengths and weaknesses? As others have mentioned, prepare 3 of each. 

• How do you typically respond to conflict?

• If you are in school, what year are you? This is important because practices like to know how long you could potentially work for them

Practice answering these types of questions so they don’t catch you off guard in the interview. Good luck! You’re going to do great OP :)As an undergrad, laboratory positions will expect you to be inexperienced. If there is a specific subject that you feel passionate about and have covered in your coursework thus far (such as microbiology, immunology, chemistry, reproduction), consider reaching out to professors in those fields/labs. 

Here’s a rough example email: 

“Dear Dr. —-

I am a — year undergraduate student studying (major) hoping to go on to vet school. I am looking for a laboratory position in order to gain experience. When doing research into the different professors who run campus laboratories, your lab stuck out to me because you have a background in —- and —-, which interest me greatly. I have taken classes in — and —, and would love to learn more. Let me know if you think that I could be an asset to your lab and I would love to meet with you if you have any questions. You can contact me at (school email) or (other). 

Thanks, 
(Full name)I’m not in the NYC area but I know how hard it is to find a job opportunity in the veterinary field that is short-term. Have you considered shadowing veterinarians? This can be a great way to get to know them and if you build a relationship with them, they might be more accommodating of your student schedule. 

I took summer courses during my sophomore year to free up time for an assistant job during my junior and senior year, which worked well for me to gain as much experience as possible. If this is feasible for you, I would recommend a part time job at a vet clinic during your undergrad schooling. I know it can be super overwhelming but vet schools ask for a lot, so the juggling is sometimes necessary to fit everything in.You can absolutely be a vet assistant or kennel attendant without a degree. There are some distinctions between a vet assistant job and a kennel attendant job, although they will vary by location. 

Typically, the duties of a kennel attendant include taking care of boarding animals (feeding, giving water, changing blankets), cleaning/disinfecting cages, sweeping/mopping the practice, and doing laundry. This job especially appeals to those who aren’t as eager about dealing with clients directly. 

A vet assistant, on the other hand, is often responsible for checking in clients and taking the patient’s vitals, then conveying relevant information to the veterinarian. They also assist with holding animals and drawing up vaccines. If you have great interpersonal skills and somewhat of an interest in medicine, this is the job for you.

As for the money… there’s a reason why these jobs are often used as a stepping stone before vet/tech school. You will start out making minimum wage, and I would not consider it a livable long-term salary. That being said, if you love it, do it. Tech school is shorter and more affordable than vet school, so maybe that is something you’d like to explore in the future. Certified technicians are like gold in vet clinics so with two years of schooling, you’d be pretty much assured a job. You’d also make quite a bit more than an assistant/attendant.Yes! Starting off as a kennel attendant is a great pathway to reach assistant/technician. The speed at which you can move up depends greatly on the needs of the practice. Lots of vet assistants/techs leave for vet school in the summer months, so that would be a good time to inquire about moving up.Congratulations! I got my first vet assistant job about a month ago :) my biggest piece of advice would be to not beat yourself up about what you don’t know in the beginning. It can be a lot to learn and you’ve got to think quickly at times, but you’ll get the hang of it. Ask lots of questions, don’t be afraid to rely on your coworkers for help, and make sure to log your hours if you’re planning on applying to vet school. 

This is completely optional, but I also found it helpful to spend some time learning about different vaccinations & medications (like flea prevention brands) outside of work time. I studied the costs, what ages they are given at, and where/how they are administered. I felt like it took a little bit of pressure off of me to become familiar with the different treatments when I wasn’t on the spot.How’s it going so far OP?Aww yay! I’m so glad to hear it :) getting to the part where you finally get comfortable is so rewardingThe best thing that you can do as a student considering pre-vet is to shadow as much as you can. There’s a reason why vet schools require so many experience hours - you’ll learn a ton and it will answer the question of whether you’ll be happy in the field or not. 

I will caution you against allowing this singular opportunity to decide whether you pursue vet school or not. Different clinics have completely different philosophies, and you may be able to see yourself at one and not another. I’ve shadowed at 5 different clinics and my experiences have varied greatly. Some vets are super welcoming to shadows while others are more reserved. Don’t let one negative experience discourage you. I passed out during my first time shadowing, thought the dream was over for me, and now I’m a vet assistant working on my vet school application. 

It’s also important to remember that you will be successful no matter what path you end up on. If you don’t end up enjoying vet med, that doesn’t make you a failure. The most important thing is that you choose a career you’ll enjoy.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment was written by a medical doctor, as it discusses surgical techniques and anatomy related to human",Medical Doctor

cheesefeast,"What a horrible take. In real life you can take 10 minutes to consider your options. Or you can tell the owner hey- this is out of the ordinary, let me go reference some resources. Or I do have other patients to see, I will continue to work with you on between getting these other pets out of here. People generally understand when they have a sick pet that you might not get a diagnosis upon exam only. You can also have pets drop off. You can also call the next day after discussion with your mentor, etc with a plan moving forward. You really think that the NAVLE is questions about calculating epinephrine and that’s what they can’t pass? Just make an emergency drug sheet and you’ll never have to calculate that on the spot ever again- and if you don’t, you should be using a drug manual to be sure your dose is correct. But when you see a chicken for the first time in 5 years with pox marks on its comb- you can go look that up. NAVLE is full of questions that not everyone will remain brushed up on- that makes it challenging. There’s so much info about stuff that feels very irrelevant to someone who is not going to practice medicine on reptiles, avian species, swine, ruminants, horses, and small animal AND practice public health. Need to look something up? You can do that. Need to call the reference lab and discuss the case with the internist? You can do that. Unless it emergency stabilization of a patient, there is time to make accommodations for themselves. If you really can’t occasionally take 10 minutes to be sure the treatment plan you’re choosing for this animal makes sense, especially right out of school RUN FROM THAT JOB into a job with better mentorship. And if your mentor says things like this ^ OP? Run..

Ps- go look at this guys comment history for a laugh- he’s not even a practicing vet in the “real world”, he’s a freaking trolling student trying to get everyone out of the profession.

May our paths never cross!Clients and colleagues are not going to like working with you once you get to the real world if you keep this nasty uncooperative and holier than thou attitude.Definitely a good time to talk to your therapist! I wish I had sooner as a new grad. Sounds like you’re already considering how you could improve your approach to both to change your comfort level next time, but neither are worth beating yourself up over.

Medical_Watch1569,"Real shit right here. A bitch is tired.lol a clinic like this is what made me change from small animal work to research. Get out while you still can before it taints your relationship with patient treatments forever like it did me. Now I’d rather be around my research mice all day than see patients and deal with vets/techs/management.I got so lucky. Summer program for research that my school offered and my whole world changed, not only did my passion for vet school come back but my will to make a difference. Finally feel like I found my calling. I love what I do, no regrets even though it ended up adding more schooling onto an already tedious degree path. 

If you ever wanted, a lot of animal research places take unlicensed technicians as staffing is always a problem. You can learn so much and work your way up usually (career changes suck though, I know). Otherwise, I know some medical technician certifications are 100% online or minimally in person for a reasonable price, and that’s a great in for working AR. If you ever get in the position for it, I say go for it. It’s never too late to follow a dream or interest until you’re dead, that’s what I always say!Way to go you!! Crazy how one small opportunity can open a whole new world of opportunities and passion for a subject you didn’t know you loved.Do the best you can but do NOT kill yourself trying to be top of your class, or by doing too many outside activities related to school. Always have hobbies and interests outside of school you can indulge in as an escape.The good ol forgetting, my favorite.Yup we do them on a case by case basis (determined by the vet as we see fit) and as a result haven’t seen a hematoma in what feels like years now.","Other.

PresentationFew2014,"I would recommend doing some research about roles involving animal advocacy before jumping straight onto the vet med train. Like there are so many opportunities in shelter/rescue management, outreach programs wildlife facilities and nature parks, etc. To get through a vet med program of any kind, you have to truly have a passion for the medicine part. 

I guess what kind of advocating are you wanting to do? And how would a dvm or rvt help that mission?So that’s admirable, and it’s great to have dreams and I don’t want to dampen those….but I want you to really, really look into the realities of getting into this field. How are you going to pay for vet school? Most people take out loans. How are you going to pay those off? What are you going to do for income if you’re wanting to offer free services/low cost services? Which, btw, low cost doesn’t actually mean cheaper…it just means someone else is subsidizing the cost of care. Those programs don’t pay vets a lot and it’s really hard to keep up with student loans on that type of salary.Yes, this! And also employee tuition benefits are often different for undergraduate vs professional programs. My husband works for the university where I go to vet school. Spouses get 50% off tuition, but it's 50% off the undergrad rate, which is only $6k per semester and vet school here is $20k per semester.I think that's what you need to decide then. Veterinary medicine isn't the only field that works with animals, but it has some unique challenges compared to others. You need to decide what part of working with animals you enjoy. If you don't actually enjoy medicine, the working with animals part is not going to be enough to make this a fulfilling career for you.Does the school your mom works at also have a vet school? There are only 30ish in the country. 

Also, even if there is a vet school at the college your mom works at, you'll need to check with her that the benefits are still covered the same way. Undergrad tuition and professional school tuition are different. 

Beyond that, you're a sophomore in high school. So you're 5-6+ years from even applying to vet school, 10ish years from potentially graduating. What is your plan if your mom no longer works for the school, if she gets laid off or finds another opportunity?In the US we have veterinary assistants and veterinary technicians. Vet techs would be the vet nurse equivalent because they have similar educational requirements to human nurses. You usually don't need previous experience to be a vet assistant though.Did you complete 80% of VetPrep before you took the NAVLE? I think they'll extend your subscription for free if you completed 80% and didn't pass. They have some sort of 'guarantee'Look up the ICVA Species and Diagnosis list. It's basically a list of all the conditions they might test on (though they claim it might not be totally comprehensive, it's the closest that we have to it). Use it as a guide for things you may need to review. 

But also just remember how much of the NAVLE is luck! Sometimes the question set just doesn't align with your strengths. One of my questions was literally trivia that I had learned the day before, and I'd bet others had similar experiences. Don't put too much stock into how many times you take the NAVLE.I just signed a contract as a new grad with CareVet, they manage \~200 practices mostly in the Midwest. One of their practices, I actually used to work for before it was sold to CareVet. I've kept in touch with a lot of those people and they really seem to enjoy it. They're pretty transparent about wages, benefits, etc.

[https://www.carevethealth.com/](https://www.carevethealth.com/)She’s being unreasonable. You’re doing great! I haven’t even been able to get my spays under an hour yet (although I’ve only done a handful of each).What do you mean by abstract? The NAVLE is a mile wide and an inch deep. The lectures and power pages are designed to be a concise way for you to review the most pertinent material. If they don’t work for you though, maybe supplement with your notes. 

I found it most helpful to review material for some time and then do some practice questions. I recommend at least one 60 question practice exam/week to get you used to the length of the blocks on the NAVLE and gauge your progress. I was getting like 40% correct when I first started, but my last one was like 87%. And you only need like a 55% to pass the NAVLE. 

Also look into the ICVA practice exams. There are 3 in English, one of which has answers to it that you can review. They cost money, but I think they were worth it to get a better idea of what the NAVLE questions are like (they aren’t like VetPrep at all) and feel more confident with my predicted scores.I think it’s worth it to try to be more competitive in Canada. I get wanting to get in school and get it over with since you’re a little older than your classmates, but it’d be a much better investment in yourself to not go into that much debt. I also started vet school a little later, I’m 30 and getting ready to graduate in May. But I’m so glad it took me 3 years to get into my instate. I had more time to gain experience and boost my GPA, and I’m not in nearly as much debt as my out of state classmates. Still a lot, but a lot less.I have a friend who started out as an assistant, then took on inventory management, became the practice manager before it was bought out by corporate, and now she's like some sort of regional manager for the corporation. I don't remember what her exact title is now, but it is possible.Unfortunately a non-competitive GPA can really tank your chances regardless of how many hours you have. I also had a lot of vet hours but a low GPA and it took me 3 years to get in while specifically tailoring my application to my in-state (my school's acceptance rate is \~50% for instate students, so my best odds).

One thing that really helped me improve my GPA was taking online veterinary technician courses with Penn Foster. It was the cheapest option per credit hour, I was able to work at my own pace, and I was learning information that would help me in the field regardless if I got into vet school or I finished the program and became a licensed technician. I would also recommend talking to your workplace because they might be willing to pay for some of your schooling to become licensed, especially if you anticipate taking a few years to get in to vet school.In my shelter med rotation in vet school, they had us place so many ligatures that I almost always ended up leaving behind a ""whale tail."" I don't know if I'll use that many when I practice, but as far as I know we never had any complications from leaving that much uterus behind. ORS leading to stump pyometra would be a potential concern later on either way.I strongly recommend doing research into the realities of veterinary school and specifically the wildlife medicine career path before you make any decisions. When you graduate from vet school, you won't have to practice on food animals if you don't want to. However, in your clinical rotations, you won't have a choice. You'll have to do at least one food animal rotation. My school even had a required field trip to observe slaughterhouse operations. Some schools also still do terminal surgeries on pigs as part of the surgery lab, so think about those types of things as you look into schools.

Also wildlife medicine as a field is super hard to get into. So look into that whole process and determine if you could do something else with a dvm if you can't get into that specialty.I should mention too that a common pathway these days for going into wildlife medicine is to do a rotating large animal internship first. Not saying that’s the only way to do it…but there is a lot that you learn from large animals that is applicable in wildlife medicineIf you don't like medicine, then don't work in medicine.

xjestersdeadx,"Just to update. This was ""solved"" by reinstalling MacOs, then using a time machine backup from Feb 6 before I had installed Homebrew! I tried to copy what directories I could think of before that in terms of film projects and photos since I do a lot of editing. About 28 hours later, boom- both work again. I can turn one off, then turn the other on, and vice versa. SOMETHING I did obviously got in the way of that. The only thing I think to do is now I am back to not having Homebrew on my system. I really, really, really.... (LOL) don't want to go through that ordeal again, but if I make any other major changes I will try both VPNS each time so I can note here and warn people. As of now, it looks like something that happened with Homebrew messed up maybe a path the VPN's are looking for? I just don't know. I am already considering getting a mac mini so what I might do is try everything there, put home-brew on it, and see if that was the problem.

It is just frustrating as it was allowing me to switch back and forth for several weeks, then obviously I did something that isn't allowing that to happen.

f4un4,"great advice in this comment section so far! for context i am a ""lead"" veterinary assistant. i essentially got this position by being a jack of all trades at my hospital (we also don't have many CVT's haha, otherwise i am sure there would be a lead technician). don't undervalue things like reception and customer service. learn both the front of house (reception) and back of house (technician) operations. 

honestly it is evident that you are eager to learn-- make sure that your team can also see this same enthusiasm! you are going to do great!  now, not every moment can be a ""teaching moment"", i ask questions as much as i can but i also learned to read the room and know when it was inappropriate for me to ask questions, and rather just help how i can, which frequently means simply restraining the animal and/or monitoring. there is going to be a lot to learn and it will feel like a lot at once, just know that there's definitely a learning curve and you will totally get past it. with each day of experience, you will get better (even if you don't realize!). sure, there were some things i had to go out of my way to study but a lot of what i know came from experience and getting used to the routine of the clinic.

learning your flea and heartworm prevention is huge imo, helping people understand that fleas and heartworms actually can enter gated communities (yup, somebody said that once) and understanding which kind is best for their lifestyle. obviously, follow the guidance of the dr. but frankly techs and assistants have a LOT to do with client education as well, as typically we are the ones who go over patient histories and treatment plans/estimates.

i would also say it is important to learn how to run labs pretty quickly. no one is going to be expecting you to place IV catheters or do blood draws on day one, but to be able to go run things on the machine and/or read the cytology will be super useful. 

one of the few things i had to really study as opposed to learn through experience was the drugs used during surgeries. pre-op/induction drugs vs post-op vs emergency drugs. mainly what you need to know is how what drugs the vet uses will affect your patient, for example some cause bradycardia, some cause them to wake up really hard, etc. this will be important to know if you are monitoring patients, which, not to worry, I don't think they will throw you into!!

anyway, sorry for the yap fest. this is an awesome job and an awesome field. it is hard, don't get me wrong. but you will connect with so many pets and so many people. i am at a point where i have a rapport with pets and their families and it just means the world to me.i am so happy to hear that your cat made it <3
any gesture will mean a lot, im sure. but i agree with those mentioning a hand written card. if you remember the names of those who helped you, include them. we love food of course but a physical reminder that we can keep to remind us that there are people who appreciate us goes a long way.","Veterinarian.

CootEnthusiast,"The matching shirts at IVECCS was such an ick moment for me. It didn't feel professionals at a conference, it felt like they were using their employees to advertise their brand. They all seemed happy enough, but I'm not into that vibe.Anecdotal experience aside, why do you find yourself holding on to Metro? Is it because you worry about the health of the pet, or the flack from a client if you don't prescribe it or because, gasp, the diarrhea is still happening after day 2? Something else? I'll point out that you didn't really come prepared to argue your stance FOR metro in your meeting, moreso you just brought evidence to shift the spotlight onto others. Certainly Prazosin is something that should be avoided, so your evidence is not wrong, but avoiding talking about your choices doesn't necessarily help in your decision making.

I've found I rarely have a reason to prescribe it anymore, and personally had a very easy time moving away from it. Sure, those really sick AHDS dogs I hospitalized at my ER could be a reason, but the watery to soft brown diarrhea with negative giardia/fecal dogs who are otherwise well, or the known dietary indiscretion cases, definitely don't need it. Nothing about an antibiotic is going to fix a dog who ate a dead bird faster than time, and maybe some extra fiber.

It's really good you're doing self reflection like this. You're not a dinosaur, you're just trying your best to find reasoning for how to make your medical decisions.

Also agreed, Gabapentin really grinds my gears and I wish we had more options for dogs.Cats at least have Buprenorphine as a non-NSAID method of efficacious pain control to be sent home with. Dogs who can't have an nsaids or galliprant are stuck with Gabapentin or Tylenol, of which neither are proven to be significantly helpfulDo they, though? We have no science to tell us Metro is what they need to fix hematochezia except in cases of ""infection"", which we never really have evidence of. We can counter with anecdotes all day - in my experience it's pets who have been on only a couple days of treatment, so they need more time anyway, and the hematochezia comes and goes in about 48 hours regardless of what we give them, typically just a result of colitis. Certainly the ones who are still eating/drinking/not vomiting I don't dispense it right off the bat. The super sick ones who are hospitalized, sure I'll consider it, but even then I'm sure if that's what's doing the fixing. I hope they continue to dog deeper into the research so help shed light on these types of cases!I suppose what I mean is the inconsistency at which these drugs are used, or even stocked at many clinics. At my ER, my biggest gripe is the post-op FBs with pissed guts who aren't in a place yet to have NSIADs (diarrhea ongoing and what not) - they have Nocita on board when we have it in stock, but we inconsistently use Gaba vs T+C as their oral pain med between doctors, and you're right T+C is at least better, but many doctors reach for the Gaba because its more familiar to them despite the studies. Old dogs with elevated liver enzymes and acute on chronic pain can be a bit of a headache in a similar way. This extends to the primary clinics we work with - many are very small and literally only have Carprofen/Galliprant and Gabapentin in stock for dogs, most at least have oral bup or Zorbium to dispense to cats, so when a dog can't get an nsaid with them, they get the leas effective regular Tylenol or Gabapentin.

I didn't mean to sound like it was some sort of dramatic rate limiting factor in practice, most cases it all works out fine, but Gabapentin is becoming the next tramadol in that some clinics  reach for it readily or only have that as another option because its cheap, easy, and has minimal side effects, without regard to trying to have other options available knowing its pain control effects are ""good enough"" to them anecdotally.

Hope that vent makes sense, lol.Long since discovered to be not efficacious for pain. We do not even stock it at our clinic anymoreAh, I see. You're lucky! It's an every day occurrence at my place. Owners of day 1 diarrhea pets will stroll through the door without a second thought even when we tell them it's not an emergency...womp wompDavis is arguably the hardest US school to get into - they are the top vet school and primarily fill their seats with instate students, so there is a ton of competition in the thousands of out of state applicants for the few seats they do have for out of state.

SnooOranges4,I would HIGHLY recommend working as a tech or veterinary assistant for at least a year before applying to vet school. It's obviously not exactly the same as working as the vet but you'll learn a lot about the field and have a much better idea of whether you would actually want to stay in it. I've been a tech for 3 years now. I applied to vet school this year and got rejected from all of them. And that's with all of my experience (gp and er) and excellent grades and extra curriculars. I'm going to apply again and hope for the best. But honestly if I don't get in this second time applying I don't know if I'll try again.

PublicWarning101,"It's brilliant! It depends on the company that you go with or the practice that you go for I guess.. I won't name the company that I work for as I don't know if it would be a good idea for me. 

What I will say though, as this is my suspicion, the bigger the company the better the professional/career benefits(like CPD - Continuous Professional Development - with costs covered by the company), but the worse work life balance(but this depends on the area and people(which itself, people is a hugely varying factor))

I would say that the company I work for is fairly big. They provide great CPD sessions and I am lucky enough to have chosen an area where the teams that I work with are great and quite multi cultural and understanding, whilst the people/customers are minimally racist and sexist(although be prepared to see that every so often regardless.. people are dumb af) so I am very happy with my choice to have come to the UK on a Graduate Scheme a few years back. The company helped me develop a lot and I feel that I have become a great surgeon because of all their support

BUT.. I had colleagues in London that were going through hell while in the grad program because of the workload dumped on them.. also the cost of living was and still is huge compared to other areas of the country, whilst their salary was the same as mine. So unless you definitely want to go to London for some specific reason, I would just avoid that area altogether.SureI would probably bring up the legality of it. Look into how legal it is to film customers in this way without them knowing. If there is a legal issue I would probably bring that up rather than my being uncomfortable being recorded.

From a professional perspective, I couldn't say it's something completely fair nor something completely wrong.. I'd say there are a couple of factors at play here. 

If your boss is a piece of shit, with a known track record of picking on everything, sanctioning every tiny detail and not allowing any mistakes(known or unknown to the customer), well then, this approach is just despicable, not because (s)he is recording, but because (s)he is basically saying ""I will see you, I will find your every mistake and hold you up to it""

On the other hand, if your boss is a great person, that looks to teach you, to mentor you, to be by your side and guide you into your career, then this is potentially a good approach. I'm saying that due to an experience I heard of a new doctor was being mentored/shadowed by the lead vet and because of that, the customer wasn't even considering the new grad. They had to resort to hiding behind a door so that they wouldn't interfere with the consults but still hear what was being said. That was to provide confidence to the new grad(so they wouldn't feel completely alone) as well as step in if something was completely wrong. 

I suspect that having recordings of consults can potentially help in cases like these, but again, it depends, so I hope these perspectives help.

I found that making quick reference guides helps a lot for brain stress (since working memory is rough), and it can take a bit to find a clinic that's a good, solid fit.

Easy-Echidna-8120,"Just guessing, but the value of myst has been increasing over the last week. In order to maintain a constant price per gb against a currency (USD as an example) the price would vary. Also the price per gb varies based on the number of nodes on your country, this is stated in the documentation if I remember clearly. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10beqk6/low_income/j4fak1t/  Came across this thread while trying to debug my issue. It’s not exactly the same but does have some similarities.

My setup is similar to Mike. Just that I’m running mysterium node in a docker container and I’m only running 1 node.
I have two ISP in my home lab and therefore two IP’s. In my case however one of the IP’s act as a backup like in the case my primary connection fails. Hence the backup line has limited bandwidth and data limits.

The problem I’m having is myst runs fine and establishes connections on my backup connection but does not work on my primary connection.

On mystnodes.com it appears to be online but if I look into the logs I notice than when a client is trying to establish a connection I get errors saying “too few connections established” and this is a repeated cycle.
My understanding of this (and I could be wrong) clients are trying to establish a connection but it fails.

At this point when I switch over to be backup connection and restart the container in a few minutes I see connections establish successfully on the nodeUI

I tried contacting support but they are unable to understand my problem. They keep asking me to forward ports. Which makes no sense because the network setup works perfectly fine with my backup connection. 

Is there a possibility my primary ISP is blocking something that myst needs to function ? 

Any pointers would be really appreciated. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1035ypu/connection_failed/j3d52cm/  Thanks for the response, appreciate it.

I’m running proxmox, with a virtual Ubuntu server. Docker runs within this virtual machine and my node is running as a container.

I have not made a a specific network configurations except that my node can communicate outside it’s isolated docker network I.e it can communicate with the host machines network. Also there is no DMZ setup for this server.

To elaborate on switching between my primary and backup network. There are no changes made on the proxmox, docker or the node side.
I have a multi-WAN router which allows me to set one IP as my primary and one as my secondary.

On the router I switch between thr primary and secondary after which I restart the container. This is where on mystnodes I can see the IP change showing me myst is now using the connection I set as primary.

In the case of one of my connections there are no client connections that establish when I look into the container  logs I can see clients trying to establish a connection but there are errors here is a small excerpt of the error that caught my attention

WRN ../../nat/traversal/pinger.go:138              > One of the pings has error error=""ping receiver error: context deadline exceeded""

WRN ../../nat/traversal/pinger.go:138              > One of the pings has error error=""ping receiver error: context deadline exceeded""

At this point if I switch to my backup IP with a similar process described above. Connections begin to establish

In summary, the only change im technically making is the IP or in essence the ISP. Which is leading me to think one of the ISP’s is blocking something that myst needs to establish a connection successfully. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1035ypu/connection_failed/j3frmbp/","Other.

Desperate-Car6229,"The way that I feel like we have to confirm names and stuff but in real life I think I’ve rarely called and ask a client their name or how they would prefer to be called 😭 and these classes seem so pointless especially if you’ve worked up front like as a CSR, there are times I find them helpful but in most cases the way they talk is nowhere NEAR realistic. I much more enjoy client simulated encounters where I actually feel like I’m talking to clients and finding my own grooveI don’t support the private schools but I will say the public schools should be supported OR there should be more sponsored seats for students from states that don’t have schools to go to other programs. The problem with that is that vet schools with teaching hospitals are already struggling to teach the students they have from what I hear. Also I think there’s a lot to consider too- students from these states opening new schools might have to be choosing to either take a chance on a school that is new/doesn’t have a teaching hospital or take on an extra 80k of debt just to go to get the same degree from another school that is considered “superior” because it has a teaching hospital? I think that is a bit of a difficult thing to navigate because also that’s so much money. For the private schools this isn’t really an issue but there are many new state sponsored schools opening and these will allow students to pay in state tuition and reducing their debtUniversity of Arizona is a three year program and so while the year seems just as expensive it is still comparable to other public universities per semester, and has less interest accruing because it’s three years as well just fyi- it is also in state vs out of state and oos can qualify for IS after a year. It is also public like Texas Tech and has state fundingWhich is luckily not quite accurate! That’s factoring living costs which are budgeted way higher depending on what you do lifestyle wise. For example, they budgeted around 1,600 a month or so for just rent- which is much less than I pay splitting with a roommate and others live in lower cost apartments. That’s why looking at JUST tuition it is comparable to other schools. Not to say that I support not having a teaching hospital, I wish we did, and I don’t know why I have to pay an equal amount of tuition my clinical year to literally be at other places- however I’m still saving a significant amount of money- at least 80k- as an AZ resident because of this school which will overall lower my debt and allow me to have less financial pressure and stress when I graduate. My living costs combined with scholarships that I received mean that my cost is actually much lower, and many of my classmates have at least some form of financial aid. I’m looking at closer to 150k versus going OOS where my next cheapest option has me at about 230k. Of course if you take out full COA then you’re looking at something more pricey, but again living costs aren’t actually as high as they estimated which is why I’m focusing on tuition!Definitely understand that! I think from what I’ve heard there are many different sides to the education for clinical year. I’ve heard stories from students at places with teaching hospitals who describe their clinical year as being treated as a glorified tech for free labor getting to do barely any procedures because of competition with interns and residents. 

On the other hand, I’ve talked to students from my school who during their clinical year have wracked up hundreds of surgeries under their belt, from spays and neuters to dentals, amputations, enunciations, etc… and basically running appointments by themselves, but I’ve also heard students who said they went to rotations where they didn’t get to do much or saw some not as good standard medicine. I think that the variability is probably much crazier and depends on how you plan your clinical year and what site you go to.

So I definitely see the concern and I think both have pros and cons to them!

And it seems like looking at tuition then it’s pretty comparable. I was accepted to Cornell OOS and chose to go to U of A as a resident and when I compared costs it was over 100k more. Not to mention, a three year program means that interest accrues slightly less because you graduate sooner which is a trade off with not having summer breaks . 

Sorry this is so long lolThat’s great! I think the issue is there is a big bias that a teaching hospital is gold standard and that’s the way it’s been for so long, which I do think has lots of benefits but also there’s a lot of cons with it as well. I also hate that our program is getting a bad rep, I’m hoping that as more grads go out and hopefully make a good impression and we hopefully do better on NAVLE it will fix the stigma. I think there needs to be more PUBLIC vet schools to help support students from those states and give them better chances of becoming a vet with less debt, also hopefully putting vets in those higher need areas because they can with a lower debt loadAlso lowkey can I shoot you a pm to ask you some questions about your clinical year 👁️👁️Echoing the above! I had the same thoughts right before I entered vet school (except for wildlife biology) and it’s pretty similar as far as job prospects and internships go. Had the same thoughts- I’m going to shoot for wildlife veterinary work but in the meantime have much better job prospects in a career that I still love!Also depending on where you live too make sure you’re factoring in traveling/living costs (if you haven’t already) and then also think about proximity to home and family if you need that support system!

Vet school is full of opportunities to make friends, whether in study groups or at happy hour (ours was every Friday). First laugh of most vet students?

Keep your sense of humor and you’ll be fine!I love the matting that comes in large rolls (usually 8 feet wide by however long you need.

In areas like wash stalls or grooming bays I prefer traditional stall mats- they hold up better to inpatient, pawing horsesI was a manager in a similar situation. The employee would be chronically late and insult coworkers. I was very aware we had a toxic employee and literally did everything I could to remedy the situation by removing them from our workplace. Out of respect for the team, everything was kept behind closed doors. The only people who knew exactly what was going on were the employee, myself, and our regional manager (it was a corporate practice). 

Your managers may be doing all they can at this point. Depending on state and company policy it might not be easy to let this employee go. I had to give 3 written warnings, then give a paid day off, then accept a letter of explanation from the employee for their behavior for consideration before we could fire them.Again, that probably varies. Toxic employees seem to know how to toe the line but not cross it. 

For example, the fact that this person routinely made coworkers cry was not anything I could write up. Clocking in late routinely was. After that warning, they started clocking in early (5-15min per shift).  Definitely a passive aggressive move.  Passive aggression I could not write up but the fact that it cost the company to pay for time/ overtime that hadn’t been scheduled was an offense that could be written up. 

No one wants to have a wrongful dismissal suit brought against them. Some also don’t have unemployment insurance and can’t afford to fire an employee so they are pressured to quit instead. Lots of factors apply.One of the practices I worked for early on was a single vet who was terrible at business. He desperately wanted to fire an employee because he quite simply did not like her. She caught wind of it and quit, he emphatically made sure everyone was aware she quit and that there was no way she could come after him for unemployment $$. And yes, in the US.

twinsuns,"I used right-handed instruments during school but now I use left-handed needle drivers for surgery, and left-handed scissors for necropsies. Makes my hands feel so much better!

Edit: my workplace buys them for me, maybe I'm lucky! My right-handed coworkers didn't ""get"" it until they grabbed my needle drivers by mistake. For one-off surgeries it's not a big deal but if you're doing it all day it can really start to hurt! And I do large animal necropsies in high bio containment... I refuse to struggle with the scissors in that environment.I've been there. On my general surgery rotation I wasn't expecting that they'd want us to close the skin with interdermal pattern. After my client spay the surgeon pulled me aside and said that I had good tissue handling but was behind my classmates in terms of the suturing skills etc. I felt really bad about it but went home and did a lot of practice.

Remember that your clinicians generally want you to succeed. They're giving you this feedback so you can apply it. Practice what you can with models at home, take any opportunity you can on the rotation to do the hands-on skill. Ask the techs for tips and to help you. This will demonstrate you taking the initiative, and you will be practicing, which should help both things they're critiquing you for. If you don't have a lot of experience, of course you're not going to be perfect--you just need to practice.

Take a breath, stay calm, be patient while you're doing the skill. You got this.

Being a vet is multifactorial--you've got the knowledge portion, surgery, technical skills, examination, people skills, etc. Just because you are lagging in one doesn't mean you can't be a great vet. And honestly, once you get out in practice, a lot of the technical skills get done by technicians... when I tape a catheter you can tell it was me because the techs' always look beautiful lol.","Veterinarian.

takethisonionring,"1. Put ""Veterinarian"" in to indeed with a wide enough area to include a large number of clinics
2. Send your cover letter (maybe) and resume to every ad willing to hire a new grad
3. Don't interview catastrophically
4. Repeat until you have 10 offers

In my mind it doesn't tell me anything other than that they cast a very wide net and were willing to interview and listen to an offer from a bunch of places. The market is tilted in favor of employees right now, solicit employers wanting to hire and chances are a bunch of them will offer you at least something.I went through the cycle three times, got interviews and was waitlisted twice, third time I got in right away and now I'm doing well finishing out my clinical year with some great options/leads for an internship and eventual small animal specialty residency. When I was applying I wanted to be a mixed GP. I think I over estimated how much the school cared about my narrative and how it fit with my experiences, they know most students change plans or at least consider other paths over their four years. What helped me between the second and third cycle was meeting with an admissions admin at the school and discussing where exactly I had the most room for improvement, for me specifically I just had to retake some prerequisite classes from my freshman year but obviously your milage may vary.I am a fourth year at a Midwestern Vet school and honestly practice stake for a new hire sounds more like a burden than a benefit unless your partners are willing to guarantee you will make at least some baesline profit share. For instance salary of 125 and guarantee at least 75k in take home for a guaranteed total of 200k sounds a lot more attractive.

We still hire those who don’t know if they will pas yet because realistically, all the new grads we hired before the navle results were released were chances we were taking. If the candidate fails again, we try to help them find another role within the clinic while they await their next testing window or place them in a clinic of ours that is in a state like Tennessee that allows you to practice under a provisional license for a year. If none of that works out, we move on to another candidate or fill the spot with an experienced DVM. 

I can’t speak for private practices if that’s the direction you’re taking.

2. What is PMTU value for path to location oracle: `tracepath location.mysterium.network`. We need all output, while the most important are the last lines of output, like `\`Resume: pmtu 1500 hops 14 back 13\``. On debian-like systems this utility is available in package`iputils-tracepath\`.

intothewoods_wego,"Definitely agree with other commenter about GPA. I also wish someone had told me that taking classes at a community college is way easier and cheaper (especially for intro science requirements). I struggled to get a decent grade in a large 200-300 person chem class at a state school and then took one over a summer at a local community college with 20 people and easily got an A. It made me wonder why I didn’t take every large class like that there.Basically the techs (both regular and VTS) actually run the anesthesia and recover patients while the anesthesiologist oversees everything. 

The anesthesiologist will approve drug protocols, assist techs if there’s an issue during a procedure, and also consult with other departments if they need help with premed/sedation protocols. Some also do phone consults with other practices that don’t have an anesthesiologist. 

Legally there isn’t anything different at this time between the duties of a VTS or VT (that I’m aware of), but because they have gone through the extra training the VTS may be more trusted with more complicated procedures or writing protocolsMCAT isn’t worth it at all unless you’re also considering human med. I wouldn’t do the GRE unless your instate school or a school you really want to go to required itYou can work as an assistant in the U.S. without a specific degree however it can be challenging to get a job without some sort of animal job experience like in a kennel or shelter volunteer or something. You can get a vet tech degree in two years if you go full time. Techs get paid more than assistants and are legally allowed to do more than assistants, however it might be best to work as an assistant for a bit to make sure you like it before pursuing a degree.I’m halfway through the program and I really enjoy it. Most professors seem genuinely interested in teaching/helping students and it also seems like the university listens to the student body at least somewhat. There is free in person tutoring the whole first year and lots of club events with free food. It also seems like clinical year is not as brutal here from what I’ve heard about other schools. 
If you’re into outdoorsy things it’s a great location. There’s a mountain range, reservoir, lots of hiking/camping nearby and something like 300 days of sun a year. It’s very bikeable but outside of campus it takes awhile to walk anywhere substantial. 
It’s a smaller city which could be a pro or a con depending on what you like but there’s a cute little downtown area with lots of shops and restaurants. 
Downsides about the program: the hospital is now under construction until spring 2026 which is annoying to navigate. They are trying to make more of the curriculum “team based learning” and they tried it out for one of my classes last semester and it went pretty poorly but hopefully they’ll fix that.  Happy to answer any questions!I usually have about 30hrs a week of lecture and labs combined. My first year I worked 8-12 hours because I had to and I found it pretty stressful/overwhelming at times honestly, but I think it was mostly because I just wasn’t used to the flow of vet school and studying. Now that I’m deeper into school I work around 6-10 and still workout and do most hobby/social things I want toOutside of vet med there are animal control officers, park rangers, zookeepers, wildlife rehab, zoologist/biologist, and animal trainers to name a few. 

There a lot of things you can also do within the veterinary field depending on the type of species you want to work with (large animal, equine, small animals, exotics/zoo, wildlife). Veterinarians and other vet staff can work in research/academia, clinical private practice, and industry jobs like in government agencies or pharmaceutical companies.Spay/neuter clinics and animal shelters usually always need volunteers. You could also see if there are any farm/horse sanctuaries or wildlife rehabs near you that need help to get experience that isn’t just small animal.I would highly recommend working as an assistant before applying to vet school so you really know what the field is like. If you’re set on being a veterinarian I don’t think it’s worth spending the time/money on getting a tech license first. In most states you can do a lot of tech things without a license.It doesn’t matter! Grades are more important than the institutionThe 2024 VMCAS is about to open (if it isn’t already) and is due September 2024. For most US schools, If you want to apply as an early admissions you would need to apply during this cycle in order to go to vet school in fall 2025. You will need to have it planned so your prereqs will be done by then. Not every school allows early entry and it varies how many out standing prereqs you can have at the time of application so you need to look into each school on their admissions websites. You can apply again as a traditional student in 2025 to be admitted fall 2026.You’ll apply to go to vet school after your undergrad (there are specific classes and experiences required to get in), and then after vet school most people do an ER mentorship program or rotating internship to get experience before working completely on their own. It might be a good idea to get a job in an ER before going to vet school for the experience!That’s awesome! Good luck out thereI couldn’t tell you about pay but I worked for them for 4 years as a tech before I went to vet school if you want to PM me about the company.

Katmaybeck,"I became a licensed vet tech in 2016 and I worked for Banfield for 2 years as one of my first jobs. Sure I gained a tremendous amount of experience but also became aware of the sketchy malpractice the vets were doing there. They had really weak anesthetic protocols and literally used TORB/MIDAZ premed for every surgery- spay, neuter, dentals, even tho butorphanol has the weakest analgesia and they were afraid of using hydromorphone thinking it was this scary drug when in fact it is an excellent choice for premed sedation and pain control. I witnessed so many pets waking up in pain bc the vets follow a cookie cutter formula and are afraid to practice quality medicine. 

They never educated the owners or showed them the teeth in the room so they were clueless on day of dental, no forewarning on what periodontal disease is. They waited until pet under and charted to try to call and often the client had no idea they needed to be available so they wouldn’t answer and we would have to wake up the pet. If the owner did happen to answer, the conversation was always a surprise for the client, they would be shocked at the extra cost and decline bc they don’t understand they needed “additional services”. If the vets did their job and educated and provided estimates prior there would be a lot more compliance and quality treatment, but not the case here. There was one doctor that hated dentals and extractions so much he would purposely avoid contacting the owner about the periodontal disease. He would call once and then immediately tell me to turn off when they didn’t answer, did not wait 5 min or try again. One time he waited until after I took my 1 hr lunch and came back to take his, even tho we were supposed to lunch together and do another dental after bc it was a longer one. Well he was trying to stall for time to avoid having to do extractions. I had to advocate for the pet and tell him the owner requested full mouth dental X-rays (even tho I had convinced her to do them at check in bc they were not included at the time for Banfield dentals). Well lo and behold the dog had like 9 tooth root abscesses and he is immediately pissed that he has to start pulling teeth. We of course don’t finish in time and have to wake up without doing them all. Another time I was cleaning/charting and told him both back molars were a little loose. He comes and checks them and think one is more loose than the other but I didn’t agree. Well he just decides to pick up the drill and start taking out this tooth without consent from owner, no dental block that I recall, and just did it in a forceful way out of anger. It was extremely alarming…

They do assembly line exams where they would just flip the lip of the canine tooth and that was it. Didn’t do a thorough check of back teeth or incisors which are often worse in small dogs. Even the medical director was in it for the money. She did the fastest “exams” I’ve ever seen and did not chart dentals properly. One time a relief vet was there and was saying how she always counts the teeth and discovered the 311 was dead but the medical director does not normally chart that thoroughly and seemed surprised (but actually this relief vet was doing her job properly and how it should be). Another time the medical director refused to provide solutions for this Yorkie with a heart murmur and horrible teeth bc she was “not gonna risk putting it under”. But heart murmur is not an automatic disqualification from anesthesia. She could have referred to specialty dentist. I took it upon myself to leave her a voicemail with information if she wanted to see a cardiologist/specialist bc the pet was suffering and needed full mouth extractions. But the vets didn’t care about the pets pain and oral disease there. 

Before they installed the digital dental X-rays we had analog and had to use dip tanks so we would rarely take them. I remember cleaning pets teeth with severe gingival recession, very deep pockets and furcation exposure. And we would just clean them and wake up. These same pets got dentals here for years and then when we finally get X-rays discover 9 tooth abscess. So imagine how many pets were never getting proper extractions of diseased teeth and just getting them “cleaned”. That does not get rid of the pain and infection so those pets all continued to suffer from Banfield their whole lives!! Sadly this is not just a Banfield problem, but a nationwide problem for practices that still do not offer digital dental X-rays OR who still think it’s ok to take dental X-rays “as needed” when they think a tooth is bad. But in reality X-rays are the only way to diagnose pathology 100% so don’t go anywhere that doesn’t take full mouth X-rays for every dental!

I soon after found a veterinary dental practice and left Banfield. I would NEVER recommend anyone to work there or bring their pet there. I felt the pets were neglected in the kennels for hours, received incomplete physical exams and substandard treatment in general. The whole culture of Banfield is about pushing the most amount of pets to be seen in a day, maximizing the wellness plan signups, and a greedy profit driven agenda. Literally they would post signs on the walls that said “12 drop offs before 12” or something like that. Techs had to often pull blood and place catheters by themselves bc people would call out or quit all the time. It was just utter chaos at all times.

Obviously this was a single Banfield horror story but I know it’s not the only one. I also did a relief shift once at another Banfield and it was soooo disorganized and clutter everywhere. They also NEVER entered the lab results for anything in house I noticed- cytologies, skin scrapes, FeLV tests in the computer. I’m not sure how they were able to get by with this? Bc if the pet came for a recheck you wouldn’t know the previous results? Maybe they would just put in the notes, I’m not sure but lots of things in their woofware records were SUS. I know the Banfield agenda is the same everywhere but I’m sure some vets practice much higher quality than in the clinic where I worked so maybe there is hope for some of these places but I would not trust them.Maybe it has to do with… I’ve been in the field 11 years, RVT for 7. and I was just rejected to vet school this year. It’s my first time and only 1 school (closest to home) so I get it buttt I had a pretty competitive application IMO… so it leaves a bit of resentment in my mouth when I work with new grads who literally act like it’s there first day working with pets every day. 🤷🏻‍♀️I agree. I think it comes down to narcissism at the end of the day. If you are working with narcissists they will never admit fault, always point blame, become extremely defensive and sensitive to criticism but will dish it out like no other 🙄 I’ve had to leave many employers due to this type of attitude. At the end of the day I am an experienced licensed tech and do know what I’m talking about. I’ve had to deal with a lot of narcissists who just can’t be corrected bc they can’t admit they were wrong!! but also if you don’t believe in yourself and listen to these doubters and haters in this field, you will let things like that get to your head, like I did and almost left the industry. It’s a very hard lesson I’ve had to learn but you got to have tough skin in this field!!! FACTS. Just trusting yourself and your gut will be enough to tune out the rest of the BS (as long as it’s factually correct 😉). ✌🏼I’d say yes you are qualified to be a doctor… by veterinary medical board standards. However there is alot of on the job experience that only comes with time, wisdom and growth. I notice the new grads I’ve worked with don’t seem confident or experienced dealing with situations others have already learned from so it’s hard to extend that compassion to someone that you EXPECT to be the EXPERT. believe me I have corrected MANY DOCTORS. So please do not think you are above a tech because you have the title. Respect is earned with experience. Do not be afraid to ask them a question? Or your other colleagues. We all want to be treated as equals and all in all I do not feel that the veterinarian application system validates those who have worked very hard through blood sweat and tears for this career and still going!!

fran_grc,"Im not from the US. A quick search on Wikipedia shows Banfield isnt the best partner, apparently.Oh, it WILL run, but you wont know it did not worked until it's finished!! Every rotor is a surprise. Did I put some air? Will it show some unexpected error? Who knows!!On the ovaries everything went perfect, so I think it's alright. Thank you kindly!Thanks!Thanks for your words. I guess all my fears comes from my first job where we perfomed only ovariectomies through a very small incision and with a hook. And boy did I hated the thing, I was not trained at all on that technique and I always was afraid of hooking the spleen blood vessels lol. Anyway, each time I made a bigger incision to work comfortably I was yelled at and told that the incision had to be under 2 nanometres, or that was my impression at the time.

God, how much damage bad workplaces can do to a young vet?If any, the horn part wouldnt be larger than 1-2 mm, and I always put some fat tissue over the incision to avoid intestine adherences. But you are right, next time I will make a longer incision to be sure and comfortable making knots.

After all it never cease to surprise me how fast and well cats recover from surgery so a few mm more wont make a difference. Thank you!!I hesitated at first but I think one cannot grow without the help of others and this subreddit is a good place to find other vets and ask that question you feel ashamed to ask.I am not from the US so I did not have to pass that exam but I know what's having a big test and feeling overwhelmed. Even if it seems paradoxical, giving myself some rest helped me a lot, specially having small walks outdoors for 5-10 minutes. I felt like my brain worked so much better, I was able to remember much better what I just read before taking a break.

This is not surprising as the brain is an organ like any other and if you put too much stress on it, it's more likely that it suffers from it. Giving this resting times may improve a lot cognitive functions so maybe give it a try!

I wish you the best!There’s a shortage of radiologists out there. If you could get and finish a residency you could work/read from home.

Ultimately, if an owner isn't going to come into your consult room with an open mind and listen then you won't change their mind.

chickencutlet33,"Please move on and find another job. It is one thing for a job to be challenging, difficult, even stressful. But it is another thing for it to make you persistently unhappy. You don’t deserve that, and there are no doubt better places for you to work, even if it might take a while to find them. 

I’m not sure what kind of practice you’re at but I recently switched from ER to a small clinic at a government animal shelter, and I like the shelter job a million times better. While I was at the ER I was convinced that I was terrible at my job and I hated myself every day. After switching environments I can recognize that I wasn’t a bad employee, I was just new to vet med and the ER wasn’t willing to train me, which made me feel useless all the time. I’m learning a ton at my new job and my coworkers are much nicer.

Just sharing this to encourage you to find a work environment that brings out the best in you. You don’t have to leave the field entirely just because of a toxic workplace! Good luck with everything :-)In my experience if you are a CSR wanting to learn VA/VT skills, you have to be really forward about asking for opportunities. My first veterinary job I was hired as an assistant but put up front in reception due to my lack of experience. I had to spend a lot of time getting comfortable with reception but I took every chance I could find to learn about assistant tasks. I asked the clinic manager if I could be responsible for filling medications, which kind of moved me to the back and was a good way to transition from strictly answering phone calls. As I spent more time in the back filling meds I asked techs if they needed help with anything or if I could practice my restraint on their easy patients. I just kept going from there trying to gain new skills.

If you’d like to strictly remain a CSR I think this is possible in some clinics, but I’m sure you will be encouraged to at least learn the basics of assisting in case staffing is short or there is an emergency up front","Veterinarian.

Are grades solely based on exam results or do projects count as well? What year are you currently in? Feel free to pm me if you don't want to leave details in the thread.Do you work while going to school full time? I'm not sure whether or not this would be possible, and I want to be able to contribute financially somewhat, as I feel bad putting all the financial burden on my husband.Which school are you going to? To your knowledge is the course the same regardless of where you attend?A bit late to try for Nottingham and I don't want to pass up on the opportunity of saying no to Bristol and then never getting in anywhere else in the future. Sad to hear this though.Good to know the lectures are great!

  
What's your impression on the difficulty of the course.. as in would one be able to work part time while going to school full time?   


Edit: AddingThanks!I appreciate your response. I have a fairly strong background in animal science and I completed the Access Veterinary Science course just recently to fulfill the ""recent education requirement"" as I've been out of post-secondary for quite som time now.

For your accelerated program, are you basically in class from 9-5? Or what does your typical day/week look like?I'm about to start vet school when I'm 35, and I'll graduate when I'm 40. It's never too late!Vet student here. I love problem solving and enjoy medicine, plus animals are better than people (yes I know we're also animals). I also wanted to be able to help fill the need for veterinarians in my area - I often think how terrible it is for owners who can't help their pet due to lack of access to veterinary professionals.A friend of mine went through vet school but had massive loans and she wasn't able to work during her time in school as she was in an accelerated 4 year program. She's working now and is paying her loans off.

I'm about to head to vet school as an adult and luckily I am going into it with savings as I've been working for the past decade or so. I also have a partner, and my parents are willing to loan me money to pay for expenses. I do plan on working part time while going to school, as I've talked to a number of current and past students who said they were able to hold down a part time job while going to school full time. My plan is to leave with as little loans as possible but I also won't forgo passing school in order to work and will take on more loans if necessary.","Other.

Kit-KatLasagna,"This is how I was trained as well. I cried often. I learned to put my hand up and say “STOP. I can NOT learn this way. Either teach me how I’m asking or I’m done here. I don’t deserve to be spoken to like this.” That earned me the respect of ONE doctor. Not anybody else (luckily it was the doctor that mattered). This career takes whoever they can get and tries to flip them into a tech. It’s a toxic way of practicing. I am currently training someone who is in a similar position and I’m trying so hard not to be the person I once hated. Don’t be afraid to stop people in their tracks and say “this is counterproductive”. Tell people exactly what you need. “I need you to let me do this while you watch, and I need to repeat it at least 5 times for me to get it.”I bought the VA program and didn’t finish. It’s a great program but go straight for tech. Maybe give yourself some time in the field before you commit. I spent 4 years thinking I’d go for CVT and as soon as I got accepted I realized I didn’t want to spend that long in the field. You need an AA typically to apply anyways. If you don’t have that already it gives you time to see if it’s what you want. Or just go for it! It’s your life.","Other.

I’ve been avoiding any masked procedures, making sure the iso is off for flipping the patient during dentals (which should be standard but def doesn’t happen all the time), and make sure the oxygen runs for a few minutes before disconnecting. I have to be careful about the last one of course, in case they wake up quickly, but it hasn’t been an issue. I also let other people refill if we’re getting low.Good pointThe clinic I work at collects payment for euths first so clients can leave without having to talk to anyone once they’ve said goodbye. The CSRs can present it as, “let’s take care of this first so you can leave in peace” vs “we cannot euthanize until you pay.” The framing matters; people always will settle up with us first without getting upset. Maybe the CSRs aren’t receiving great training and it’s leaving them unsupported to the point where they keep calling in. A place with low morale can turn around, but it needs a good leader to do so.We just euthanized a cat this week for not being able to void his bladder on his own. He’s been leaking urine since a PU he had done years prior elsewhere, and owners report he hasn’t been great about voiding on his own since.

bobleponge_,"This was an incredible read. This needs to be published somewhere. I want every student considering or in an internship/residency to read it, and everyone in charge of interns/residents (DVMs, HMs, all of them) to read it too. We have to break the cycle, interns and residents (hopefuls and currents) need to be able to advocate for themselves without putting their careers at risk.Can you label areas and then have them coordinate with the chart and each person is assigned to an area?

Ex:

Area A- surgical tools

Items present: x amount of packs, x amount of gowns, etc

Daily cleaning: x tasks

Scheduled cleaning:

Sun

Mon

Tues

Etc

Or have like “floors” “drawers” “counters” etc as the areas whatever worksSpayin AliveI can guarantee with 100% certainty that your internship mates have made “mistakes” too (and I say “mistakes” because not all of them are truly mistakes but maybe just different approaches/not how that hospital does things but aren’t inherently incorrect). Every single vet alive has gaps in their knowledge, has bad days, and makes mistakes. 

Take a deep breath, go see a therapist, and remember you is kind, you is smart, you is important, and mostly importantly, you MATTER and are LOVED.We had a locum that only did surgeries at a clinic I used to tech at, mainly ones the main dvm didn’t want to do. They would occasionally do some room appointments if needed, but was primarily there for surgery. And they were a GP. 

I would say if a GP could generate enough money just doing sx/dentals and could prove they could generate it, a practice would be open to it, especially in a HQHVSN setting.

Icy_External6132,"Depending on your definition of ""worth"" 

If you're talking about earning ""big money"", being a vet (GP) is not the best option. Of course it is still achievable if you're a specialist. 

To me, it's ""worth it"" as i get to do quite a bit of hands on, and I feel happy from being able to help my patients to recover from illness (not all the cases, but we always do our best). The journey of investigating the root cause of issues may be challenging, but it's definitely worth it, even if it's a bad or good diagnosis. 

Till now (only about 3+ years of working experience), I am constantly learning even during my off days. I join classes, webinars, wet labs...... yes it's tiring but it's worth it as I get to learn new things! 

Dealing with the clients is definitely tiring, and sometimes I may feel it is not ""worth it"" as people tend to turn away due to the cost, or they feel that their pet ""doesn't require the treatment / prevention/ tests"" recommended. I do feel bad for my patient, but in the end, the owner is the one spending, so I have to respect their decision. 

Lastly, occasionally i feel it is not worth it as I overworked. My job is 5.5 days/ week and about 8.5 hours a day, but I usually spend about 10-12 hours depending on my ""to do lists"". 

Dealing with your emotion/ mental health is definitely important. Sometimes I just stay in my room doing nothing (literally nothing, just to get myself rested); sometimes I go for a walk; sometimes I read something (non vet or science related) at a cafe; sometimes I hangout with my friends (talk about life and avoids anything work related)........ you just have to find your own way! 

Good luck! (:","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it discusses experiences and challenges related to veterinary practice",Veterinarian

30 is an age where most people may have already entered their chosen industry, but are still fighting for their dream position. You get to be a vet, that's so many peoples DREAM and it's YOURS TOO. So again, I feel like that's hugeNo waaaaaay I didn't know this! Not sure how the licensing translates but I'll look into it ty:)It's not the debt itself, it's the type of debt. The loan my bank will offer requires me to pay 20k per month while I'm in school, and it won't even pay the entire tuition lol it's crazyYeah the competition is the problem. I'm competitive at many schools that ARENT my home school. I'm not even going to try lol not that it doesn't still feel like a long shot elsewhere 😵‍💫That's great advice thank you:)I don't even know how to go through the government, I've only been looking at bank loans 😂💀Canadian schools are brutal 🥲 if I could I would lol
Not that it isn't bad everywhere elseNo those are the numbers the bank gave me. Although they'd only offer 150k which would be 20k each month, so I rough estimated if I managed to get the whole thing. I'm asking how things are done because I know that's CRAZY lol if I could afford that I wouldn't need them 💀 but maybe the advisor I met with was new, I could inquire again🥲No, I was looking at Australian, UK, and Caribbean schools 🥲Yeah I'm looking abroad 🥺Yeah I spoke to a couple of schools and they consensus is ""just get a loan! Easy peasy!"" 😂☹️You'd think so, but those are the numbers the bank gave me 😅 if it were 20k each year I wouldn't be worried. Can I ask where you got your line of credit from and where you go to school?I can, I'm just frustrated at the timing cuz I'm in my late twenties already and I want to be done with school one day 😅Yeah the vet I worked for recently was going through that, he'd just started his residency at a surgery clinic  years after graduating :((No, you're right, so is everyone else saying it. :(That's true... the move honestly seems like just as big a stretch for a maybe as the overseas prices 😅 definitely worth considering though, thanks:)","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

kcomid,"I’ve been in the field for almost 30 years (wildlife rehabber, tech, vet) and I can’t count the number of times I’ve burnt out.  Right now the only thing that is keeping me in the field is working three 10ish hour days and having 4 days off.   In my state 32hr/wk is full time so I get the FT benefits but have FOUR days off each week.  Being away more from work is the only thing that is keeping me sane.Urgent care surgeon in a metro area.  $90K, 3 days/week to get full time benefits (on average work less than 30 hr/wk).  CE-$2,500.  Took a pay cut but my QOL is soooo much better—basically have no stress in this job compared to my last one (shelter med)I would add what benefits are included: health insurance, CE $, liability/disability, staff discount, PTO,etc.  Nowadays people want to know more than just salary and duties before applying. (I’m an ex shelter vet now urgent care surgeon in MN).I have worked PT in 2 clinics doing only surgeries and currently work FT at an urgent care clinic only doing surgery.  So it can happen and definitely in the current market one can request surgery only (or majority surgery).","Veterinarian.

xiaopow0310,"Like the other commenter says, it’s never too late. I went straight into college after hs and didn’t know what I wanted to do. Then my senior year of college I started volunteering with reptiles and was like “wow. I can’t see myself doing anything else.” 

Finished up my Econ degree (useless) and started taking classes for vet school alongside working at a clinic, first as a kennel tech then as a vet assistant. Fast forward to today, I’m 4 weeks from finishing up my 2nd year of vet school at the ripe old age of 27

(Also procrastinating studying for my clin path exam by posting on Reddit)I have ADHD. It’s rough but my school is really accommodating and understanding to my needs. As for the clinical sides of things idk why but the chaos really vibes with my brain. I think if you’re burning out from studying but are still having a good time from doing appointments and stuff maybe keep trying and see if it gets better. If not then no shame in picking something that’s better for your mental healthIt depends on where they’re working. Like I have my own stethoscope but my clinic also have a couple lying around for free use so I don’t ever have to bring mine. But if I ever leave my watch at home, I’m second guessing every heart rate or respiratory rate I get. Plus there’s a ton of time based stuff needed for vet med too but I guess if there’s a clock in the clinic it would be less useful 😅Nah. I got classmates that are in their 30s and one person in the class above mine was in her 60s. I was 24 when I applied for vet school and will be 29 when I graduate. I didn’t know what I wanted to do in college and didn’t decide until second semester my senior year.Well. Looks like I’m moving to socal and becoming an internistNot a vet yet (2 more years woo) but have dealt with very similar people in both my rescue and clinical experiences. I just have to ignore them. Yes it upsets me but at the end of the day it’s their animals, their choices, and their money. They have to make their decisions and all I can do is try to educate them. If the animal is in a bad enough position I’ll just call animal control and let them know the situation. We can’t help everyone but we can help those that want it. 

Those ads do piss me off tho but not like I can do much about it :/I appreciate the kind words! I also noticed your name. I want to be a reptile vet as well!The rage. 

All kidding aside it’s because I worked in non-profit and saw that nobody was really standing up for reptiles so I want to be a reptile vet to help those that have less of a voice than our more furry animalsMaybe I haven’t committed many crimes but when do cops say “don’t swallow that”","Veterinarian.

Fattestcattest1990,Completely agreed. I worked for a corporate and they priced themselves out so far that clients had to pay for their care plans to afford care. So clients had a monthly payment instead of having to pay a much higher one time cost for an annual. However you as the vet receive a significantly smaller commission on their care plans compared to clients on no plan. So it screwed the vets. You better believe they priced it that way on purpose so it’s a win win for them - make more on the client or pay the vet less. Either way the corporate gets more money in their pocket.I worked for a private hospital and the doctor said to “ignore” the section written about negative accrual on my contract. He said he doesn’t keep track. One year later he asked me for $5000 citing me using me PTO and CE as times when production counted against me and I needed to pay him back. So essentially I paid for my PTO and CE. It was bullshit and I left soon after. Just say no to negative accrual. You don’t need to have a reason. It’s archaic and honestly just breeds distrust with your employer. Vets are in demand. There is no reason to sign a contract with negative accrual or non-competes anymore.,"Veterinarian.

CatPolitics101,"I would look into the animal shelter where you currently work for any job openings as a vet assistant. Your biggest strength will be your ability to handle/restrain animals, so focus on that. There is no shame in using muzzles until you are 100% comfortable. 

After you get some experience, then look into jobs at a GP. Working in GP will allow you to broaden your experience further with more complex surgeries and routine vet care. Working in GP will also allow you more time to go back to school if you decide to do so. 

Now, if you're anything like me, you'll want to go into emergency medicine. I switched from GP to ER 2 years ago and I'll never go back. I'm not licensed (yet), but I still get to do most hands on things, except for what only a licensed tech can do. I focus primarily on inpatient care, so I perform venipuncture, administer medications and treatments, monitor anesthesia, scrub in for surgery, take radiographs, you name it. I make $25 an hour currently and am on track to make $27 by the end of next year. I only make this amount because I work in ER, GP usually pays less. 

I also made the change from corporate America 4 years ago, and I've never looked back. There is a hell of a learning curve, and often pushback depending on your clinic, but it has been so rewarding. Just be patient with yourself because there is a lot to learn, but it will come with time.It's definitely a thing. It's less common in smaller GPs, but happens alot in ER and specialty.","Veterinarian.

Morgimeister,"This is fantastic, absolutely try to get this published.

Saw that one of your references is from Dr. Chigerwe at Davis, which I find ironic (not that you used him, but surprised he published something on this topic) as I saw him do absolutely nothing to prevent the abuse of veterinary students and his residents when I was there 2016-2019. Maybe things have changed, but when I worked for C Barn I saw his residents working 100 hour weeks regularly, sleeping at the barn when they could, skipping meals, and being reduced to tears on a regular basis. When I rotated through C Barn as a 4th year with him I was there 80-100h/week. He also mandated that vet students work outdoors without providing appropriate respiratory PPE during the California Camp fires when the air quality in Davis was the worst in the WORLD. Let’s just say I’m very much not a fan.I think things have changed, going home at 6pm was absolutely unheard of when I was at Davis and especially on C barn. Per the 4th year below, it does seem things have improved.I’m happy you had a different experience. Again, I graduated in 2019, so before you matriculated, and I know that some things have changed since then. I’ve been told 4th year students are no longer required to provide 6am/6pm treatments? So that does help to shorten a day significantly. I never heard of a 6pm cutoff time, especially since that’s when evening treatments were due.

I was also livestock track and worked in C barn for 2.5 years as a Barn Nurse. I spent 5 weeks in C barn (as one of my rotations fell during a holiday) and can only speak to my experiences seeing how students and residents were treated during my time, so I did so. I do feel that Dr. Chigerwe is a fantastic clinician and lecturer, and I felt that in lecture, he was very sensitive and responsive to student questions and mental health issues. This was not the case in clinic. I’m sorry to say it seemed like a trend - I saw more than one incidence where an exhausted student or resident was openly sobbing and he reacted in an absolutely frigid way. On one day while on rotation with Chigerwe, I was told to show back up at 6am after working a 14h day and then being called in overnight, so had at best an hour of sleep. I’m sorry to speak negatively of a colleague but my experiences with him left such an impression as to make me overprotective of my own veterinary student externs (I now work in high volume spay/neuter because I enjoyed the extensive surgery experience we had on livestock track). 

I agree that the major issue is systemic, but when individuals feed into the system it helps to perpetuate it. I think that calling colleagues out on behavior that goes against the tenants set out by the AVMA is not only acceptable, but necessary to protect ourselves. If you saw a veterinary colleague abusing animals, would you not fail to act or say something? It’s time we did the same for each other. It is the faculty’s job to advocate for those who are trying to learn from them and I’m happy that he is now appearing to do so.It honestly doesn’t sound then like things have changed enough, even as you defend him.

Even if you slept every single one of those 6h instead of taking care of whatever other human needs you’ve been neglecting, we know anything less than 7h has an impact on your mental and physical health: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK19961/ . We are doctors who should be basing decisions from peer-reviewed research, so I’m curious how Dr. Chigerwe arrived at the idea that 6h off is acceptable. Perhaps the mental toll of chronic sleep deprivation is why I’m aware of several egregious medical and surgical errors on the part of the residents in C Barn. And I can’t hardly fault them because with that degree of chronic sleep deprivation, they were essentially trying to be doctors under the same effects as heavy intoxication. And why hasn’t the livestock service hired more student workers or technicians to perform technician duties as they do on other services? Instead of forcing these tasks on paying 4th year students? Again, it’s not enough, and Dr. Chigerwe has more power than you think to do more. Again, please believe the possibility that I had a different experience than you. Sure, we all know there are faculty who are even worse in their treatment of students and residents, but they are typically well known within a teaching hospital. It is not ironic to call out abuse when it’s seen, particularly if that person is clever at hiding abuse behind outward projections of caring about student and resident health and wellbeing.Thank you for the context. I’m sure things have improved, maybe more than marginally. Were the errors I saw rare? I don’t know. I’m going to exclude the years I worked as a barn nurse. In my first C barn rotation as a fourth year, a resident microwaved colostrum at high temp, instead of gently warming it in a hot water bath. The calf it was intended for developed failure of passive transfer, and that calf had to be euthanized due to unresolving infections. This resident unfortunately had so many animals die under his care that he had a nickname that included the word “doomsday”. That same rotation, a dairy cow received an extended inappropriate banamine dosage and frequency, and we had to call poison control as part of a CYA to get a treatment plan together to treat the iatrogenic exposure. One of my classmates who was on a following rotation was sliced open by a different resident while they were performing a fetotomy and he had to go to urgent care. A few days later, this same resident accidentally removed a section of a sheep’s colon after failing to identify it as belonging to the GIT and the animal ultimately had to be euthanized. 

Does this frequency seem like extremely rare occurrences to you? If so, I’d be very concerned about animals under your care when you graduate.

Not an error, but looking back on my texts with classmates from that time, another classmate missed several learning opportunities including a goat mastectomy because she was told by Chigerwe that she had to muck out her own patients’ stalls because there wasn’t enough staff to do it. Is that an education?

I know it can be hard to have your mentors criticized, so I understand the defensive attitude. I’ve been disillusioned many times over the years and it can be a painful process. Fortunately, Reddit is a forum that is intended for individuals to share first hand accounts using a (thin) veil of anonymity. I have never spoken in an actual public forum about the very real experiences I had with Dr. Chigerwe and C Barn, which is honestly regrettable. It is very silly to be admonished on veterinary professional behavior by a student who is 5 years my junior and who still hasn’t worked a day in their life as a DVM. It is also silly to attempt to censor someone on Reddit. I suppose I admire the confidence? It’s confidence I wish I had to speak out sooner against the culture of toxicity and abuse I experienced and witnessed those years. Regardless, cheers to you on the confidence, as it means Davis hasn’t crushed your spirit. And good luck getting to the finish line!Female, small animal. Deep South. HVSN, small amount of wellness only. 30h/week. 96k + 15% commission for wellness. 5 weeks PTO. 2.5k for CE.

Clearly lower salary but I was looking for great work/life balance and I got it :) relief sometimes for extra $$.

Edit: job also qualifies for PSLF. 4 years left and hopefully my student loan sins will be forgiven 🤞🏻Does the urgent care position include benefits and/or production? That seems somewhat low considering that 36h/week FT ER doctors often make at least twice that.Agreed! It was initially 4 but I easily negotiated another week, no questions asked by my employer. Now I can’t go back, lol.Definitely don’t mind!No of course not! Feel free!I just want to chime in that fourth year was the worst vet med ever got for me, and I had it fairly easy in terms of my rotations because I was a public health student. Fourth year is not at all representative of what life can be like following graduation. The DVM degree gives you so much flexibility in terms of all the fields you can go into. I’m in shelter medicine/HVSN now and I have 5 weeks PTO, and only work 30h/week (becoming the norm in shelter/GP). Not to discredit your suffering now but if you stick it out you can definitely make it to a bright future with great work/life balance, and one that is generally NOT available to working moms in other professions. Heck you can even work from home for poison control and make 6 figures (something I did for a couple of years).DM me!Yes I’ll message you now!Yall acting like this isn’t a thing. Maybe it’s just where I’m located but I do HQHVSN and have GP’s breaking down my door for me to come in and just do relief spay/neuter for them. There’s definitely a market for it here, but I’m in the south so it might be different north/west.","Other.

We have a beautiful campus & teaching hospital. Tons of hands-on experience with live animals, and a unique communication curriculum that has simulated client interactions with actors. As a first year student I’ve already done neuters and have had plenty of opportunities to practice physical exams on live animals (I’ve probably done close to 50 full physical exams at this point, by participating in mandatory activities, TNRs, and volunteer events).

redheadfitz,"Wow, sounds like the overall culture has  changed very  little. I was a minority intern in small animal there in the 90's.  So much fear, and anxiety.

I was made to see a therapist for ""my problem"".  (So they have been doing that for a while). I admit there was a shit rolls downhill attitude,  and it took a while for me to learn to help with students who were afraid of me as well. I am sorry for anyone that I made feel less, but the pressure to not screw up was phenomenal.  Cut to the ""me too"" and ""black lives matter"" movements- I contacted your  department of diversity.  Just to see if that sort of crap was still happening.  I hoped it was better. Also to see if I could finally get my intern certificate( I still havent gotten it, even though it was promised 3 or 4 years ago)  The part that really infuriates me, is that a I found out a  surgeon there was really against my doing a surgical residency- even though I had been told multiple times I was very talented, and did a lot of solo surgery there- and that he had done the same thing to other african american candidates.

It’s probably because the seasoned techs / seasoned nurses have more clinical experience and a better understanding of certain concepts but if they’re blatantly disrespecting you I would say something.

Derangedstifle,"Sounds like somebody didn't communicate the clinic membership wellSome people do three or four internships, but it would be uncommon for you to do only a rotating and get a position. Most people have to do a rotating and then a surgical internship.I can give you information and realities about vet school in Ontario and maybe loosely about AVC though I have not applied to avc. I'm not graduated and not interested in being a formal mentor but happy to chat if you need casual advice.Social media is a cesspit of knee jerk emotional reactions and moral grandstanding. It is decaying our society. Sorry you're going through this. I'm a student and don't have experience this problem but your options sound fine to me from an ethical perspective. People are just lashing out because you can call the procedure declawing.
This is where I think you need to be exceptionally careful in communicating with the owner when you make your initial recommendation especially depending on their target demographic, as people under 35 these days generally love to post their lives on SM and get feedback from the ether.You'll me in massive debt in both fields, you'll just be more comfortable paying off your debt as an MD. It's entirely up to youYeah specialists are much more comfortable for sure and all the procedure/task oriented services can typically work as hard as they want in busy areas. GP pay is getting better but only in the context of rising housing costs and general inflation. Unfortunately vet med by nature will be behind the curve of human med because we will simply never spend as much on animal medical care as humans. Also it's a pretty select few who can become DACVS hahaWhy let other people's actions ruin an entire category of practice for you? You're the boss now, you can find a practice that suits you and be in control of how things happen.That's a wild deposit. Sorry I can't help, mine was like 7k CAD. I would ask family for help and then pay them back with your line of credit once you obtain your confirmation of enrolment. I would caution you to plan a detailed budget right now though to see if vet school is even feasible for you, seeing as how you're asking this and presumably don't have massive parental support. I'm from Ontario and going to school in the UK. The maximum student line of credit I could get through TD was 140k for four years, or 35k per year, and then OSAP my provincial/federal student funding package gave me about 15k per year on top of that. Those are my only two funding sources and together they don't even cover all of my tuition. If I didn't have substantial help from family I would be short about 40k per year in funding.I think you're taking this quite personally. Yeah it's not ideal or appropriate for this owner to have given the vaccines. Does that mean she has no respect for you as a vet? Probably not. She probably wouldn't try to go and cut a foreign body out of her own animal, she would pay a vet to do it. If anything it's more of an approval-seeking behaviour to try and do something really basic like give a vaccine yourself that you aren't technically supposed to do, she's trying to come up to your level rather than the opposite.
Also, people will always value animals less on average than other people, so yes there will always be MDs who feel they understand animal medicine because they understand human medicine.Cool and if that happened they would probably take their puppy to the vet ER, just like if their puppy were stung by a bee or suddenly developed angioedema. Yes they probably could technically start an IV and deliver a reasonable medication, the dose could be referenced quickly online in my country. Should they do that? Probably not. Do they have the equipment handy in their living room? Probably not. You act like just because it's an animal that human medics would be essentially reading a foreign language trying to do anything with their pet. You only do us a disservice by trying to dig trenches between us and the rest of medicine.Yeah so it's also animal abuse for farmers to vaccinate their herds/flocks as well. We should demand that all farm animals be vaccinated by veterinarians only, because clearly vets are the only people competent to do so.
Also we should immediately stop all SQ fluids at home for renal cats, because owners can't possibly be trusted to administer SQ fluids by themselves. This is the grossest form of animal abuse, because you're giving maybe 20-30x the volume of a vaccine subcutaneously.Yeah you're right so let's keep all pets for several hours of obs after we vaccinate, because we know animals never survive mass histamine release.I was being facetious. Farmers by necessity have to inject the animals the own many many times in life.
I'd be interested to know what country you live in. That's not the case in north America nor in the UK as far as I know.You're very entitled to your opinions. I actually work exceptionally well in teams and will be in this profession for a LONG time. Being senior doesn't mean you have all the answers. You failed to address my point that we vaccinate thousands of animals a day across multiple countries and then send them home immediately to have their anaphylactoid reactions. Do those animals not make it to the ER? Why don't we keep them in for obs overnight? How is the risk dramatically different vaccinating at home?
Also let me tell you it's a terrible thing to predict someone will kill themselves and you should know better.There is still a relative shortage of veterinarians if not an absolute one. You can make arguments about pay but the fact is there aren't enough veterinarians applying for and accepting jobs for the number of clinics looking for vets. This is a shortage.
I would look at the combination of factors which the pandemic exacerbated, including pay, abuse, working hour expectations, mental health, etc. to understand why vets aren't staying in the profession.Would you expect a newly graduated MD to be able to handle urethral obstruction, an RTA or an obese OHE? I think it's ridiculous to expect new grad vets be able to handle these problems effectively and to be able to make nuanced medical decisions. They should definitely understand the thinking behind management of these cases but I think youre being a bit reductionist in suggesting new grads are inadequate if they can't do these things.Nobody expects a new grad to go out on day one and spay 20 adult, overweight dogs though. That's just not realistic. Being common doesn't mean something should be easy. We all know the adult spay is a very challenging procedure. We also all know that new grads start with cats and then do puppies before taking on bitches. I think you're just completely out of touch with reality here.
MI is very common in people as well but they don't just throw year one interns into the Cath Lab to treat people do they?Definitely cannot flick the iv catheter before it goes into the skin unless you've scrubbed your hands and are wearing sterile glovesLmao I think you need to get some life experience before you decide to pursue vet school. Pharmacy might be a better choice.Don't do it because you love animals. If you love animals, volunteer in an animal shelter while doing some sort of work that you enjoy, or work in a different capacity that helps animals.I don't think there are extenuating circumstances in the match, though I've not gone through the process. If you were to drop out I think you might have to say goodbye to opportunities to specialize.Titres don't guarantee protection, you still need RIG and a booster series if you get bitten.If you're not so keen on science I would seriously rethink vet med as it is primarily a career of science. Loving animals is actually quite far down on the list No, even people in vet school who are supposed to be ""good at science"" struggle immensely with the sheer volume of content they need to read, understand and assimilate so rapidly. People who don't like science but just want to help animals are the people who tend to burn out of vet school because they can't keep up, or if they can it's unsustainable for four years.Someone from Germany can comment but I'm fairly certain most Germans speak English better than Americans. Europe is very multilingual. You should learn German but you'd be fine. Do your degree in England or Scotland and then move to Germany as they're generally accredited in the EU.You can, but I'm not sure how many American schools are also accredited by the EAEVE. I think most British schools are. You would want to go to an EAEVE accredited school to move to Europe afterwardsStats is the most challenging math you'll need to understand. The rest of it is multiplication and division. It's not hard mathYou can only administer standard first aid, as you are effectively a lay personYou could definitely lose your license for trying to practice medicine on people


Good Samaritan laws only protect you if you're providing reasonable first aid (chest compressions, applying pressure, washing a wound). If you as a vet go around trying to intubate people at the scene of a crash and provide ALS level care, you're absolutely fucked and they won't protect you at alltourniquets fall under good samaritan care especially with american gun violence. look at Stop The Bleed for advice if you want. in fact as a vet to be i'd recommend supporting your local community by taking the course, becoming an instructor and training laypeople in hemorrhage controlHaving a DVM isn't why you're referred to as doctor in clinic. Your job is distinct from your degree. You're referred to as doctor because you're licensed to practice vet medicine.Do you really want to reinforce the Dr name as much as possible?The general public will never understand most degree titles without substantial exposure to academia somehow. Many don't even really understand how MDs are different from PhDs. This is why I harp on about how title clarity is very important, more so in human medicine where many allied health fields have doctoral professional degrees these days (pharmD, DPT, DNP etc). See I disagree. Your title comes from the job you are employed in and your medical license, and has nothing to do with your degree. It's a very america-centric thing to suggest that you are a doctor because of your DVM. What about MVBs, BVMSs, BVetMeds? Are they not doctors then? The DVM that never licenses or practices. They are a DVM but would you like your clients and nurses asking them for advice or diagnoses or orders in your clinic during a visit just because they have a DVM degree?Your doctoral degree gives you access to the title in daily life but PhDs generally dont go around referring to themselves as Dr xyz in hospitals or clinics, except for the super self-important, because in that context doctor is assumed to refer to physician, MD or in our case veterinarian. Yes, when you get the degree you are a ""doctor"", but you're not able to take on the job of ""doctor"" in clinic until you hold a medical license. You can't give nurses med orders, you can't legally make diagnoses, you can't discuss prognosis or counsel owners, etc until you have the appropriate license to do so. Thus the title Dr. and the degree DVM mean slightly different things. There are DVMs who don't hold medical licenses that actually shouldn't be called doctor in clinic for example, as that is confusing to others, as much as y'all think it's devaluing to the degree.But you have a license somewhere, which means something. If that non-practicing unlicensed DVM walked into your clinic, would you want your techs/nurses asking them for medical orders? To make diagnoses?


Licenses are transferrable. Experience and practice with a medical license makes you a doctor. In a hospital, the job of doctor should be reserved for those who can guide owners/patients towards medical decisions. Job and title are not the same thing. Sure, PhDs call themselves doctor all they want in shops, pubs etc but not in hospitals and clinics.MVB, BVMS and BVetMed are veterinary degrees from AVMA accredited UK vet colleges, none of them have doctor in the title and they are all specifically undergraduate or master's degrees. People will never ever understand academic degree titles and I don't think we should expect them to. Does it really matter whether or not they understand our specific training pathways as long as they understand the qualification? They also don't understand the difference between human nursing, medical, osteopathic medical, dental, optometric and podiatric degrees although all of those professions can diagnose, prescribe and/or perform surgery to some extent (nursing as nurse practitioners). It feels to me like the only reason to try to force people to understand the training pathway analogy is to soothe the ego. It doesn't take anything away from you or I as vets if Joe blow, owner of princess, thinks our degree was 2 years instead of 4. They can take the care or leave it until they educate themselves and figure out not to prejudge professionals.
Also I should point out that although it has doctor in the title, DVMs are undergraduate medical degrees. They are just second-entry undergraduate programs.I think you're drinking the Kool aid a little bit here. DVMs are undergraduate level medicine courses even in the US. It has nothing to do with whether you've completed ""doctorate level coursework"" or not. It's got to do with whether you've qualified for a medical license by completing an AVMA accredited course. DVM is just a fancy flourish of letters to increase Americans sense of self-importance. It's an accomplishment to get one obviously, but it doesn't qualify you to practice the job of being a doctor. It qualifies you to get a license which allows you to practice the job of doctor.


Tbh my undergrad coursework was more rigorous and detailed than lots of my vet med course work.this is an issue commonly discussed in human medicine but the principle applies here as well. do you think a nurse with a PhD in nursing should introduce themselves as Dr. xyz to patients? how about a pharmacist with a PharmD? DPT physiotherapist?

what about MVBs, or BVetMeds? do they not get to call themselves doctor? there's no doctor in their veterinary degree title. RVTs who also have a research doctorate? do they get to introduce themselves as Dr. soandso to owners?

your ability to fulfill a ROLE or JOB in a hospital is what makes you a doctor to the general public, not your degree title. youre conflating honorary titles of doctor in the social domain with the job of doctor in a hospital when they are separate things.

yes obviously licensure in one state does not automatically hold bearing in any other state. once you have obtained the general substrates for a license (a veterinary degree, NAVLE completion in north america) you can complete locally specific substrates and apply for licenses with ease. in that sense, having a license in one place makes you roughly eligible to apply for licensure in another, especially when other boards request letters of good standing etc.You're allowed to hate it. I couldn't possibly take myself so seriously. I suppose if you're working hard people will always recognize that before what's embroidered on your coat.Correct, that's my entire point. A doctor can be a social title or it can be a job but for some people it's not both. For vets and MDs we are called doctor in the hospital because of our medical license rather than our doctoral degree.
To be even more confusing, nurses can have research phds or DNPs which often qualify them as nurse practicioners.Depends how hard you work in RVT school. I'd be willing to bet if a dedicated and focused student did a bachelor's program in vet technology, they could make their life a hell of a lot easier in vet school.Your ability to do well in an MMI has very little to do with your ability to speak with clients.If you think it's condescending to acknowledge someone's feelings the class is absolutely targeted specifically at you.Who cares about how respected a degree is? If that's your rationale for getting one or the other and you hate the job in the end, you're going to have wasted hundreds of thousands of dollars. You should get the degree that allows you to do the work you want to do because YOU respect it, not because other people doEverybody says they can't see themselves doing anything else but I find it's often simply because they don't actually know what jobs look like. You're attracted to this funny, inaccurate but idealized imagination of what being a vet is, but you should go and get some work experience in various fields to help you decide.There's so much more to the challenges of this profession but that's a start.So your first reason for regretting being in vet med is something you have total control over? Get a new job if you don't get along with your coworkers.
Also letting people get under your skin gives them the greatest power over you. Get someone to help you manage difficult interactions. They literally don't have to ruin your day.You sound salty. There is definitely a distinct advantage to having a solid knowledge base built on memorization of useful facts about medicine. Yes if you know how to problem solve and find information you can get there despite a weak knowledge base but having the memorization component gets you through the problem solving faster. Navle success obviously isn't the sole predictor of success as a vet but knowing things helps immensely instead of having to look them up constantly.How else do you address a fundamental knowledge licensing exam to an entire profession with so many diverse end points? How else do you justify allowing vets to literally switch focuses at the drop of a hat? No, not every vet is going to be omniscient, but do you instead want to change licensing to be segregated by species? How do you ensure that vets have adequate training and knowledge to work with the species they about to operate on or prescribe meds to? I guarantee schools can't prepare us adequately and I do agree fundamentally that board licensing exams can be problematic, but there are some really questionable vets out there with licenses. What do you do instead?specialization already exists. examples include surgery, anaesthesia, medicine, large animal medicine, oncology, opthalmology, general practice. we don't expect all vets to do all of these things expertly. i dont think you need to be omniscient or expert in all of these fields to pass the navle. you do have to have an understanding of vet med and be ready to enter any of these fields though.I hope you don't talk to everybody in your life with so much derision. Obviously we aren't expected to be competent at everything after four years. Yes I agree that the standard of training in this profession is mediocre at times. I don't think it has to do with the navleGrossed over 1mill as in you billed over 1mill for the practice?Texas doesn't have an income tax does it?I didn't become a vet because of a love of animals. Such an unfortunate cliche.I think you should reflect on whether you actually feel hate for this person or whether it's something else that you're labelling as hate incorrectly. When we overuse the word hate to describe our feelings it probably makes us more negative. Better to stop and see if you're actually feeling resentment, insecurity, jealousy. Those are easier feelings to understand and move past than just hate.You think vet med is far less important than software engineering? The science that much of our world today is built on? One of the most rapidly developing industries worldwide? I think you're confused.typo, i meant to say far more important. my comment still stands. i think you vastly overestimate the importance of vets to your average individual. animal health care has always and will always take a back seat to many other things. if you wanted a ""fair"" salary as a ""doctor"" you should've gone to med school. having a doctoral degree means virtually nothing. people don't pay you millions of dollars just because your degree has the word doctor in it.LOL you're funnyThen you must already understand that academic doctors don't have the same earning potential as medical doctors and it's essentially because of variability in demand for their distinct skill sets as well as the mechanisms through which procedural physicians bill for their services. Human health care is an inevitable expense so MDs will always have protected incomes. It's easy then to understand why vets will never be paid the same as human doctors, and if we were people would frankly just avoid seeking care for their animalsIf you went into vet med just so people would have to call you doctor you chose the wrong profession. Vet med is a first entry degree in several countries, completed in 5-6 years of undergraduate work. Let's be honest, most people's undergrad was a four year lesson in how to study and be professional. Most people don't carry content forward from their undergrad which helps them practice medicine.Vet med is absolutely doable if you are willing to develop your own interpersonal skills and resilience. There is definitely tons of abuse in the profession but if you can make it through whatever is thrown at you in vet school you start to set your own rules when you graduate. Once you're licensed you are absolutely in control and the field doesn't have to be a hell hole. It just tends to chew up people who don't develop their constitution on the way.No unfortunately ethical teaching is mostly wasted on vets.Because nobody actually follows the teaching, utilizes ethical frameworks, makes consistently balanced decisions, or acts in an ethical way. Tons of my classmates behave unethically all the time and they have it freshest in their minds. People just come to their knee jerk conclusion and defend why they consider their decision to be ethical. The righteous mind by Jonathan haidt provides some very good insight into this phenomenon.a very gentle but incorrect attempt to analyze my perception. no, these are genuinely unethical decisions, its not a difference of ethical values. im fine with people having different personal ethics to me as long as there is no direct or indirect harm to others. my initial post was obviously hyperbole. many vets do ethical things. my criticism is that they often do it intuitively rather than rationally, and vet students can learn ethical frameworks but act hypocritically in spite of this, or fail to apply them to their own actions.God that's horrific advice. I agree on sticking it out but definitely don't handle rotations like thatI'm struggling to remember anatomy and parasites as well, and I've been at the top of my class for three years. I wouldn't fuss too much, just do your best, get it done with and decide what you want to do once your life has settled down a bit. I'm not typically a sunk cost fallacy type of person but you've invested so much already and this degree opens so many doors for you, just do your best while maintaining your sanity.1/3 of vets and owners also think that placebo improves osteoarthritis so let's remember our cognitive biases in reassessing these animals.SedationDont get a MacBook, they charge literally hundreds to thousands more for the same components as a PC. You're literally just paying for the name. It makes zero sense as a student.They hold their value because of their brand and consistency in structural manufacture. Sure there are PCs that degenerate quickly but there are tons of PC manufacturers that make machines which retain processing speed and structural integrity over equally long periods of time. PC is still far better value, especially for a student.It's because you have poor teachers who aren't taking the time to correct your approach.I'm not at Bristol but I'm also a mature Canadian who attends vet school in the UK and I've spoken to a Bristol student, it sounds like a well run program.They make efforts to ensure the courses are all standardized but I would definitely have preferred Bristol or any other school over RVCMost animal products and byproducts are associated with some degree of harm, death is probably the least deplorable form of animal suffering to be honest. I don't know why people fixate so much on animal slaughter when most of it is aimed to be done humanely. It's the other harms associated with farming that I find more shocking, like lameness, mastitis, untreated infection and nutritional disease. If we're going to use animals for food the absolute least we can do is provide them with solid quality of life while we have them alive.Organic food is a marketing scam to begin with and yeah I'll bet it has serious welfare implications. I've not spent time on an organic farm and I probably won't ever as I don't intend to practice on farm animals but it's not surprising at all.Best to pick a school that is avma accredited and teaches in your first language. Also be aware that UK schools and some other vet programs in English speaking countries do not award DVMs, but an equivalent typically at the bachelor's level. Lots of north American students at my school refer to themselves incorrectly as DVM students but if the label really matters to you then you should consider attending a north American school instead.Sounds super passive aggressive and unnecessary. Imagine spending all that time trying to covertly convince other people that you're right and they're wrong instead of just directly addressing concerns as they come up.I started at 29 and I'm far from the oldest in my classMasters degrees do nothing for you as an Ontario applicant unless you are extremely productive in publishing. OVC is exceptionally difficult to get admitted to and not somewhere to hang your hat on.Canadian schools are impractical for most students to apply to.No Canadian bank will give you enough money on a student line of credit to attend international schools.Nobody can get into in province schools. There are SO many students wanting to pursue the profession, enough to easily fix the vet shortage. They just can't get accepted in province. The system is actually completely broken. I got rejected from OVC three cycles in a row, now I just don't feel motivated to return after having to go internationally for my education. Ontario would have to pay me the difference in my tuition for me to return home at this point. Instead OVC has created 20 rural seats with Lakehead for students to try and lie their way into just to get admitted.Nobody posting on Reddit asking about international vet schools can get into Canadian schools.You need to apply for AVMA accredited schools to write the navle and work in Canada. Eaeve accreditation doesnt qualify you for a Canadian license as far as I know, without doing lots of additional, expensive licensing examsOVC won't even interview students with less than a 90% average these days, despite their grade cutoff being 75%. The admissions process is a black box and we have no way to get help with improving our odds of admission, the school refuses to discuss these things. Students also seem to have a distinct advantage having gone to Guelph so in my experience if you went to any other university the odds were stacked against you.Yep, I'm just saying the federal and provincial loans are not even close to enough to be able to pay tuition let alone afford the education. You essentially need to have wealthy parents to attend international vet school.this is absolutely true, i know many of them from my vet program, but they are typically not canadians. the reality is that most canadian vet med applicants know of nothing outside of their provincial program. they all try really hard to get in and some don't even learn about international schools until their first or second rejection. the only students going to these international schools right away without a thought are the ones with independently wealthy parents with connections. most students who end up going internationally have tried in province several times already and are only going as a last resort.OVC may not specifically select for guelph students but there is a guelph advantage in being in close proximity to the FVC, getting advice from vet student friends, having easy access to the limited feedback the school offers. i applied for years to OVC, got rejected with no explanation every year. strong candidate on paper, fantastic references from vets, human medical professionals, so much support from all of my colleagues, extracurriculars and strong work experiences. ill never know what they wanted me to say or not say, or what i got rejected for. all i know is i wasted three years of my life waiting for that school when i could be in internships right now. i am nothing special, and there are many extremely competent students in the exact same position that i was in, some of them are my classmates now.No it won't as long as the school is AVMA accredited and you satisfy the other qualities and qualifications these programs are looking for. Just for your info if you're planning to attend school in the UK and it's even within the realm of possibility that you might want to pursue training here, UK internships won't even generally consider vets without 1-2+ years of GP experience.Pay in the UK is extremely poor for new grads compared to Canada and the US. I would go elsewhere if I were you. Stay in north America if possible.Sounds shady AF.Work on your interpersonal skills and bring it up with management. It's not your place to manage this person, you're only responsible for your own reactions and responses to rudeness.Sounds like toxic management. If this is an ongoing thing they need to be involved. Trying direct interpersonal management yourself is fine for the first time or two but it's not your job to discipline other employees. I personally would be telling my management I'll be finding a better workplace if it's really intolerable. That's not on you at all.Probably not every program has a policy like that but it doesn't sound totally unreasonable. You need to be competent in many disciplines as a vet.Your legs will adapt to the standing but it's an active job and will tire you out most days anyway. Try to make sure you aren't just standing still, if you dont need to be perfectly still try to shift your weight between your feet and push up on your tip toes periodically to prevent blood stasis through muscle pump action.Grades definitely matter to some extent but they're not the sole determinant of the quality of your practice. You have all your life to refine your knowledge and some people are poor test takers. You definitely have to have an understanding of the material to potentially score well on tests but you don't have to score well on tests to necessarily have a strong understanding of the material.
The other option to consider is that you're actually overestimating your understanding of the content. Test results aren't everything but they do tell you something about what you know.I loved anatomy, physiology and pharmacology in my undergrad and wanted to be an MD but didn't want to go through all the silly games and hoop jumping to be given the opportunity to apply. Vet med was more attainable.I definitely think you'd struggle to say there's no correlation at all. It's not the only determining factor but vets that have a broader knowledge base definitely have the potential to be better vetsCorrect, read my other post. There is still a correlation, because you have to know things to be a vet at all and really good vets know a lot of things. Obviously there are outliers when it comes to test performance but you can't say there's NO correlation, just that it's not a perfect correlation.Yeah the system is definitely broken. Vet admissions are such a horrific gameshow of just making yourself fit into a perfect little box.

If it makes you feel any better, I got into a UK vet school and it's intensely underwhelming to me anyway. Would've definitely rather stayed in Canada or the US. I've been trying to transfer since I started.That's because RVC already admits far more students than they have the resources to support. The graduating class is the largest in the world by a long shot.It's aberystwyth students not Harper Keele, but you're right. It's overpopulated and they just keep stuffing more and more students into a single year. I can't stand itI can't wait to get out. Feels like such a waste of my money.If you're training in the UK this is expected. In the US or Canada, almost frowned on but not at all impossibleWish I knew before coming here to study. I'm absolutely not waiting to see gp before an internship. I'm too old for that. Guess I'll have to go back to north America again before returning to the UK.Don't become a vet if it's only because you love animals. Volunteer at a shelter or rescue if that's what you want. Become a vet because you find medicine fascinating and love helping people solve problems.The only way to remedy that is to practice and ask for graded (incremental) opportunities.You can definitely teach empathy, it's a skill just like any other. What you can't do is make someone with shitty behavior realize they are they issue, they have to figure that one out.Probably to states with better protection of women's healthcare rights and access, seeing as how so much of our workforce is women","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian: This comment was written by a medical professional, but it is not clear whether they are a Medical Doctor or a Veterin",Medical Doctor

FK8IT,"$75,000In New Zealand that is good pay.
Just 2 years ago we used to be on average $58,000 salary for new grads... So we're happy with how things are at the moment.I'm not sure if this comment will be seen, but as a recent grad myself (1+ years now), I've found myself quite anxious for the first couple of months (the fear of potentially misdiagnosing/ mucking up surgery) - and it will happen. Not just due to poor knowledge/ execution of a consult but because owners are limited on how much they can cover for diagnostics.

However, there are a couple of things that I have learned that come in handy with every consult.

1. Do not be shy to send for referral/ samples to labs - They will often send you clinical notes about the referral case so that you can learn for next time when presented with a similar case.

2. Familiarise yourself with the drugs you have at the clinic - (you don't have to memorise every drug in your university notes!)

3. Join a clinic that is willing to help - there will be a few hiccups but staff/ clients are often understanding of new grads and the anxiety we feel

4. Go over previous consults on your system that other vets have done at the clinic - this is crucial to get a handle on how things run at the clinic.

5. Go over notes on common cases such as vaccines, skin consults and gastro cases and there will always be a vet you can ask for help.

6. Get Balckwells 5 minute consults/ VIN - Both are awesome sources

7. Enjoy it! Think of all the effort you've put in to get here. For me working is completely different from just relaying information from uni. Keep things simple and keep NSAIDs and Antibiotics by your side as they are epic drugs :)","Veterinarian.

murkyscientist4,"So many people are going to tell you not to bc of the difficulty or the money or whatever their opinion is. If it feels right for you, go for it! Step into the fear, the unknown! What is the worst that happens? You go back into your old career or find something else if you hate it? At least you won’t have the regret of never knowing. And I’m sure you’ll learn a ton about yourself along the way! Plus, time just keeps going so why not apply yourself to something that you think will be more fulfilling? All we have is time really. I get bored so continually doing something new is my jam. 

Anyways, I say this, because you are me. I started vet school at 31 and will graduate this year at 35. I’m going into an internship after graduation and hopefully onto residency after that! Absolutely meant to be and so glad I jumped off the cliff and went for it.

You won’t need to complete another undergraduate degree but certain pre-requisites to apply. Go here: https://www.aavmc.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/VMCAS_2025_ApplicantGuide.pdf

VMCAS is where you apply and all the information should be in there that you need. You should be able to make a login and browse things through there or just go to the general website. You could also look up specific school requirements online or meet with an advisor at a local college or your previous Alma mater and get some advice on where to start. You’ll need things like chem 1 and 2, orgo, calculus, so I’m sure you’ll have some done already.  While you are working on pre-requisites try to get some experience such as vet assistant work somewhere. You’ll definitely need some experience in order to get in but this being a second career you also have other life and leadership experience that other applicants don’t have. You can also apply to an island school which are probably a little bit easier to get in. More cost, but absolutely amazing experience overall. Absolutely loved living in the Caribbean! I’m the adventurous type though. Best of luck to you! How exciting! You got this 👊🏼Following! I have also applied to match and am wondering similar things.

what site should I use to swap matic for myst? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/s32gat/riskfree_staking_earning_launching_mysterium/hsia3ku/  Going through the steps and I am having trouble with quickswap. I see articles that say MYST is on there, but clicking those urls sends me to quickswap with an error. In quickswap if I search for MYST it doesnt come up.

I should note that obviously I was able to swap MATIC for MYST to get my node running, but doing so gave me that warning ""any one can create a token"".

What am I missing? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/rezkjb/how_to_withdraw_reasonably/hpxcme9/  Sorry Mike, I meant I was able to go from matic to myst with the warning, but trying to go from myst to matic, the myst token isnt on quickswap. 

If I follow the link from the mysterium article that says its now on quickswap, I get ""ipfs resolve -r /ipns/info.quickswap.exchange/pair/0x7E2eaA9514C7A56b4D556ff0D1009Cb9C7F2B89D: no link named ""pair"" under QmXfSJfcwmvJEfjrG817Vd7hj8FGC4FPUEeNLokyyYm1tb"" ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/rezkjb/how_to_withdraw_reasonably/hpxjf0e/  Ok, I think I fixed it.

Then while my metamask wallet is connected it sees my coins and gives me the option to swap it for matic. 

I did some searches on the pair value that is in the quickswap error and I saw successful transactions, but they were like 17 days ago. so dont know if quickswap is having a problem in recognizing it, but it looks like it will work with the above steps.

figured I would share it for someone who finds this thread in the future.

purple_house,"Enjoy Blacksburg as much as you can.  It is beautiful - great hiking around there.  If you don’t want to travel far for an externship, check out Companion Animal Clinic in Blacksburg.As far as software: check out Clinic HQ - I believe they have special pricing for non profits.  
I used to work at a HVHQSN nonprofit clinic and a nonprofit shelter and that is what we used at both practices.

The nonprofit I used to work for had a hard time figured out how they would easily know who needed financial help and who was taking advantage and could afford to pay full prices elsewhere.  I know they have applications for financial aide, but since I am a vet and was doing the surgeries, I am not totally sure what the applications entailed.  I also remember the executive director talking about something more simple that if they had a WIC card or medicaid then they could get discounted services - not sure how that panned out.I am a veterinarian at a GP clinic 4 days a week and then have my own business/side hustle doing house call euth.  I love the house call euth so much more than regular GP work.  Personally I have zero issue with emotional people and euthanasias and am fine doing many in one day.  My dream is to eventually do only house call euth, and I think my business has really started to take off lately so hopefully I will be able to do that soon.  I think you could do house call euth straight out of vet school.  I strongly suggest the Companion Animal Euthanasia Training Academy course.  Yes not all euthanasias go smoothly, but the CAETA course is great for knowing what to do do in those situations and once you do a bunch of them you will be much better at handling unexpected things.  It is true that you have to do everything in front of the client, but when I work GP, I also do everything I can in front of the client too - so they know the value of my work and because studies have shown that the animal is less stressed when they stay with their owners.  For me, house call euth is so much less stressful and easier than GP.  Less paperwork and records, less client communication and follow up etc etc. In my opinion SA GP is my least favorite job in vet med.  I have worked as a shelter vet and high volume spay/neuter and really liked that, but right now I need more money and GP is best way to do that.  I think there is nothing wrong with doing what you want to do for your own reasons and not worrying about other people’s opinions.Also I want to add that euth in a clinic sucks compared to house call euth.  Animals in their own home are so much more relaxed with less sympathetic tone, so the drugs work better and more consistently at home.  Also I absolutely hate it when animals are taken away from owners to the back for catheter placement without sedating first and then taken back to the room with a catheter so the vet can euthanize in front of the owner.  So many times the animals are scared, struggling and stressed during that catheter placement, and often it seems to me like we are torturing them before killing them when we do things this way.  Sedating first and then catheter when unconscious in front of the owner is so much kinder, easier and better for animal welfare in my opinion.  I tend to use a butterfly catheter for dogs and fully anesthetize cats and then do renal stick.Female, medical director at a South East, rural, 4 doctor, GP practice.  4 days a week.  $142K base with 22% production.  20 days PTO, 5 days paid off and $2500 for CE.

PitifulJeweler8830,"Sounds exactly like Alliance Animal Health 😂If your dream is to be a veterinarian and you’re passionate about vet med you’re going to get a rude awakening coming to the us and signing your life away to a corporation. Just so you’re not disillusioned. I’d recommend researching what private equity and corporate med has done to the veterinary field in the us, read the stories about staff that have worked for these corps (qol, job satisfaction) and make sure that’s what you want. You’ll be able to get to the us and probably get paid pretty good so if that’s your goal fine, but most vets that go corporate are very unhappy with their careers and the way corporations structure their contracts it can be difficult to get out once you’re in.imo the most important part of any mentorship plan would be making sure the clinic is willing to put it into your contract. Clinics are so desperate right now any job posting you look at is going to tell you everything you want to hear. And looking at posting from clinics I’ve worked at in the past, outright lie. The clinic I took my first job out of school at raved about how close they all were (3 sister clinics, all about a half hour apart) and that the doctors loved to mentor, I’d always have another Sr. Dr. on staff, etc. Well after a month they threw me into a clinic on my own with new grad techs and had me working like 80 hr weeks being on call, no one had time to mentor. Learned about every surgery I know from youtube videos. I’ve since moved on, it was an experience that made me really grow as a dr. due to my learning style but I know another knew grad they did the same thing to ended up quitting and leaving the field entirely. I still see their job postings to this day and it grinds my gears, all their mentorship talk. You want to make sure there is going to be a mentor actually on site, they they will have time for you and you will have time for them, they the clinic won’t have you so bogged down in appts that you can’t get help, maybe have a list of case types/surgery types  you know you want to collaborate on before handling on your own. Unfortunately I got no mentorship so probably not the best to tell you what to look for but I can tell you what not to look for…and to make sure anything you want is in your contract. 🙃EzyVet 100%, by far the best management software I’ve used.I would recommend looking for a new job. Corporations are destroying vet med. My clinic was bought out a couple years ago and it’s been hell. We’ve turned over most of our support staff (probably multiple times) and lost every doctor (we had 7 at time of acquisition) aside from me and one other and I recently put in my notice. We started getting the cheapest materials, we are constantly out of stock of items because they hive you these budgets that make no sense and want inventory as low as humanly possible. They said they had this great hiring team and they would be able to get all these doctors and it was all a lie. No one on corporate management has any background in vet med, just business. At least with our corporation (Alliance). It’s just been an all around shitty experience that has resulted in decreased quality of care, worse management, and higher turnover. At the end of the day all a corporation cares about is $$$$. I think it’s time vet professions start refusing to work for these places, quitting if they a acquire your  practice, and just shutting them out. I’m legitimately scares for the profession’s future if we don’t.Just to add to that over covid fast food restaurants in town were hiring for more than my techs were getting paid, I talked to management to try and get them paid more fairly and was told straight up they don’t care about support staff, they don’t want to increase their payroll expenses. We have a tech school nearby so they can always get new grads. They just don’t get it when I try and explain how valuable some of my experienced techs are. I asked for an additional week of pto (I’ve been there nearly 5 years) and was told by the regional manager that “she’s trying to run a business here and needs me working as much as possible.” They recently were trying to refuse to let me take pto which I have because it was a week another doctor was off - my contract explicitly states  I can take pto whenever as long as I give adequate notice (which I did). I had to threaten legal action just to take my pto. Also (kind of the straw that broke the camel’s back so to speak) I had been told I was getting an increase to my production pay, no other changes to my contract were discussed. When they gave me the new agreement to sign I read it over and they completely re-wrote my non-compete! Fortunately I was smart enough to thoroughly read before signing. Previously it had been that I can’t work within 15 miles of my singular clinic for 1 year. They changed it to I couldn’t work within 20 miles of any Alliance owned clinic for 2 years meaning I would have to leave my county (they were starting to catch the hint I was getting fed up with their bs so offered me more $ but were trying to trap me). I called them out and they played dumb like it “accidentally got changed.” They had the director of HR calling me on a Sunday to talk about and try to smooth things over so clearly wasn’t an accident - they were caught red handed.That’s their tactic. They initially come in and say “everything will be better”, increase pay a bit to get everyone excited, then before you know it you’re in a living hell. Don’t be oblivious - I’ve never heard of anyone having a fulfilling career in corporate med unless they just care about money and not medicine and don’t mind having their soul sucked out of them.My salary has doubled (vet) since the corporate take-over and I’m still quitting. It’s not about money, it’s corporations ruining the quality  of medicine in the name of profit and running support staff into the ground. They think just throwing money at a problem fixes it. At this point I’d take a salary cut to be doing the right thing for the profession.","Veterinarian.

This is a huge project that is still in its infancy, and they have said multiple times that they plan on releasing their alpha for a select few by the end of January. Plus they are still hiring more people to the team.

The crash right now is just everyone freaking out because it's not going to be on Bittrex and nobody wants to use the other unreliable markets to trade it.

As soon as MYST gets listed on Binance or back onto Bittrex the price is going to shoot back up.

Although this can all only happen if the devs actually follow through with their promises. 

I'm still going to HODL, but I got in a while ago when it was sub $0.70 so really I'm still making a profit right now with the price at $1.45 which is fine for me.

Dry-Cartographer7591,"A couple of guidelines I have been taught are: 

•Basically you want to show your interest by researching each school’s program, finding out what you can, and asking about what interests you, what concerns you might have, what might make that school a better opportunity or a better fit for you than another.
—I’ll give the caveat that with the way LSU SVM’s website was set up when I was preparing to interview, my digging was not very fruitful

•Keep in mind that the interview isn’t just for them to shore up their interest in you but also for you to shore up your interest in that program: Is this a place you want to spend 4 grueling years of your life? Are the clinicians there people you want to work with and learn from?

•In general—at least I’ve been told that—they generally have a pretty good idea of who they want to admit before the interviews; so as long as you don’t say anything too outlandish, it probably won’t hurt your odds of being admittedI am an LSU grad (c/o 2021) and would be happy to answer specific questions you might have about LSU in particularAny in western NC?","Medical Doctor or Other.

RaiseKnown2428,"What you said about it’s not a matter of if but when  about the death of a pet is really such a helpful and healthy perspective. Thank you.Thank you for sharing, I struggle with forgiving myself as it relates to my own dog getting bf stuck in the spiral of what I could have done differently. The hindsight is the toughest part, but I am hoping that overcoming that will be a good lesson as a vet to slow down and make intentional decisions that truly feel best at the moment, knowing mistakes get made. I really appreciate the advice of forgiving yourself.Thank you for saying that - it was truly horrible to see her change like that. She was a great dog. I regret making the decision in the heat of a traumatic moment, but my vet and family were clear headed and told me it was the right thing. I hope so. 

But you are so right about feeling it and learning from it, and you certainly save more than not, and even those that weren’t, intentions were always good.Thank you so much for sharing your experience, I truly appreciate it and it’s such a good perspective. 

Thank you for saying that about my dog. She was perfect, I couldn’t understand what was happening to her her last few months, especially when it was punctuated by a no aggressive episodes for a few weeks when my vet prescribed fluoxetine to see if that would help, and it did until it didn’t and then everything got so much worse. In hindsight, I see her mentation changes and lethargy and offness I blamed on the fluoxetine, but was probably due to whatever was going on in her head. Time is a cheap MRI means so much to me - I had thought she needed an MRI when everything first began, but my vet advised the outcome wouldn’t change and my family said I’d be insane to do that just to know so I didn’t do it. Then after the final attack, I knew it’d be for me not for her and that felt wrong. It’s been hard now because I wish I had the closure of knowing, but her behavior made it clear something mg was very wrong with her and my vet assures me it was likely something neurological or intracranial that wouldn’t have been fixable.","Veterinarian.

g0thfrvit,"It was definitely the worst financial decision I’ve ever made. I wouldn’t choose it again, based on the debt to income ratio alone. It’s just a fact.It’s the feeling of being quizzed or scrutinized, and also feeling as though they’re judging what I’m using or the protocol I have chosen, and I resent it when it feels like it’s being done by someone who doesn’t really have a place to do that.Agreed. When I get the question it never sounds like it’s just “out of curiosity”. It’s people asking questions that they don’t even know what to do with the information when they get it that puzzles me and makes me wonder why they’re asking or why they want to know.

I have no problem telling someone what drugs I’m using, but okay after I do that what changed for you?lol I didn’t go to Purdue but my vet school was like this. It’s also in like the last 5 of the vet school standings Some places give estimates, some don’t. It’s not that weird. The places that don’t, do so bc they’ve been burned by clients receiving an estimate over the phone in the past. We give a range of cost and say they need to come in for the exam to determine better. The only thing I don’t agree with is the final cost being 3x the estimate. Estimates are such for a reason, but our estimates give a high end and a low end, so owners know what it could *potentially* end up being. But when you’re getting into hundreds of dollars past what someone is expecting, that’s a problem with communication and the person making the estimate.I have mine as Firstname Lastname, DVMI don’t really encounter that issue bc I introduce myself as Dr. Lastname.I’m not saying I’ve never been addressed as my first name, but it’s really rare.Except I hate my first name so I will not be happy to be called Dr. Firstname lolFemale, Texas, $130k straight salary, 4 days/wk +every other Sat 8-12, 10 PTO, 5 sick days, $1500 CE for 5 days.You’ll take it again.

inigomontoyajoke,"Went to Purdue. Some clinicians are good, some are nasty, and same for techs. I bet I know which clinician complained about posture! My first rotation they told me I talked too much and wasn’t serious about vet med (elective rotation). Second rotation they told me I talked too little and was too serious. But ultimately I did get a great education there. Edit: not to say that this is the only way to get a good vet education- it’s not. Also this does not excuse or negate the bad parts. Would have been a lot better if clinics didn’t make me nauseous some rotations 

I wish I could say it’s different in other vet schools but doesn’t seem to be the case. Have a friend who went to Colorado with similar stories :/Honestly most of the senior clinicians were reasonable and helpful. Some of the residents were not great. It was well known that some people would fail a rotation because of a resident. Repeat the rotation, different resident, they would get As (the inconsistency and the judgement based on if someone liked you was frustrating). I had one block where the resident hated me, got a horrible mid block review, and by sheer luck ended up working with a different resident the rest of the block, and got told that I improved so much…
By the same token, there were some nursing staff that were awful to people. There was a lot of favoritism there. Sometimes I probably benefitted from it. Overall I feel that most of the staff there was good, but there were a few that were truly unfair and seemed to have a lot of power in the reviews. I also received very few criticisms of my clinical skills or knowledge. Literally 95% of the negatives they had were about my personality. I think it’s because they felt they had to mention something (it wasn’t just me; a kid a few years ahead of me got told his smile was creepy and another girl was told she was too happy), but I came out of it thinking everyone hated my personality and dreading reviews.

CarefulCommunity7855,"I am finishing my 6th year (Masters degree) in veterinary medicine now, only 4 more exams left! My opinion has changed throughout the years so much, when I stated the school I was young and hopeful I went in clueless of the dedication and discipline that is needed as well as what does it really mean. Throughout the years I have completely switched from wanting to work in a small animal clinic to wanting to work in a lab( scientific institute) with food hygiene and analysis. This switched happend to me on my last year when I realized I really want to have a life besides my work, and working directly with animals in the clinic requires a lot of sacrifice of your personal life. The school it self is difficulty, i spent studying around 4 hours a day after the lectures and during the exams week around 10 hours a day. Most of my exams were oral exams (due to my University rules) so it was difficult. All in all think a lot and hard before jumping into this, love for animals only is not enough for this profession.","Veterinarian.

Zealousideal-Dog-31,"Clients complaining about moneySometimes the clients ask me if their kids should be present or not. I don’t really mind and maybe encourage them to stay as experiencing death is something that everyone needs to go through. But really up to their parents and kids about what they want do to. I explain the process to them and luckily most of my euths are very peaceful. I dont really talk to the kids, just mainly to one or two of the adults. I let the parents handle the aftermath.Do you have a mentor that can scrub in with you a few times? I think that helps a lot of my junior vets. Youtube has quite a few videos available to pick up tricks and tips from. And learn the millers knot. Good luck!Its pretty common to feel like that for a couple years. And you should definitely find a practice that can hold your hand for a little while.  I always make myself available for the junior vets to ask questions and i also scrubs into their first few procedures.  Just keep learning.  After a few years, you’ll probably most days pretty routine and boring which im having trouble with now.Yup. Ear infections, itchy skin, vaccinations. Did a bit of emergency to compensate.If you were to compare vet pay to human gp pay, we make only about 1/4 to 1/3 of what our counterparts make. Vets have the same amount of working hours, stress levels, and burnout rates as the human doctors. So yes, we are underpaid.Probably should mention Im in Australia and looking at Seek. Human GP make about avg 365k to 385k. Vet GP make about avg 100 to 120k.  Keep in mind its also highly variable depending on location and skill set.All the above are very unpaid. But what…. Vets cant say that we’re unpaid.I think my new grad salary in 2013 was like 48k. Same as a maccas worker.Sorry about how you feel about the industry. I think you should probably try to leave your current place earlier citing mental health issues. No point going to a job that makes you sick. 

I have no real suggestions about other career paths for vets. I have heard about being pharma reps or doing govt work. Dont think wildlife or conservations really pay the bills. 

I think having a good mentor early on in career is the best thing for a new grad. If the workplace can’t provide that, they are breaking their contact with you.In small animal practice, most of my euths are very peaceful probably cuz most of them are quite sick and the use of sedatives and anaesthetics. The main sound i hear are the owners grieving which can be distressing for some people.Startup cost probably several
Hundred thousand. You’ll be working your arse off, like 60+ hours per week as its really hard to find an associate. Might take a couple years to start building up your own clientele and breaking even. Selling would be tricky as most vets dont want to own a practice so you’re probably selling to a corporate.Maybe the expectations of the new grad are quite different. It takes another 4 years to produce a human GP fresh out of med school. While a vet straight out of school can be a GP and be expected to perform an ovariohysterectomy and conduct full workups in all sorts of disciplines. But in reality, we be shitty ourselves the first year cause we forgot everything cause of the navle.I had like three back to back spay bleeders when i first started. Then i learned the millers knot and have been lucky since. For every spay/ surgery, im always thinking on how to improve my technique. 

As for the difficult infectious case. Just have to learn on how to navigate these clients. Dont beat yourself up too much.","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it discusses various aspects of veterinary practice, including surg",Veterinarian
shadowofzero,"Amerivet Veterinary Partners. I've been in this game for over 20 years, starting as a kennel assistant and made it to vet school. My whole life i avoided corporate (VCA and Banfield were the major players at my start). eventually I crossed paths with both and got a taste of corporate vs my preferred private practice. Since my start in this game, private is almost all but absorbed by corporate players. Because of the way time has played out for the vet field, most of us got absorbed or chose to go with corporate for the reasons corporate looks attractive. I've always hated corporate veterinary, and have worked for 6 different companies in my tenure, most of which have been mentioned on this thread. I took a chance and chose AmeriVet, new company in the vet world. I've never been happier in my career. Yeah, there's still the corporate chain and rules, but the culture has been built by people who saw what was wrong with the other companies and chose to make a better choice. As a skeptical pessimist, I took a risk and I am glad to be happy with them.Honestly, considering that they are a newer company, they have been growing and getting their shit together faster than I expected. I hired 3 DVMs 6-7 months ago(1 mentor, 2 new grads) and they have been excelling as professionals. The ideals and culture they promote and talk about... They actually follow.

Look, let's be real. Corporate is corporate. They're there to make money, like any other business. Private practice is becoming difficult to sustain in the markets that have been molded post pandemic. There's more financial security with the structure of the model they've created. At the end of the day, it's not that I'm pro-corperate, I'm pro-financial security. I live in a major metropolitan area where the cost of living is high and pet ownership is just as important as having a family. Weighing my options, I thrive in a workplace that has structure and peace of mind when it comes to being able to get paid.

slaterbabe10,"I’ve been a vet receptionist for 18 months. We are front line for ***EVERYTHING***. You have to be a therapist, emotional support, be a walking PDR of vet meds, know what surgery entails, walk owners through recovery, understand RX diets, & the disease processes that require them. Each Dr in the practice will have their own ‘protocols’ & you will be required to cater to them. The phone never stops ringing, the questions never stop coming, & you will never complete a task without being interrupted 28 times. Keep a notebook at all times that you write notes in to refer back to or you’ll leave with nothing completed. ITs everything, everywhere, all at once, all day. You do it all while customer facing & basically working retail. No one particular part is ***hard*** but when doing them all together it’s ***A LOT*** The whole clinic rides on how well you do your job. The undervalued & underpaid comment is spot on.I get it! I wanted to work vet med, too. I do like my job, I just didn’t realize how much it would be. I went in blind. There is no dedicated training program at my clinic (I don’t know about others) so it was sink or swim. Even after 18 months, I still ask so many questions in a day because I’m facing situations/questions I just don’t know. That maybe a question for you to ask- what does training look like there? How long before you’re required to answer phones & deal with client situations-is there material you can study to better prep you.

heloyesthisisdog,"I will also echo that every surgery resident or someone planning on surgical residency that I have met has either completed or planned to complete both a rotating and surgical internship at minimum to be considered, and even surgical internships are extremely competitive and difficult to get into. It is an unfortunate product of being one of the most competitive specialties in veterinary medicine. However, unless you wanted to work in academia afterwards (where acvs diplomates make a salary similar to a regular private practice vet, ~150k at my school), I believe you stand to make enough afterwards to make up for the years of reduced income. 

I initially thought that if I was going to do a residency, surgery interested me the most. However, after seeing how exhausted and burnt out surgical residents/interns are at my school (80+ hour weeks,  constantly on call, or studying for boards) I definitely couldn't put myself through that kind of hell even if I was competitive enough.If you want to be available for your future family, I really don't think that starting a new practice is the best move. The initial start up cost alone would be approaching 1 million. My impression from clinic owners is that they do not own private practices for the free time and quality of life, but rather for the autonomy and as a long term financial investment.I have also thought about this, and did a little bit of searching to see what was available in regards to quantification of radiation exposure in the presence of a patient while wearing lead. I found this interesting paper:

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9851108/

That calculated radiation dose in staff performing chest radiographs on human patients. They came up with a dose of around 0.15uGy for a person one meter away, wearing lead, from a patient getting a chest radiograph.

Annual radiation limits for individuals working with radiation is typically 20mSv per year. If we assume 1Sv≈1Gy, and you are getting somewhere on the order of ~0.15uGy of radiation per radiograph taken, you could in theory take ~130,000 radiographs per year before you would reach this limit. Obviously this is a wildly crude analysis, but hopefully gives some perspective. That being said, radiation exposure is cumulative, and the goal of radiology should always be to have the least exposure possible. Wearing all PPE, not directly exposing yourself to the beam, distancing yourself from the patient when possible, and taking the least amount of images necessary to reach a diagnosis are the ways to minimize your exposure risk (and always wear your badge!).","Veterinarian.

,"[deleted][removed]Can I ask a question about really basic vetmed certification? I’m in an area that has a serious shortage of emergency trained vets, so much so that there’s been a pivot to regular vets not doing emergency triage, and not being able to recognize emergencies. 

Is there a basic certification that’s available so that pet owners can know when it’s time for the ER?I agree with some of the below threads. Pay varies from state and I’ve also found big cities tend to pay more than hospitals in burbs or rural areas. For instance, I’m not certified and as a tech in Boston, MA I make $27/hour but in Chicago, IL I made $23/hour. That being said, I live with my boyfriend and having dual incomes is honestly the only way I can afford to live.

I know moving for a job is a big thing consider but maybe not a bad idea to see what’s out there. I’ve also learned to not be afraid to advocate for yourself. Tell these jobs with the low rates that you’ve gotten more competitive offers (how will they know if you’re lying??) and drive that price up. CVT are a hot commodity and the right hospital is willing to pay you for your expertist!A new technician started a few months ago, and the way they treat her is awful, I’ve caught her crying out back in the kennel area. And I don’t think she’s doing a bad job at all. I’m getting sick of the toxic people.Oh yeah there’s insubordination. I ask them to do something like ice incisions post-surgery and get a bunch of pushback. Because “no one else asks us to do this.” Every week I have to remind them and what seems like such a small, easy task gets attitude.Nope! I never say anything to anyone about cases other vets have seen. I keep my mouth shut. I have seen some of my colleagues do that to each other, so I really keep to myself.Haha I just hate confrontation. The kennel staff have told me that I am the nicest person in the whole building and have thanked me for giving them respect. I just don’t understand being nasty to someone else. I wonder what makes people act that way.Stay the course and follow your dream. 
Perhaps look into exotic/wildlife services you could volunteer with to see if this is a path you might want to specialise in?Promising, but nothing is final until you’ve signed a contract.Did you sign anything or have paperwork from your current job on the pay rise?Ill keep that in mind, appreciate it!Thanks for the tips and the heads upThis very interesting bc he runs the vet student hospital shadowing days- when you're in ur first and second year, you get 4 days each year to shadow a 4th year vet student. Students were told they couldn't leave by the faculty running each rotation, when apparently, the faculty know that we aren't supposed to stay past 6pm. (Most rotations, we get there 7-8am, so we are having 10-11 hour days minimum.) Dr. C is the one who told us to absoutely tell faculty that we can leave at 6pm and it's really sad to me that when he's telling us to stand up for ourselves, that isn't true for the resident programs. Such a bummer bc he's always seemed so nice.

It gives the feeling of ""I struggled thru all this with my residency and did well so yall should too""i'm only speaking for the shadowing rotations we do as 1/2nd years anyways. i've worked with Dr. C for many handling labs and he's always been kind! since his teaching role includes the shadowing program he was the one who told us to leave at 6pm when we shadow 4th years.i'm emergency in california and get paid 21/hr. on that i still wouldnt be able to afford a place alone, would need 2-3 roomates and rent would be 30-40% of my income depending on if ur lucky for a good deal or not....I've decided that I want to study vet science when after I graduate, but I hate that I'll study something that I have near to zero knowledge about. Are there any textbooks that can provide a brief amount of knowledge about vet science? I've found some textbooks online but they all seem its for students who are going to specialize in something. Any help?internships are almost always required and lately most people have had to do 2 :/. you need them for letters of rec from 4 other board certified specialistsAgree with this. More options is not always better. More options is more you don't know and you're trying to weed thru more surface level stuff (in my school you can only do 4 externships so no way you can figure out 10 different places!)How old are you and is there any chance you can wait a year and apply to a state school? Just asking because the expenses to live on the island and travel in addition to tuition. It’s a great school though. Just the island life is expensive.When you get your loans the first thing taken out, before your survival needs like food water and rent, is tuition. So out of the 20k or so you’re left with 5 k to survive on for an entire semester. You can use this to your discretion. I would not take out another loan for vet prep.I used my unsubsidized loan for vetprep. I took out the max approved amount.Wait. I’m talking about vet prep. It’s an online navle study system. Not anything with the school. It’s 700 bucks.I had enough of my own savings to pay for everything other than tuition the first two years. My family paid for tuition the first half. The remainder of vet school I used federal unsubsidized loans. Whatever I was approved for I took out. I did not use any grad plus loans or private loans. My mother paid for my rent the last two years. I had 0 debt from undergradSo total cost of having permission to be in the building and on the vet school roster was 240k with living expenses included. They didn’t teach me anything I didn’t know. I simply paid to become eligible for NAVLE and to be a glorified tech on their floor. I hated school.Whoops. Oh I would never have do a program prior to vet school. Nothing can prepare you for the amount of bullshit they want you to know. It’s just memory games. You don’t learn anything until you start practicing.I hated school. They worked us like slaves in the clinic. Then wasnt able to pass navle because of it. Once i had 5 months to study without working like a slave I was able to pass. I was not a fan of school by any means. I love the profession though outside of academia.Please lemme know to if anyone can recommend any equine vet related stuff maybe ?Even though they count for credits. You will still have to pay the same amount for the next semester. I maxed out my externship credits hoping I would lower my costs the next semester in lesser required electives. NOPE. paid 15k for 10 credits. Fing scam. Use the externships to check out where you wanna work. If you don’t like it…tell them you’re going onto an internship.Love vet med. you can always be learning. You get the puzzles and challenges of medicine without dealing with humans full time. You can always learn more by opening a book and staying sharp. You can always be improving your practices. You can work wherever you want to work. It pays great if you work hard. Love it so much. So glad I just passed navle. Can’t wait to start my career.I don’t let others borrow my instruments. If I do, I don’t leave the room till I get them back. Everything I have was given to me by a mentor or has been through hell with me.I stuck with vet prep. Wasn’t till the third time, that I was out of school not being forced to work in the clinic 80 hours a week making salads for tortoises or soaps for doctors that I had time to actually sleep and study. Also go to a doctor and get ur blood and hormones checked. I found out I was low testosterone and it definitely helped me pass starting TRT. I put off going to the doctor for 6 years total because of vet school. Was just too busy. But vet prep. Try to do the questions in 1 hour blocks on the timed section and then take a 20 min break. Then go back and read all the explanations. If you don’t understand something. Then go to Merck and read about it. That’s what I did.Focus on getting into vet school first. It’s extremely difficult. Then focus on passing the courses. The course load is nothing like you’ll ever experience in ur life. They force 8 years of education down ur throat in 4 years  and then demand you pass a 360 question test on rediculous veterinary knowledge before you can get ur license. While ur on clinics you will see if you like the internship/academia approach. Dont worry about specialties now. Focus on getting in and how the f you’re gonna pay for it.The vet schools are atrocious what they are able to get away with in the US. JUST ABOUT 130k for in state tuition, or 220k for out of state. And that doesn’t include insurance, living expenses, etc.  Every grade is based on one multiple choice test and you have to read the class notes to pass so there’s No point in going to lecture. They force you to be a glorified technician in clinics and work absurd hours because there are no regulations on student labor. During corona they abused the fuck out of us. You just wear a white coat so everyone knows you’re paying to be a slave. Go to wherever is cheapest and study like hell for navle. My school didn’t prepare me for navle. I wish I went to Germany. They just force you to assimilate to their country. Which is reasonable imo. Just difficult while learning medicine and German culture.Atleast on the timer section. Since the test is in April there is not much time to complete the timed and not timed sections.If you are retaking in April. Really focus on practice questions. Especially timed ones. Then read the explanations. It covers the most material and removes the time wasted you will take making guided and study materials. I used vet prep. The third time I competed it to 97 percent. I passed test this time. Maybe use zuku. I also would read a little additional in material on the questions , whether I got wrong or right on Merck veterinary manual.I viewed vet prep not as similar to navle, but as a fun way to learn the material. It was much better to learn and read through the question format than to just read random info all day. Challenging yourself to do well and get questions right was way more fun. What was annoying was reading all the explanations but it really reinforced the information about the species and random facts you may need to know or see.I really want you to pass. Cause waiting till next November sucks so much. It’s what I had to do. Take as many vacation and sick days from school to study. I focused too much on not failing school cause I told myself I could retake the navle for 700 but if I mess up a semester I have to pay 30k plus living expenses for a year repeat.Focus on the power pages and the powerlectures on questions you really don’t get. Like I had to rewatch pig diarrhea and respiratory diseases 10 times. Just to understand 5 percent of it. But I’m pretty sure I got a porcine coronavirus question right because of it.would you be willing to share where/what company? or dm me? super interested in a place where i could rotate between small exotics and emergency/iurgent care!!Code FredNever too late to do what you want to do. You are only on this earth once. Do what you want. Just know vet school is full of hormonal women who aren’t married that think education and a career will fill that hole. It was a miserable time for me as a man. I just kept my mouth shut as much as a could and went home immediately from school. Found the cool guys in the class to hang with. The residents were so fuckin miserable cause they get paid next to nothing and could’ve gone right out into private practice to make tons of money. Just know you need good grades and a tough class cload to prove to you handle the demands of vet school. It is designed so that you cannot work while being vet school. They spread 8 years of education over 4 years and you are taking a new class every few weeks while 4 other classes over lap and end at random times while new ones start. Clinics you need to work against your will and your opinion means nothing and will sometimes even bother the residents if you know more. They take it as a challenge to their authority rather than you caring about the patient and the medicine; because they’re mostly women. But I would do it again. I learned a lot about women and will probably never get married.A lot of ERs do mentorship but you'll need to ask around. 

If you wanna dip ur toe- Modern Animal does some urgent care. I know they do both GP and urgent care so it's a nice mix. No clue about pay logistics etc, but this is appealing for those who wanna do a mix. 

Personally would not recommend an internship! Most ERs don't care about it and have new grad type programs/mentorships that would service you faaaar better in terms of pay, experience, and overall progress. Internships where I am in California are like 70k for 80 hour weeks (including being on call nights, like maybe a week of PTO etc.). You'll probably get really proficent at surgery and very comfortable, but at what cost? New grad vets at the emergency i work at (i'm a tech there, but a vet student as well) start at 125k as new grads. They have mentorship, a schedule for being comfortable/proficent with surgeries etc. You'll get more than enough experience going straight into ER as a new grad role. I know they have something about a variety of different surgeries that needed to be signed off by a more senior doctor (watching a GI surgery, doing a GI surgery etc.)Highly circumstance and location dependent.  You need a lawyer with experience in non-competes to answer these types of questions.  I would not make a potentially huge financial decision such as this based on what other redditors have experienced.I hope someone sues the living hell out of this organization and that they lose the contract for this test for licensing. In no way is it any test of veterinary competence. It is merely only for hazing. Since the previous gen had to take it, so do we and it never changes. I have no idea how unclear questions of communication, seahorse euthanasia, and pig diarrhea have to do with me doing dentals, surgery, and physical exams every day. I had 0 questions on anesthesia, 1 on surgery. And veterinary schools are horrible as well. I never was able to, or taught to extract one tooth during my education. I merely paid to be a glorified technician in a white coat and to show up and be told all my thoughts are wrong because i had too much experience in private practice. Every test was multiple choice and tested no ability other than to regurg random garbage the professor thought were cool.I am so sorry you didn’t pass. I had to take it three times. Passed by razor think margins this time but that all that matters. My advice. Complete vetprep. And the last month, I was only doing questions in 1 hour sections. Maybe 4-5 times a day. But I additionally read every answer explanation after too. I was able to quit my job and move home and study really hard. Beating this rediculous test is all about studying, training for the 7 hour grind, and hopefully getting a test with questions you know you can answer correctly.Only 5 times. For a low price of 700 plus 500 for study materiasIf failed again im getting my CDL and becoming a truck driver. Fuck it. Clearly my education was flawed and didn’t prepare me for what the ICVA deems as medically appropriate knowledge for practice. Like fish euthanasia, chicken feet pathology and llama reproduction.

-I passed. I still don’t like the test. What a waste of time and money. And now I’m behind on my loans already.Someone in my class got like a 750. I wanted to mri her brain. The ability to study against one’s will to that extent. Sheesh.Always 425 and a roll of the dice that you got enough questions right. 3rd time taking this awful garbage pos test. Every year they find a way to make it nothing like vet prep and ask questions that are completely irrelevant.In the real world. Cap the needle, separate the syringe and throw the needle away in the red bin and throw the syringe in the garbage to save on hazmat fees. They weigh the containers and bill. The test answer would be to throw the whole syringe in the red bin, don’t recap it.To take a test that you’re either completely lucky you get questions you know or hopefully you get a score report from someone else that’s passing.Yes get accommodations even if you don’t need the time for the questions. The extra time you get for breaks and to take the second half the next day sounded awesome. For me it didn’t help. Either I knew the answer or I didn’t. Really focus on the epidemiology. Those are freebies if you understand the specificity and sensitivity questions. I would try to complete vet prep and use the timed section the most. Use the non timed questions when you’re just relaxing but take time to do 1hour sections similar to the test. I can’t tell you how much it helped my stamina and to view the test as sections rather than individual questions. It also helps you make quicker decisions on questions you don’t know so you can focus on some questions you can reason out. Just such a bad test. They need to get rid of it.They remove all the bad questions, after the test has been taken. How intelligent right? Rather than making sure the test has fair questions before it is taken…. Genius.Focus on vet school first. It mostly degrades your will to want to stay in academia. It is extremely toxic. If anything, surgery alone is the best speciality because you learn how to fix things and too many vets in the field refuse to do surgery for 1 not having the time, two not being able to charge appropriately, and 3 they can make more money doing rooms. Internal medicine you can teach yourself. Also…the schools rely on radiology to do the ultrasounds where in private practice, if you want to get anything done as an internist, you need to learn how to ultrasound and interpret yourself. So I would get ur DVM. Work for a year. Then go do an ultrasonography course  where they teach you in a group how to scan. Then study internal medicine yourself. Surgery though, you really gotta do the internship residency route. You still don’t have to get boarded. But you will have to publish some bs paper and waste that time. Unless you are able to find a mentor to teach you privately.I wonder whos results they are.I’m surprised how many vets accept a position with negative accrual.  With how many clinics need vets this should be something that can be removed from the system.  Vets have more leverage than employers do right now and it likely will stay that way for a long time.This is called negative accrual, this is not standard in all contracts.  If it is on yours I would suggest negotiating it out or taking a different position.  There are too many open positions around the country to accept negative accrual as a norm in pay structures.  You should be able to enjoy your vacation.AVMA and WSVMA are the typical places jobs are posted in WA to my knowledge.  Some post in other locals but those are the standard places to post.I mean what would really happen if you just left? Tips on getting these jobs without an mph? Yeah I avoided an internship because I figured I would put all the energy and stress the internship would demand of me in studying on my own time in private practice. They do not appear to be like they used to from the vets that inspired me to go to vet school. They graduated in the 80s. The internships and residencies appear to me to be more of working insane hours for insanely low pay. And then when ur done. Where are u supposed to practice at that level. There is a huge tech shortage and no clinics I know of with competent 24/7 care (south Florida).There are a lot of great resources in learn.idexx.com the Idexx learning center if you can access that in India. A lot of continuing education on hematology. I currently use DaySmart (formerly Vetter) and I use multiple tabs all the time so that would be frustrating for me.  I am not enamored with daysmart, but I am not as unhappy as you sound w/Pulse.  I am thinking of merging with a practice that is currently on Pulse and was debating sticking w/Daysmart vs. swapping to their product.  ThanksFirst off, I'm not a vet. Is the $120K the difference in the cost of schooling itself? I think you should think of the following:

* Flights home to see family  / friends. Could cost at least $1K per trip minimum
* Cost of living (food, housing, etc.) will be a lot higher in England than Baton Rouge
* Does becoming a permanent resident or citizen of England mean anything to you? That could be a big positive for the England route
*  Investigate immigration status in England. Sometimes study permits don't allow you to qualify for national health insurance scheme. Might be more $ for a private insurance plan or a school sponsored plan

And many more nuances that come with international moving. With that said, only you can decide if it's worth it. I find it sometimes helps to flip the question: If you were planning to go to England for vet school and someone said ""I'll pay you $120K to go to LSU instead, all else being equal"", would you do it?You are welcome! The opportunity to live abroad might never come back around for you, so if you don't go now, you'll have to be sure you can live with ""what might have been""Hi! Wildlife rehabilitation/rescue has become my life’s passion.

Couple things you have to know
- you want to find GOOD rehab centers to learn from. Well funded and highly professional. Not one where nobody is monitoring volunteers and animals can get killed on accident from carelessness. It’s more than them having a good vet- it’s gotta be the way it’s run
- it is a very very high amount of euthanasia and that’s not for everybody. My brain sees it as a treatment for the untreatable and giving them respect/peace and am grateful for it. But I can’t do pet euthanasias emotionally 🤷🏼‍♀️ everyone’s different
- it’s not rolling in money. A good one will pay decent but you’re not gonna be rich
- you will have to cut open dead rats, bunnies, and other and sometimes break their bones to make portions for raptors and scavengers
- depending on the animal, you can get hurt but if you’re doing ur job right it won’t be severe. Just bites/scratches. It’s only a problem with rabies vectors but idk any professional who’s gotten bit and you have to have the vaccine to be able to work with them
- some days ur gonna get gross, that’s what scrubs are for
- some animals will have parasites on their body and they will often crawl up your arm or you find them a few hours later bc they’re so little. It’s feather lice primarily bc ticks are usually attached and feather lice will fall off in a day or two bc we don’t have feathers but that is the main thing I do not like. Nobody told me and then I found some on my arm or leg and was like “where is this coming from”

Some people can work in education for rehab centers that have resident animals that cannot be released into the wild. This is sometimes controversial but everywhere I’ve worked has had themWish I could say the same as a wildlife specialty 😅😅😭😭 but the joy I get is worth it😂You have SO much time. I completely switched my animal focus and my entire path. Some people go to vet school years after they graduate college. Go get a degree in animal science or zoology IMO. You’re gonna have to deal with mainly not working with animals everyday for undergrad unless you’re working- it will get you to your goal in the long run.That’s what I wish I did instead of a directly vet focused undergrad. Make sure to take ornithology it’s the best! (And hey, you have more of an idea of what you want to do than most high school seniors I promise)I promise you not all places are like this. Please leave, you will find places where you are appreciated <3All the vets/clinics I’ve worked for- amazing and amazing staff or bad and bitchy staff (and more illegal stuff)Atleast with ur DVM you will be able to work rooms in a private practice to make a living. I feel like aquatics is mostly funded by grants and or research funding so I imagine it’s not very conducive to paying the bills. Just my 2cents.Best recommendation I can give you: find a veterinary job that isn’t working face to face with owners/clients. Changed my lifeThis is why we have a vet shortage! Pay for 4 years of vet school just to make 1/5 of a human doctor and be 3x more likely to unalive yourself? System has to changeMidline. Taught in poland, practiced in UK but noone said anything about me going flankI think the people that do this generally do wildlife biology as undergraduate degrees and maybe get an additional master's in wildlife biology first. You will not get ANY training on wildlife in vet school. Being a zoo/exotics/wildlife vet requires you to be a comparative biologist. Take what we know/have for domestics and apply to the species you're working on. A lot of fact finding for papers to get protocols, etc... So having more knowledge of that work prior to your vet school experience will help you. It's a small field and hard to break into. If you're thinking capture and immobilization of let's say bears for research a lot of that is done with PhD's so maybe get in touch with a school that has a wildlife department and talk out best steps. If you're thinking rehabilitation, then you're typically doing that work on the side. If you're thinking zoo then you'll generally need a residency after vet school.I work with wildlife so I don’t have to interact with owner ethics (thank god) but I remember in practice interviews in school they would give us situations like these and ask what we would do- very interesting discussion!Just passed navle here. Took me three tries. I can’t tell u how brutal first and second year were because of anatomy and the lecture load. I felt the same. I would get a D and study harder only to get a C-. Once I realized this is not a test of intelligence, these vet school tests are a test of memory I stopped caring so much and just make it about memory. You have to find ways to memorize shit with mneumonjcs and stuf that your brain wants to remember. Just know it’s there to prepare you for the amount of BS you need to force urself to study for navle. It may have 0 use in the clinic but some people believe it all makes sense by graduation; The anatomy first year, then pathology second year, clinics 3rd year, and electives 4th year with some more clinics.  By the end it all makes sense together. Vet medicine is a monster. Idk where I’d start with teaching. I just wish we didn’t need to focus on all that large animal bs. Such a waste of time. Just with clinics, keep ur mouth shut and pretend ur dumb. Most residents and interns will see you as a challenge to their authority if you make recommendations better than them. Atleast in my experience. What I really really learned from vet school was where to look up information and how to back up what I wanted to do medically with sound medical reasoning.Push you to ur limits of studying random information against ur will. Even Einstein said he found it pointless to memorize random facts you can look up in a book. Test was a huge waste of time I could’ve been helping patients and contributing to vet med.During undergrad, I took a long leave of absence during which I worked at a veterinary clinic as vet assistant for 2 years. I actually returned to school to apply for vet school but I had great success working in lab with publications and scholarship that I'd try grad school. But I now come to realize my true passion is science but in context of helping animals
So this is where I am :(Student loans. Lots of student loans. You can’t work during school. And take the summers off. You’re gonna need it. You don’t need to be smart for vet school. You just need good memory and test taking skills. You do need to be intelligent to be a veterinarian. School was a joke tho. Everything was multiple choice. Not one written exam.Cover as much as you can. But at UF it didn’t seem to matter. The boarded surgeon had a sleeve.   Pretty badass. They just better be sick tattoos. lol. Hopefully they’re not explicit or sexual.Work in as many different vet clinics as possible. Make sure it’s really what you want to do. It is an expensive journey and filled with insane amounts of stress. I wouldn’t have chosen anything else. But getting as much experience will greatly improve the stats you will get accepted to a vet school. You need very good grades and a very high class load to prove you can handle vet school. Look at a schedule of a vet school to see how crazy it is too. You don’t get to pick much. You’re strapped in for the ride taking 5 classes at a time that would take all semester in undergrad but finish only in weeks in vet school.Thank u!Spend a week volunteering with the horses at Best Friends in Utah. They also might have internships available.The two places I work, the techs always ask the docs if we need them to do anything else before they leave. The lead tech can certainly send them home early to avoid OT or whatever, but they still touch base with their docs before leaving.
It’s not so much for permission, though - it’s just making sure the jobs are done. Seems to work well.I am in the unpopular minority that hears what you’re saying about your home life. Obviously it’s ideal to graduate and have this career as an option for a solid income with really flexible hours. I’m a parent of six, homeschooled my kids for 9 years, and have been able to be there for every hockey game, every Shakespeare performance, every riding lesson, every sleepover because I do relief work.
As for things you don’t know and can’t remember? You will learn 90% of what you need to know in practice after you get out of school. The learning NEVER ends.
But your kids. It breaks my heart to hear that your little kids have to be cared for by someone who is angry and scary and mad at them.  This can’t go on.  How can you find a way for your precious kids to be safe and happy, while you can finish school?  This is what you need to focus on.  I would start interviewing nannies or babysitters, and remember that it’s not forever…it’s to get you to the finish line (or really the starting line of opportunity) while keeping your kiddos safe and happy. Again, unpopular opinion here, but  for me personally? I would sacrifice absolutely everything if I didn’t trust that my little ones were safe - both emotionally and physically - while I was away.OP said her husband and his short temper are a big part of the problemIsn’t this really hard for you to track?Agree. I know many disagree with me, but there is no way that our practice of medicine should be influenced by production incentive.Oh that’s good. In my second job, we were salaried with no production incentive, but of course they tracked production. It was fun to compare, and interesting in that all of the ER docs had almost identical production. But then…they changed it so that we couldn’t see our production. 
Down the line when they switched to base plus percentage, it became an issue.Agree. #1 most important thing is that I can practice good, thorough medicine. Not possible with 15 min appointments.The doctor asked me to put meds in a bag of fluids and I just stuck the needle through the side of the bag....I’ve done that🤣We had wall to wall stall mats. About every 2-3 months (as a tech at the time) I would pull them out and clean under them/disinfect both sides. Huge pain in the ass but it was econimical and worked. As a DVM I worked at the same clinic and was fine with the floors. In the stalls we had regular stall mats and they were sealed with a rubber caulk material (I had to reseal them once when I teched there). The other equine clinic I worked at had the same thing but in the year I worked there I never saw anyone pull them and clean underneath...god only knows what was growing under there. 

I have also seen the I would assume spray on grippy rubber stuff at the vet school but I don't know cost wise what that would be. It was a very ugly green color so I assume it was very old but seemed to be holding up. It was only in the exam areas, otherwise textured cement.I currently work in the vet industry and idk where you're pulling those numbers from but none of the vets in the state that I live in make what you are saying. They make a base $55k (if they are lucky) and our hospital just increases their production to 9%. They're also all salaried so even if they pull a 100 hour week (which all my vets do!) They're still only making 40 hour week pay. Our new grads are currently making $15/hr. It's not work ethic that is going down. It's businesses deciding vets shouldn't be paid what they're worth.One of my veterinarians just had a very bad accident and needed multiple surgeries and was out for 2 months. When she got back the first thing our hospital said was ""you owe us $7500 for lost business, we're taking it from your check""

 She had to back out of an apartment that she was moving into because she couldn't afford it now. She's legitimately thinking of quitting the vet industry and working as a waitress because she ""made way more money with less stress""My friend just moved out of Texas because of the current political climate and said she would never go back, so not really gonna believe a stranger on the internet who can't spell correctly. I also have relatives in Texas who are actively searching for a new place so they can move away as well. Any conversation I have had with (sane) people from Texas say to stay away.

As of right now Texas has shown they do not care about women or the LGBT+ community and are more than willing to let them die. And I'm (as well as many others are) not willing to move there on the chance that politicians there decide suddenly to become human beings with souls.Apologies but I don't feel comfortable saying where I live on the internet, but all hospitals in my state are roughly the same.I work for a large emergency hospital. It sees small and large animals alike and we see wildlife as well. We have a doctor shortage because the company doesn't want to pay us what we're worth. We have doctors leaving vet med all together because they don't want to pay us what we're worth.I am not a vet and I make more than our new vets do. I still don't make much, but it's more than them. And I will say that I live in an insanely high COL area. A studio apartment where I'm from can easily be $3k a month.You have no clue what you're talking about, my guy. They're trying to find places that will pay them what they're worth. Idk where you live but where I am that's just not the case. I need you to open your eyes and see that not everyone lives in the same area you do and many people can't afford to move across the country for a better paying job because they can barely afford to live where they are currently. 

My doctors love being veterinarians. They are not leaving out of ignorance, they're leaving because they cannot afford to live and pay off their loans with what is being offered. Or they're offing themselves but that's also tied into not being appreciated and paid what they're worth. My doctors stay at the hospital for days at a time, sleeping/showering/eating here to care for their patients. They get paid their 40 hours a week but are here 100 hours a week, they're not clocking out at 4pm, which you so condescendingly have decided they must be. Get off your high horse, my godThank you so much! It’s actually heartbreaking but I’ll try to find a way through it!They say I had an obligation too as under the university guidelines. The support services wrote a letter to tell them what had happened and they said because of my OT assessment in early July that means none of that applies and I should have been able to study. Yeah because mental health is THAT stable. I don’t think there’s any winning with them. I brought up the equality act on my appeal because my ot officer said I would likely be covered under it. But they don’t careDo you know if this counts for long term mental illness eg anorexia and diagnosed anxiety depression? xI’m in the U.K. The OT report says its covered under the equality act. It’s a long term thing. But I didn’t want to take medical Leave because I thought it would be resolved within 2 weeks.Going forward, make a point to tell clients, in front of your techs, the potential complications of not restricting activity - like hematomas. Quote some stats of how frequently this occurs if the dog is not strictly exercise restricted after surgery.  It might be a bit passive-aggressive, but it’s one way of showing them it was not your fault. It’s a way of teaching the techs that 1) you do have the knowledge and 2) your tech might be more at fault for allowing too much activity too soon.
I often use my conversations with clients as an indirect way to teach my techs. I come from a ER/ICU background, and I do many things differently (and more “purist”) than the other docs at the GP where I work.These happen from activity. Not your surgical technique.Geeeeez!Then the only person she should be frustrated with is herself for assuming a student is good to go and not being there to support and mentor you. Try her suggestion and Grab the pedicle with your forceps. Try that. Don't try to get faster yet, just practice your knot security. If you want to try to speed anything then work on your closure. Take your time with the rest. I personally think it's really silly to be prideful about how fast you can do a spay on regular practice. You should care about the quality of your surgical technique. Speed is for the shelter.I live in Norway and will be enrolling in either Slovakia or Poland, i took a few gap years after vet tech school and worked cause my vet tech diploma isnt worth shit in norway, thats why im trying to become a vet :DThank you so so so much!! This makes me a bit more sure of what im doing!Have you tried a prep program?Hey there... Well its not impossible but it'll require some extra effort if ur looking  to do navle without vet prep... I personally studied initially by making my own notes from a no of sources.. i followed the list of diseases given by ICVA.. after 3 months of doing that i started preparing using Vetprep... since i practiced in a clinic aswell.. the clinical experience also helped.. but i could answer about 80% of those vetprep questions easily i could say.... So you can study for navle  without vetprep but its difficult.. and will require more time... and then there is a chance of not passing navle on the first try... so paying for vetprep is better than paying navle twice... I hope this helps..
 Incase if youd need any help in ur preparation you can hit me up...Kuru sneakers and compression socks. Kuru’s have a cool insole that kind of holds your heel from flattening out with each step. They are not big fat sploshy shoes like Hokas. I run in Hokas but I hate them for work because they are way too wishy-washy. I need something supportive and reactive to my quick movements.Ah! Probably don’t try Kuru Atoms then!They also have more of a neoprene-like material that’s pretty hot, unlike the quantums and flux which are more breathable. I agree, not a fan of the maximalist Hoka feel.I had 4 in 4 days, had 1 day off to get some lab studying before the practical. Pretty intense but not terrible. Actually did great.Speaking as a student we all already have several of those because everyone thinks it's a fun gift, most of them have inaccuracies, and we just don't have time to use them.Way more often than not! 
“What time did he get his meds this morning?
“Oh, I forgot to give it to him.”
“So did he get it last night?”
“No, I forgot. Can we give it to him now?”Yeah, same. “Do you have enough medication or do you need a refill?”
For the cats, I can sometimes make it work depending on the cat. For the lunging dogs, nope.Was working about 60 hrs/week in ER/ICU when I decided it was now or never. I was CRAZY into my job, loved the intensity, the level of medicine, the focus on learning, and the great team I was a part of. But I was 33, knew I wanted more than one kid, and didn’t want to have kids when I was over forty. 
And so it began - the shift from a full throttle ER/ICU vet, to a full throttle mom of five fantastic kids whom I ended up homeschooling for 9 years (7 years before Covid hit.). 
It began with a miscarriage during an overnight shift - fun times - then five babies in a span of 5.5 years (no twins.)
I went back to work after 3 months for the first and second, but worked weird hours (like 6 hour shifts) so that I would spend most of the days with them. After my fifth, I took a year off. 
My two oldest kids, now 21 and 20, were reminiscing recently about how sad they used to be when I went to work, because they felt like they wouldn’t see me again forever. 
One day I came home and found my oldest kid, about 7 at the time, missing an eyebrow. Dad - apparently my sixth child- had bet him $22 that he wouldn’t shave off an eyebrow. He did. Every time I worked, it seemed, stuff would happen.
One day I was just leaning in to intubate an unconscious, cyanotic Pomeranian when I was paged. My husband was calling from the back of an ambulance, on the way to the hospital with my son who was gushing blood out his ear. (Backstory: Apparently he and his brother had been pretending to be dinosaurs by putting Q-tips in their ears, and jumping on the bed. Little guy fell on the bed, on the Q-tip, and of course it ruptured his ear drum and had to be surgically repaired with a graft. But I digress.)
Anyway, while leaning over that blue dog, chanting to my panicking self, “First save the dog. You can’t change the ambulance situation” was the moment I realized I just had to be home. 
I took several years off except for a rare relief shift. When I started back, I had lost 99% of my confidence. It was awful and it was terrifying.
I’m 100% glad I was home with my kids while they were young but it’s almost a miracle that I had the guts to return.
If I had it to do over, I guess I would have made it a point to do like one shift a month.
I started back by doing some vaccine clinics (shhh), then GP relief, then back to ER.  When my youngest got to high school age, I took on more shifts, but I still usually work shorter shifts (9-4, 4-11) because I want to be around for them. I do relief only so that I can schedule work around every one of their hockey games and saxophone performances. I refuse to miss ANYthing they do!
My focus is 100% my kids. No longer my career. Don’t get me wrong - I’m super diligent and thorough with work when I work - but I work because it’s what I do with my time when my kids don’t need me. 
Having a baby will change your career, but there is nothing wrong with that. It doesn’t make it worse, just different. 
Good luck!I wrote a long reply to OP, but want to share my experience with you. I had 5 kids in 5.5 years, and never went back full time. I was (and am) all-in as a parent.
My one regret is that I ended up taking a few years off while I was homeschooling four of my five (long before covid.)  Those homeschooling years were the absolute BEST, but to return to practice after that was terrifying because I had lost all confidence in my ability. If you do take time away, consider doing a relief shift once a month or so, just to keep that door open.I hear ya on all that!  I would not mind if something I was passionate about that paid well landed in my lap!

Go ahead and read through that, buddy.Thank you for your input!! I added some more info to give people more context. I just worry that maybe my good experiences now aren’t reflective of how life would be as an actual practicing vet.I’m currently shadowing at a clinic now!!! I like being a vets assistant and it’s been really informative and helpful so far. 

I genuinely thought I would have to abandon anything tech related for good. While I’m focused on becoming a vet, I have wondered what would come of those skills I spent years working on. Thank you for this tid bit. Genuinely eye opening. 

I’m in the middle of my gap year but when I start school I’ll definitely speak to a counselor about this. I want to book a therapy appointment too just to hear a truly unbiased opinion. 

I feel confident about pursuing this as a career, it’s just the finances that worry me. I’m first gen and don’t come from a lot of money. I’ll be the first one in my family to navigate college in the US. Thank you again for your input and advice. Im so appreciative!!!This is exactly what I needed to hear thank you. I’ll definitely look into this. I didn’t know certain jobs would help with loans. Thank you so much!!!!yes, you should wear gloves. It is a chemical burn. The wipes cause this as well.All the timeI often tell owners from the beginning “This is going to be a work in progress. We’ll go one step at a time, and we will have you come back so we can keep a close eye on him while we chip away at (whatever the problem is.)”1. Pack healthy food for work. Lots of veggies and a protein shake.
2. Pack fun beverages. Infused water, kombucha, a special sparkling water, whatever gives you a little happy dopamine boost. (Doesn’t have to be chocolate!)
3. Weight training takes fat off, big time!
4. Recently I was having motivation problems, partly related to knee surgery and being unable to make progress like I used to. I hired a personal trainer. Part of the reason is to try to correct my deficits. But a bigger part of the reason was I needed someone to report to, someone to hold me accountable!
5. I schedule one shift a week with a later start time - like I’ll start at 11:00, JUST so I can go to the gym BEFORE work, because I have nothing left in the tank after workYou're going to want to update your resume. Going corporate has sucked the soul out of every clinic I know that's sold out, and left the entire staff overworked, underappreciated, and burnt out. 

When my fiance's (tech) clinic went corporate things went downhill fast. A bunch of their best employees went to the office to tell them if something didn't change soon they were all leaving. The corporate solution? Creating a ""head tech"" position with extra responsibility and no pay raise. 2/3 of the employees in that meeting quit within the month.All corporate buyouts are bad. Even if a company is smart enough not to try to fix what isn't broken, everytime a faceless profit-driven entity takes over a small privately owned business the entire community loses. This is not exclusive to veterinary medicine.My fiance got better pay and benefits moving to a private practice after her clinic went corporate. 

Even if there are temporary boons to a select few people, it's not worth the overall harm that corporate takeovers do to the profession, individual clinic cultures, and local communities. 

Corporations are not our friends, and even if they write your check they do not care about you. Don't push their talking points for them.If you leave vet school is it hard to get into another one? (Mental health reasons)The only people that worked in vet school did a Saturday shift as a VA at a vet hospital during the school year. It was maybe only 2-3 people. You should not expect to work. It's more than a full-time job.Vet prep should tell you where you're struggling... Focus there. Also rest, eat well, go outside.At my clinic it was required that two people initial the bottle. So the person filing it would bring the label, the original bottle and the Rx bottle with meds to have someone else check them. Two signatures were checked by the CSR before being given to the client. 

If you're going for an appointment (new prescription), do this with the DVM ... ""Hey doc, can you review this prescription before I go over it with the owner?"" Tell the doctor you're always paranoid you've done it incorrectly so they know why. Initial the bottle. Have them initial the bottle. Always bring the original bottle of medication from the pharmacy with you to check for label and pill matching.

In general:
Right drug, right dose, right route, right time, right patient. Never set anything down without a label (especially injectable). If you're filling two do one completely before opening the next bottle.Their service is overloaded, it can't cope with the demand put on it, making the back end fail all the time, one of their people said as much 2 days agoNo, you're not wasting your time, but I will say your screenshot shows that not a lot of bandwidth being used, and you have only had the node session active for less than 24 hours, so you should really give it more time.

Its not about volume, its about their new policy to try and comply with US securities exchange laws, Bittrex is trying to avoid getting wrecked by the SEC.

They are delisting all coins and tokens that 1. pay dividends or 2. have no use outside of trading.

It appears like bittrex is trying to make sure it is SEC compliant, and delisting things until they can provide documentation proving they are not just unregistered securities.

rhymeswithhannibal,"Current second year student. I was a non-traditional applicant, and decided intentionally to take 3 years off between undergrad and vet school. I worked in a couple different types of practices during that time and volunteered at a local AZA accredited zoo. My main application strategy was to focus on my grades during undergrad (graduated Summa cum laude) and got experience later. I come from a low socioeconomic background, so I wanted to get paid for my experience - taking several gap years was good for me, allowed me to get a bit more settled in life, then attempt school. The transition back to vet school was challenging after being in the workplace. 

Not graduated yet, but yes, vet school ≠ (a majority of) GP practice. A lot of times, we are are taught the gold standard, but this isn't always feasible in the real world.

Sufficient_Daikon_59,"I’m not a vet, but my father is so although I can’t speak on the direct impact, I’ve seen/witnessed it.

It’s definitely an emotionally taxing job, but you already know that. There’s times my dad has come home from work and we won’t really be able to talk to him because he’s upset from something from work, for example, having to witness children’s agony upon learning about their sick pet. 

Other times he will come home with over-the-top gifts from people whose animals he saved.

LetsGoooat,"The formula is M = DWV/kR. The value of k depends on the units used for every other variable.  We're using these:

M = total amount of drug in mg  
D = CRI rate in mcg/kg/min  
W = body weight in kg  
V = total volume in the CRI syringe in mL  
R = rate of delivery in mL/hr

Plugging these units in:

mg = (mcg\*kg\*mL\*hr)/(k\*kg\*min\*mL)

simplify:

mg = (mcg\*hr)/(k\*min)

solve for k:

k = (mcg\*hr)/(mg\*min) = (mcg/mg)\*(hr/min) = 1000\*(1/60) = 16.67

It's very important to recognize the 16.67 only works if you are using exactly these units.  In particular, you need to pay close attention to mg vs mcg and CRI rates that are per hour, per minute, or per day.Are you in the US/Canada?  If so, veterinary school is a graduate degree.  A full ride for undergrad is a great thing to have no matter what field you end up going into, but for vet school you will still end up paying 6 figures in tuition.

If you're outside the US/Canada debt is usually not a major concern, but salaries are going to be much lower.  In that case I would try to get in touch with local vets and ask them.  Really the answer to this question changes a ton depending on what country you're in, and Reddit tends to be pretty North America-centric.","Medical Doctor or Other.

Naamch3,"Imposter syndrome sure seems to hit a greater # of people in this recent crop of college grads. I wonder why? But for your purposes please don’t let it stop you. Most others in a range of graduating years near you had the Covid impact as well. I have two suggestions. #1 pursue your dream vet job and let nothing stop you…especially yourself. You will grow old regretting it. Knowing you gave up on your dream b/c you lacked confidence will gnaw at you forever and could destroy your mental health over time. Once you get your vet job and are treating patients I doubt the vet practice will allow you to be a sole decision maker on critical cases at first. You and they will want to have an experienced voice in both diagnosis then treatment. Also, be open during your interview. Let them know how much you want the job and ask about mentorship.  Like any medical position a credible veterinary practice will want to assess you before they allow you to fly solo. It might help if you interview at larger practices where they might have more mentoring options. Be upfront about your nervousness. They will appreciate it and tell you that it is normal. If you get an offer from a veterinary practice that doesn’t give you the confidence that there will be mentorship as well as various checks to ensure you cause no outlandish harm then just keep interviewing. Please don’t let that voice in your head cause you to take a desk job and god forbid you take a government job. That sounds like a recipe for a lifetime of regret and pain. I don’t know you but I assume you are better than a government job.

Option #2, if you really are paralyzed by your imposter syndrome then what about interviewing for nurse or technician jobs at vet practices? Or vet / doctor assistant? I apologize for not knowing the right vocabulary for these positions. Sure the pay won’t be what you could make as a veterinary doctor but it provides for a slower start and a longer runway to get your feet under you. As for the economics, assuming the ‘nurse’ job builds you into having the confidence to flip to veterinary doctor then the lifetime earnings will far exceed the giving up option of pursuing that banal government desk job.

Hope this was helpful. A rule of thumb I often use is this, you have only two people in this world to make proud of you. Those two people are your eight year old self and your eighty year old self.

BBG1308,"High speed scanners make quick work of this.

It helps if you separate out the actual medical record from other documents such as consent forms so that when you want to look at history, you get nothing but the chart notes. You certainly can and should save all those other documents, but just do it in a separate file.

What's slow is making sure that if you rely on your Cornerstone database to give alerts such as diagnostic codes or allergies or adverse reactions or handling recommendations or existing authorized prescription refills...each record has to be looked at and those things manually entered.

Our DVMs loathe looking at scanned records. Even \~ eight years down line we still have some paper charts because of this. If the patient's chart is more than an inch thick...hard nope on scanning. If the patient is of a certain age...hard nope on scanning. If the patient hasn't been seen in two years...hard nope on scanning.

Your time is more valuable spent generating income for the practice than scanning records. See patients. Deal with paper charts for the ones that are enormous or are likely to pass soonish or may never come back. Pay someone else to scan the rest. You still have to have someone (you or a well-trained tech) to read the record and enter any necessary database info.> I also see many people saying RVT school does not transfer to DVM school in any way.

It doesn't count at all towards a four year graduate degree in veterinary medicine.  But veterinary students usually complete a four year bachelor's degree prior to applying to veterinary school.  

If the RVT program is at an accredited institution such as a community college, some of their credits can be transferred to a four year university and may help them achieve their bachelor's in less than four full years.

RVT school is primarily a vocational program. Thus the ""T"" for technician. They don't diagnose or prescribe.

I've seen so many students get in with minimal hours ""shadowing"" and I think a lot dissatisfaction could be avoided if people had solid experience and saw the way veterinarians are treated. 

A lot of your comments are specific to your school but I do agree that vet school isn't for everyone and what you stated about toxicity. It's certainly not worth it to most. I have not had a fun time in school but I have worked in vet med for a long time and I know I'll be happy in this career, despite its challenges.

Tough_Hedgehog_3211,"Interested in this too…  I personally have some very strong negative feeling about one of my undergrad institutions and actively try to convince people to not go there.I have a doctor in my area that isn’t a native English speaker and he decided partly because of the language barrier and partly because of his enjoyment of surgery to open a spay/neuter clinic.  His clinic offers nothing but that and is only a secondary practice, everything else gets referred back to GP’s.  They’re open 5-6 hours a day in the morning.  My area has like 10 less vet offices than it needs so as of right now most of us are looking at February for spays for example.  He and his techs literally do nothing but spays/neuters and occasionally vaccines.  Very interesting concept if you ask me.  He also offers them low cost because he is a really good guy and also it turns out if you pack your books with surgeries even at low costs you can really make enough money to support yourself.","Veterinarian.

slambiosis,"I have worked in practices that have Idexx, Heska and Zoetis. My current hospital has Zoetis. I definitely prefer Idexx for a few reasons:

 I'm in Canada and Zoetis doesn't have a local rep that can drop in and help with our machines. Every time I had an issue with Idexx, I'd immediately get an email from our rep offering to come in and assist us. Also, the Idexx staff were friendlier than Zoetis staff.

I am unfamiliar with what additional services Zoetis offers. I already know I can get every test I've already looked up from Idexx. I had started doing SDMA in-house in my senior cat years ago and now we have to send it away. I like how Idexx allows you to build your own panels.

I find Vet Connect easier to use than Zoetis Fuse. I'm not sure if you can access your test results outside of the computers that have Fuse bookmarked on it - but you can with Vet Connect.

I am beginning to wonder if our lack of having a local rep may be why we don't know how to use Zoetis efficiently 😆

The Idexx store has a TON of free items that you can order whenever you want - from culture tubes to free blood tubes to shipping materials. It would always arrive within 48 hours of the order being placed.

The HM5 rotors don't require you to spin the blood before you put them in it, which is nice. The boxes take up more room in the fridge compared to Idexx. The first Zoetis clinic I worked at didn't have the pipette for the blood and I messed up a few rotors by introducing too little blood or air bubbles into the sample - word of advice, don't lose that pipette.

The only downside to Idexx is how they're always trying to upsell you a product or service - because of that, some veterinarians don't trust some of their products and services. In my Idexx practices, everyone loved the Quant C6 and SDMA - the folks in my Zoetis practices feel there isn't enough research behind them and they're ultimately just a money-maker for Idexx.","Veterinarian.

https://github.com/steccas/myst-manager

It is meant to create a manager if you have multiple nodes but also create its own node. Probably you don't need to spin up everything in there. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/stks60/possible_vps_node_runner/hywfhkz/  Yeah, I just spinned it out with port forwarding using docker.

I have traffic running on it.

I just had to open the oracle firewall ports ofc. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/stks60/possible_vps_node_runner/hx5xdf1/  Have you opened iptables ports? Use docker ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/stks60/possible_vps_node_runner/hymz3ny/  Yes, I answered to the post with a repo, but please read my answer. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/stks60/possible_vps_node_runner/hywfki6/  This guy is right default configuratin is s\*\*\*; I'm a cybersec specialyst so I know what I'm talking about.

You don't even get a separate IP device (ie. wg0) so even applying fw rules or a IPS is difficult.

Also node analysis is really bad, some integration with tools like grafana would be great, here again a separate ip dev would help a lot.

This is not plug and play solution.

EDIT:

Try to fill in an issue here: https://github.com/mysteriumnetwork/node ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvjtt94/  Hi! Yes I did open because I was having a lot of doubt.

In the end it's not to bad, and using docker can let someone achieve even host isolation, but even in this case an added layer of security with the right settings can be achieved.

Also, I think that better work to prevent bad traffic FROM the node can be taken.

I'm working in creating a stack with a filtering DNS, IPS and some filtering rules.
And ofc better monitoring integration.

I think in general that they are steps to let the project to become a better product.

I'm happy to read that you solved your problem anyhow and thanks for the details given :)

I will create a repo soon for node deployment. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvosgyf/  I do really agree with all your points!

Containerization in general is essential in these cases, it's easier to use and just secure by default. Even in professional, enterprise environment it is my way to go.

They should really do as you suggested, propose it as a suggested config. The container + firewall trigger solution would be already way better.
Of course help from external firewall is even better.

How did you block the webui? A rule using the container ip/subnet itself? What about the container localhost?

On this regard I was working on some egress rules to prevent attacks, scanning, etc. Wich rules did you use? You have some suggestions?

In my case, I'm not going to run nodes in a home network/home lab environment, I'm not comfortable with that.

I'm running them hosting/vps etc. So in all cases each node will have it's VM. Even in this case, I'm still deploying with docker, but in some cases this can create problems with NAT... So host network should be used, but in working on that.

Now for these VPS I'm trying to filter as much traffic as possible using iptables/ufw, for now I'm blocking the usual bad packets (XMAS et al) in the outgoing chain. And as you pointed out I was trying to disable the webui access from the VM completely. To access it I'm planning to use SWAG (a Nginx proxy with certbot and fail2ban), then, to avoid other rules etc it will not be accessed by VPN but with a zero trust access like the cloudflare one (this should hide the IP and set up strong authentication to the webui).

Next steps as I already stated is, DNS, IPS, Monitoring.

In this case a dedicated VPN could be better.

For this in planning to:
- instantiate 2 pihole + unbound in 2 vps/nodes or maybe one per node. With good lists.
But maybe the first solution is better.

- Then grafana should be centralized as uptime Kuma.

- Suricata on every node to filter egress attack.

- Heimdall or another dashboard with all the nodes ui links using SWAG Proxy.

Especially points 2 and 4 would have me inclined to use a dedicated VPN. in this VPN nodes will reach the DNS.
Individual nodes web ui will not be exposed, so there will not be a proxy on every node but just one, the latter will be protected by zero access and could allow to access the nodes webuis via the VPN.

While this solution is fairly easy to implement using docker (also easy because the big services are central and not one per node) really good FW rules will be needed for the VPN.

In any case I thank you for the insights, the suggestions you're giving and for volunteering to help with the repo.

Regarding that, I'm planning to publish a bare public repo to work on, (just need to make the small things I did a little bit more presentable) 

It will be open so everyone can contribute.

Looking forward to read your opinions. 😊 ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hvrtajr/  Dang, for some reason my answer isn't here!

The rules are very good indeed, you did perfect isolation and took measures to stop common attacks. I suggest stopping malformed packets and limit-rating syn and pings. (I've put your rules in the repo)

For the UI you are right, and I think is pretty much well defended by default.

Yes I'm working on 2 repos, soon I will make them more presentable and maybe create a post ahahhathe internet via the node, his identity will remain unknown.

&#x200B;

You're very very good. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hwe3h1t/  Hi and sorry if I took some time!

To be honest you did a great job, I'd just add blocking of malformed IP packets and rate limits for SYN and ICMP packets.

The more services you find that could be blocked the better, and that's what you did!

Blocking outright all the internal network is great also.

Regarding traefik, I think it is way better to stand with nginx, and especially swag that has fail2ban integrated.

I found that port 4449 is pretty closed off by default. So that's good.

&#x200B;

On the VPS vs ISP: I honestly think that they are still monitored in any case.

But being the user already connected behind the myst VPN is identity is already protected.

&#x200B;

Also Im about to push 2 repos, but I'm not sure if the DNS will be useful; because I didn't understand wich DNS will be used by the VPN client ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hwe587j/  HI!

\[never tried to do that with Proxmox's firewall\]

It may be that it does it by default... but only egress.

\[doesn't need reloads or rebuilds\]

True!

\[failtoban...\]

Yes but it does serve a different purpose, it's light and is just a layer of security.

\[from my ISP's point of view becomes an indecipherable mess\]

Yes... but I am just too concerned in the ISP just reporting all this traffic that I don't control as mine.

\[DNS\]

Yes but I read that the user can choose which one, so if it is automatic he would use the node's one? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/sj8qmi/residential_security_concerns_kind_stranger_do/hx18vj1/  Wow, how did you attract this amount of traffic? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/snwzzb/well_someones_having_a_downloading_spree_i_see/hwe27s4/","Other.

DucksEatFreeInSubway,"It sounds promising. I guess you'll know early next week.

But as the saying goes, don't let go of one monkey bar until you have hold of the other.Eko Core didn't work for me. It's too large for puppies and small dogs and there's about a second delay before it starts to register sounds which of course doesn't work for wiggly dogs.  The Bluetooth is nice and I wish there were other options for it but the Eko ain't it.Agreed whole heartedly. I started relief after 2 years after graduation and in hind sight I probably should've waited another year but the situation called for it at the time.

I love relief but it certainly requires a pretty solid foundation which you're not going to have after just one year of practice.   You need to be able to adapt quickly and find information fast on new protocols (sometimes even better protocols) that you're not used to.To my understanding you can but if you say picked up a shift with a hospital through Roo then later it popped up again on RSVP, I don't think you can, per your contract with Roo, take that shift.I don't bother honestly.

What do you do in such a role?I look for salary/benefits listed (to include reasonable work hours), I look for a tech/doctor ratio, and I look for somewhere I'd actually like to live.

Equity doesn't matter to me because I've read too many stories of that being a bullshit promise or something else that causes it to somehow not come to fruition.  I automatically assume it's a way of trying to make it seem more appealing without actually offering anything.

I don't use a recruiting service. I have plenty of recruiters just contact me (unwantingly) through LinkedIn, email, or text.  Clinics found through relief offer jobs all the time too.Banfield is gonna find themselves short on relief vets.  People already don't want to work there.   I don't know anyone who *likes* working at Banfield.  They work there for the money and because as relief they're not bound by any Banfield shit.  They get paid then leave.  If it's tolerable, they might come back for another round of that fat paycheck.What are those vaccine clinics like? Never done one but I always envision them as sheer chaos.  Like herd medicine, just running them through the 'chute'.I guess that would depend on which metro area.

starwish68,"OP has clearly stated that other doctors are called Dr so and so, why is it an ego thing to not want to be only doctor not referred to as such? 
In every clinic I’ve worked at, you refer to someone as dr until told by them to switch to either first or last name. I regularly work alongside relief doctors and I always call them Dr Lastname until corrected (and I am a DVM who asks coworkers to call me by my first name). I find it rather telling that so many on here are quick to assume OP is arrogant rather than finding it insulting they are being put down by someone’s refusal to acknowledge their position.These were some things that helped me in my 4th year.

Keep your home in order - remember to clean and do laundry regularly so your time off isn’t used to desperately clean a messy place. Plus a clean house makes you feel less stressed to come home to. 
Meal prepping was also immensely helpful in making sure I had enough to eat (because there will be times you’re scarfing something down at 1am while writing notes) without splurging on eating out.  

Take time to do non-vet things. Some of my classmates spent all of their time studying for NAVLE but that would have destroyed me lol. I went on a lot of hikes with my dog and friends, I befriended my retiree neighbor and did projects with her, I made time to visit my parents every few months. Do not let school consume you. 

Just know life will suck for the next year but working as a vet in GP is so much less stressful than school so there is light at the end of the tunnel. Befriend your classmates so you can lean on each other during rotations - there were a number of times I covered for people or they covered for me without the preceptor knowing/penalizing anyone.I’m two years out of school and I can only speak to my own experience. 30min for a 50lb dog spay is not at all my norm. Even for the more experienced vets, my practice estimates 1.5 hrs (total anesthesia time) in case things are messy in there. I do wonder if you’re rushing through and if you would benefit from slowing down. Make sure you’re getting appropriate visualization, tying good square knots, double ligating. 

I have (so far) only torn one cat pedicle in my surgical career and that was from trying to autoligate. I’m sure there’s a happy medium between me neurotically double ligating and triple checking things before letting go of tissue versus rushing through and having ligature trouble. 

As a student, I’m not sure you’re even really allowed to be on your own? It is 100% the supervising vet’s job to help you and I honestly can’t believe they left you alone - that is irresponsible on the first day.It definitely depends on how taxing school is on you, which you won’t know until you start. Some need to study a ton or are just exhausted from it. I personally worked about only 15hrs/week including weekends which was great for not getting overwhelmed in my case.

sfchin98,"With the understanding that this Reddit post is not a job ad, biggest immediate red flag is “competitive wage.” Everyone says that, I’ve never seen any job ad that declares their salary not to be competitive. There’s a shortage of vets, and we’re inundated with recruiting emails. It’s not uncommon for us to simply delete/ignore any ads that don’t list an actual salary range. For reference, the average new graduate is making about $120-130K while the average vet salary overall is around $150-160K. Oregon has a cost of living between 10-30% higher than national average, so you’re not going to get a discount for location. Including production, I would bet it’s not unusual for vets in OR to be making $180-200K. 

This is not to say you need to match that, given your circumstances, and you’d be surprised how many vets are willing to work for straight salary, but you probably still need to be able to pay $120-150K depending on experience. 

If you are a 501(c)(3) organization then new grads working for you should qualify for federal Public Service Loan Forgiveness, which is effectively a six figure bonus at the 10 year mark, paid for by the federal government. I would double check with your lawyer/accountant before making it a prominent part of your recruiting. 

I would probably focus a lot of your recruiting at Oregon State, on the assumption there is some population of students there who are from Oregon, want to remain in Oregon, and are paying in-state tuition so they have a slightly lower loan burden. Those vet students also are less likely to be weighing offers from low cost of living areas like Oklahoma or Tennessee where $120K goes a lot farther. 

The other major red flag I see is that all your vets are near retirement age. Fairly or not, the presumption when a vet clinic has only retirement age vets is that they are not practicing up to date medicine. And even if what they are comfortable doing is not substandard, it’s unlikely that they are successfully integrating newer technologies and procedures into their practice. This is perhaps especially true of a clinic that is primary serving a low income client base. This will be an additional drag on recruiting new grads, who are often looking for additional mentoring, but more so from mid-career vets rather than near-retirement vets. I am not sure how you address that issue.A hospital can be well-run and nonprofit, though. The key is not to try to be ""nonprofit"" simply by offering substandard wages and cheaping out on supplies, infrastructure, and operations. A good nonprofit has to be run like a normal for-profit hospital, and then there has to be great fundraising and establishment of trust and engagement with the community. Even just staying in Oregon, DoveLewis is a very prominent, successful, and well-regarded ER/Specialty hospital that is a 501(c)(3) org. And of course the Animal Medical Center in NYC and Angell in Boston are two of the largest and oldest specialty hospitals in the country, both also 501(c)(3) orgs.I am not sure about Australia, but in the US most interventional radiologists are actually not radiologists. Most are surgeons, internists, cardiologists, or criticalists. The two primary pioneers of veterinary interventional radiology are Chick Weisse and Allyson Berent, both formerly of UPenn (where they developed their skills by training with human IR specialists at the UPenn medical school) and currently at the AMC in New York City where they established the first (and probably only) full time veterinary IR service. Chick is a surgeon and Allyson is an internist. 

Basically, most vets who do IR only do those procedures as a small fraction of their practice. The number of cases where IR is indicated is somewhat few and far between, and the procedures are quite expensive to the pet owner. So the question then becomes ""What do you want to do with the rest of your time when you aren't doing an interventional radiology procedure?"" If you're more into the ""interventional"" side, then surgery, IM, ECC is the way to go. But if you mainly want to do radiology, occasionally doing IR procedures, then radiology is fine. 

In terms of learning how to do it, you just need to find someone who does them regularly and is willing to train you. There is no formal residency in IR, and generally speaking IR procedures are not part of the residency standards for radiology, surgery, IM, ECC, or cardio. People who have an interest in IR basically need to seek it out on their own. Chick and Allyson do have a fellowship in IR, so some people go that route, but they only take one fellow per year.Nuc Med is generally rare outside of very large specialty hospitals, university teaching hospitals, or equine practices. But certainly those places will have radiologists to help perform/interpret the studies. Treatment with radioactive iodine for hyperthyroidism can also be done by radiologists or internists.

Interventional radiology, as noted in my original comment, is performed by whoever is interested in it, including radiologists. For the most part, radiologists who do IR are doing the easier procedures like tracheal stents or urethral stents. The more complicated catheterization procedures (coil embolization of patent ductus arteriosus or intrahepatic portosystemic shunt) will more commonly be done by cardiologists or surgeons. Intra-cardiac procedures like balloon valvuloplasty will also generally be cardiologists. Subcutaneous ureter bypass catheter placement is also usually fluoro-assisted, but it's a surgical implant so is almost always done by surgeons.

Radiation oncology is a totally different branch and requires its own residency. There are people who are double-boarded in radiology and radiation oncology, but they're quite rare (most are either very old vets who were grandfathered in when the radiology/rad onc specialty college was established, or people who spent a LOT of years in residency). It is more common for people to be double boarded in medical oncology and radiation oncology (still two residencies).This is a guess, as I am in the US, but you likely face two different challenges. First, there are no AVMA accredited vet schools in SEA, so in order to work in the US you would either need to go through the ECFVG/PAVE process to sit for the NAVLE, or you would be restricted to working in university teaching hospitals where you can work under an umbrella veterinary license. As a foreigner who presumably does not have US citizenship or green card, you also would need a work visa, which is distributed as a lottery and on a different schedule than the US academic year. This generally makes it quite challenging to get a US internship as a foreign citizen, because an institution that matches with you has no guarantee you'll get the visa, and even if you do you wouldn't be able to start until around October, while the internship normally starts in June. For this reason, most institutions are wary of ranking foreign vets/students for internship.

Second, as you indicate in your post, most places want to see LORs from boarded specialists. This is because the idea of a rotating internship (in the US at least), is that you are working almost exclusively with specialists, rotating from one specialty service to another for 1-4 weeks at a time. You spend a lot of time in emergency/critical care, internal medicine, and surgery, and of course it's not just observational — you will be a primary clinician on the service taking on cases and being responsible for them. So the internship hospital will want to know that you have some experience in a specialty environment and can handle yourself. Most US based internships will want to see LORs from diplomates of either the American or European specialty colleges (e.g. for surgery, DACVS or DECVS). Some may recognize fellows of the Australian/New Zealand college (FANZCVS). I think your easiest bet to find specialists to work with would be to look to New Zealand or Australia and find a hospital with specialists, and spend some externship time there. Although because of the first hurdle of being a foreign vet, you may be better off looking for an internship in AUS/NZ or in Europe, and then applying for residencies in the US afterwards (residency programs are more willing to take foreign vets, as the delay is only 3 months for visa and can be worth the gamble for a 3-4 year residency).I don't think Reddit is going to be able to tell you whether it's the path for you. You will need to actually experience it (along with all the other facets of vet med) and see how it is. Most vet schools will have a pathology club for vet students, so you should join that. I don't know the pathology dept at NCSU specifically, but most pathology depts are usually pretty welcoming to any students who show real interest in pathology.You need to put actual numbers in your job ads as a bare minimum to get any interest. For your reference, for last year's graduating class of veterinarians, the mean starting salary for small animal private practice was $133,000 ($112K base plus $21K expected production): [https://www.avma.org/news/veterinary-starting-salaries-rise-2023-educational-debt-holds-steady](https://www.avma.org/news/veterinary-starting-salaries-rise-2023-educational-debt-holds-steady)

Daly City has a very high cost of living, quick Google search looks like 60-70% higher than national average depending on source. So I'd be looking for something in the neighborhood of $180,000 base and anticipated $213,000 including production as a bare minimum. And that's for a new graduate, so if you're serious about ""commensurate with experience"" then it should be higher than that for an experienced vet.That is not unusual in the highest cost of living areas like Daly City (Bay Area) or NYC. In the same way that people in the lowest cost of living parts of the country like Oklahoma are getting offers with base salary in the $70-80K range which is 30% below average (despite cost of living only being 13% lower than national average). Veterinarians devaluing ourselves is definitely part of the problem that perpetuates our low pay relative other equivalently trained healthcare professionals.Yes, most vets have free time, families, pets, and a life outside of work. It depends of course on what branch of vet med you go into, and to some degree your own job selection (some people are just workaholics), but if when you say ""one of my parents works in human medicine"" you mean that they are a physician or work a physician's schedule, then you probably have a good idea of the time commitment. An average small animal clinical vet might have a schedule that looks like 4 weekday 10 hour shifts, a rotating weekend schedule that might be one Saturday per month, and likely 3-4 weeks vacation per year. Many vets end up having to spend extra time after their shift end to finish paperwork and do some client callbacks, so on average 40-50 hours per week actually working plus their weekend rotation. 

And as I said, there's a very wide range depending on what area of vet med you go into. Some people might be ER vets, pulling 12-14 hour shifts for 3 days in row then have like a week off. Some might be specialist surgeons or neurologists, so they have to be on call for emergency surgery which can be very disruptive to routine life but comes with high pay. Some might work industry or government jobs and have a very predictable 9-5, M-F schedule. Some might be full time teleradiologists who work 25 hours total per week, all from home.There's some imprecision/hand-waving in the description here. 6-12 months is a wide range. If you make 80k in 6 months, that's 160k for a year which is higher than the average vet salary in the US right now. 80k in 12 months would be more like the bottom of the range for a new grad in small animal private practice. You should ensure there is a clear date at which you switch from your ""introductory"" pay you your regular base/production or whatever.

What you've described isn't really an ""internship"" at least not in the traditional sense in vet med. An internship should be rotating, meaning you spend weeks at a time working in different specialty services under the tutelage of board-certified vets, usually at minimum Internal Medicine, Surgery, and ECC (but usually much more, such as Neuro, Cardio, Onco, Anesthesia, Ophtho, Derm, Radiology, etc. depending on how large the specialty hospital is). To me, it sounds like this job is using the word ""internship"" to justify low salary for the first year, when most new grads are not expected to be fast/efficient/productive.

I think that is fine, so long as the salary is not markedly below market for whatever area you're looking at (i.e. 80k is totally fine for Oklahoma, but certifiably low-income in NYC). You should also ensure that the ""mentorship"" aspect is well defined in your contract, and that the consequences if they should fail to live up to the mentorship aspect are also spelled out in the contract.In general the requirement for teleradiology will be board certification by either the ACVR or ECVDI and a license to practice veterinary medicine where you live. Most of the large global teleradiology companies pay quite well (in the US most full-time teleradiologists will make in the range of $300-600K (USD) annually. I think most of the large global teleradiology companies (Antech, IDEXX, VetCT, etc.) might have a slight differential pay for their radiologists based on cost of living in their country of residence, but I am not totally sure about that. It won't be a big difference, though, because they don't want to discourage radiologists from living in time zones with reduced coverage (most of their radiologists will be in the North American and Western European time zones, so coverage in Asia/Australia tends to be poor).I don't know any veterinary or human radiologists who are concerned about AI taking our jobs in our lifetime. Perhaps we are all collectively delusional, but I doubt it. For your consideration: In order for AI to ""replace"" a radiologist, the company who owns the AI product would need to accept liability for interpretation errors made by their AI.Plenty of people do a mid-career switch to vet med. There were two students in my class in their 50s, and several in their 30s and 40s. Really the biggest question is financial. If you’ve made enough money in your career up to now that you can fund the educational path without loans, you are good to go. If you need to take out major loans, then you’ll have to do some number crunching to figure out if you can make it work. Figure you’ll need 2-3 years to complete your academic and veterinary experience prerequisites, then 4 years of school means you’ll be in your mid-40s when you graduate. Tuition for 4 years will be $200-300K (depending on if you get into your in-state school). Most people need to budget another $100-150K for living expenses, but presumably your calculation will be different depending on your personal situation (Own your own home? Have a spouse/partner with a job? Have kids? Etc). 

Graduation in your mid-40s you’ll have about 20-25 years of working as a vet. Current new graduates in small animal private practice are averaging about $133K for their first contract. That will be up a bit in 8 years (although tuition and living expenses may also be higher than the figures I listed). Many vets these days have trouble paying off their loans in 20-25 years and may go for an income-based repayment plan (in which the balance of your loans are forgiven after 20 or 25 years). So if at age 40 you are entering vet school in the same financial situation as the typical 22 year old student, you may end up spending your entire career as a vet paying off the loans.The ones I remember were the Nextel phones. We had those in my internship, but that was almost 20 years ago, before smartphones were really a thing. Nextel is defunct now, I think. 

This article has some info about current communications systems used in human healthcare: https://www.hfmmagazine.com/articles/4663-nurse-communication-systems-keep-advancingYou'll have a hard time recruiting if you can't do $120K in a HCOL area. The mean starting salary for last year's graduates in small animal private practice was $133K. ([https://www.avma.org/news/veterinary-starting-salaries-rise-2023-educational-debt-holds-steady](https://www.avma.org/news/veterinary-starting-salaries-rise-2023-educational-debt-holds-steady))

Now, that's calculated from average base salary of $112K with anticipated production of $21K. You could get away with a base in the $110-115K range if you think you can reasonably demonstrate that the new associate can expect to produce an additional $20-30K on top of that, but that would put you at right about average for a new graduate from last year. Chances are the 2024 graduates will be a little higher. Also, that $133K number is the average for the whole country, meaning a good number of new grads are above that. If you're in a HCOL area, chances are prospective vets will be expecting more.

You say you can't afford 120K+ ""without growing a bit"" but if you are going from 1 doctor to 2, you have no choice but to grow a bit. Even if your current owner is looking to go part-time into semi-retirement, a new associate is going to be expecting full time work, not just taking over the 0.5 or even 0.75 time that the current owner is scaling back. So you will need to demonstrate that you have a plan in place for how to grow the business/caseload to make it worthwhile. You will likely need to hire at least one additional tech (CVT ideally) and likely also at least one additional vet assistant. You should ensure your business plan can accommodate the new hires, and be prepared to include it in the contract with the new vet.

I think the main area where you could potentially provide something that corporate cannot would be equity in the practice, profit sharing, and/or a path to ownership. https://todaysveterinarybusiness.com/fair-shares-equity-profits/People have a tendency to compare outlier high salary GP/ER vets with outlier low salary specialists. On average, most specialists (we are talking common clinical small animal specialties working in private practice) will make 2-3x the average GP and probably 1.5-2x the average ER (non-boarded) vet. Whether that additional salary is worth the additional 4-6 years of training (along with the poverty wages and accruing interest on student loans) is a personal decision. 

For radiology specifically, I cannot imagine any specialty currently that makes more money *per hour worked* than radiology. Most radiologists I know are working at least part time teleradiology and making about $400-500K for 40 hours/week. Those working full time teleradiology are making that amount for about 30 hours/week (and no commute). Those working full time in-house practice are making less, maybe $300-350K for 40-50 hours. Not bad at all, but comparable to other clinical specialties as opposed to absurd teleradiology bubble salary. One big advantage of radiology, of course, is that due to the lack of client contact and no need for referral letters, callbacks, sitting around talking about cases, and other such ""non-revenue generating"" activities, almost all the hours worked are productive.According to the VIRMP site:

>Commitment Process:  
One of the most important aspects of participation in the VIRMP is the early commitment which is made by the applicant; that is, the applicant must agree to accept a position at any of the institutions or private practices which he/she ranked. When creating an account, the applicant will electronically sign an agreement to this effect. Failure to comply will result in sanctions including a ban from participation in the VIRMP for at least 3 years. This agreement must be completed online no later than February 16, 2024.

So the deadline to withdraw has already passed. The match is not a traditional job offer/acceptance situation. When you signed the electronic commitment, that was your acceptance of whatever ""job offer"" is assigned to you by the match program. You have already accepted any potential job offer from all the internship programs you decided to apply for. You are already past the point of having the option to reject an internship ""offer"" without penalty.There's no specific timeline after the match. Essentially, at some point in the days/weeks after the match, your internship institution should contact you and provide information regarding starting dates, orientation schedule, state licensing info (if needed), and to request any personal information they need for employment/HR purposes. 

If you are going to reject the internship, out of professional courtesy you should do that ASAP when you get your match result. You will still be penalized by the VIRMP with the 3 year freeze, and you likely will go on a Do Not Hire list at the institution, but you at least give the institution the opportunity to scramble and find a replacement for the internship spot you are vacating. 

You should probably be aware also that even after the 3 year VIRMP freeze, you would be seriously damaging your chances of ever matching in the future. Vet Med is a surprisingly small world, and many people (especially in academia) are well connected. Your decision to reject an internship after the match will reflect poorly on the faculty who wrote your reference letters, and they will almost certainly not agree to write you another letter if you decide to reapply in the future. Chances are none of your other current faculty would be comfortable writing a letter for you after a 3 year hiatus (especially knowing the reason for the hiatus). So during those three years you would need to establish new positive working relationships, ideally with boarded specialists, who would write your reference letters and directly address your previous actions. Even then, many internship programs would likely view your application with a very big red flag, unless there was an extenuating circumstance like an immediate family member fell ill and you had to pause/upend your career path in order to take care of them.If you have the time and money to spend on training to be a CVT, it's fine. But don't approach it like a ""stepping stone"" to becoming a vet. It would be like becoming a Registered Nurse as a ""stepping stone"" to becoming a Medical Doctor. Essentially, you should view it as a backup career option, which is not totally unreasonable as the acceptance rate for vet school is like 8-12%.

The problem is that although there is overlap in knowledge between the two careers, most of the classes you take aren't applicable to vet school pre-reqs (as far as I'm aware). So after you got your CVT, you would then need to go back to school and take all the vet school requirements. Furthermore, it is generally advantageous to have varied animal/industry experience, not just all small animal clinical experience. Do you know how many vet school applicants are small animal clinical vet techs/assistants? Like, almost all of them. It's very hard to differentiate yourself when you're an Animal Science major and working as a small animal vet tech/assistant like 90% of the applicants. Vet schools like to see people with experience in large/farm animal, exotics, lab animal, wildlife, etc. 

So if you are happy with the idea of being a CVT as a career, and applying for vet school is more of a shot in the dark, it's a fine strategy. But if you're pretty focused/set on getting into vet school, there's better ways to spend your time and money to maximize your chances of getting in.You probably won't like this answer, but it is quite difficult to become great at radiographs without active guidance. There's the adage of needing 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something, but what's usually lost from that concept is that it's 10,000 hours of \*\*guided\*\* practice. That is, being supervised by a teacher, trainer, coach, etc. to correct your mistakes and reinforce your successes. Without the guidance, you are very likely just reinforcing your bad habits. I have met many GPs and ER vets with years of experience who \*think\* they are good at rads, but in reality are probably worse than an average vet student who just finished their radiology rotation. To take it a step further, even radiologists who are working solo and/or teleradiology exclusive and therefore very rarely getting second opinions on their reads or followup from surgeons and pathologists also end up reinforcing bad habits. Without surgeons and pathologists to keep us honest, we may as well believe we have a 100% accuracy rate.

To me, the hardest part about learning to read radiographs is being able to differentiate normal from abnormal. This is a lot harder than it sounds, because there is a very wide range of ""normal"" and it overlaps with a lot of ""abnormal."" And what I mean by normal is ""no clinically significant abnormalities"", which is different from ""textbook normal."" A prime example of this is abdominal radiographs on a patient with acute vomiting and diarrhea. Most of the time, I read these out as normal abdomen. The intern or ER doc may then come and ask, so these don't look like gastroenteritis? To which I ask, what are the radiographic signs of gastroenteritis? And they don't answer, because of course there aren't really any specific radiographic signs of gastroenteritis. I may see some things that I associate more often with gastroenteritis — fragmented gas pattern in the jejunum, diffuse gas dilation of the GI tract, etc. — and if the clinical history fits I may conclude acute gastroenteritis so the ordering clinician feels better about their workup. But in reality, those radiographic signs are pretty common in animals with no GI symptoms at all, so it wouldn't be wrong to just conclude ""normal abdomen."" The goal of abdominal rads in the acutely vomiting animal is not to rule \*\*in\*\* gastroenteritis, it is to rule \*\*out\*\* mechanical obstruction, radiopaque foreign material, or other gross abnormalities like abdominal mass effect or ascites. ""Normal abdomen"" effectively rules those things out, leaving you with a provisional diagnosis of acute gastroenteritis so long as the remainder of the clinical picture fits (i.e., not in acute renal failure, liver failure, Addisonian crisis, etc.). 

So ultimately this is where reading textbooks like Thrall is useful, even if the example images aren't amazing. You learn what the actual radiographic signs are that are classically associated with disease processes. There isn't really a better overall textbook out there than Thrall. For thorax specifically though, I like the BSAVA Manual of Canine and Feline Thoracic Imaging: [https://www.wiley.com/en-us/BSAVA+Manual+of+Canine+and+Feline+Thoracic+Imaging-p-9780905214979](https://www.wiley.com/en-us/bsava+manual+of+canine+and+feline+thoracic+imaging-p-9780905214979) It's a little bit dated (published 2008) but it's not like there have been major advances in thoracic radiography since then. The BSAVA abdomen and MSK books are decent, but not as good as the thorax one.

For websites, [https://www.veterinaryradiology.net/](https://www.veterinaryradiology.net/) is a good repository of cases. It's run by Allison Zwingenberger at UC Davis, she is generally one of the more highly regarded academic radiologists out there. 

This is also a great online atlas: [https://www.imaios.com/en/vet-anatomy](https://www.imaios.com/en/vet-anatomy) although it's mainly for CT/MRI. There is one section for dog MSK rads, which I think is still useful. This is BY FAR my most used reference in day to day work, but I don't know how useful it is to a non-radiologist. It is $95/year as a subscription, but the dog MSK rads (and also the dog CT head) atlases are free.

This is an online lecture on thoracic imaging by Tony Pease, also a very highly regarded (formerly academic) radiologist: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwpzKmqsruM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwpzkmqsrum)

I admit I have not watched that lecture, but I implicitly trust anything that Tony Pease has to say about radiology. 

And I think in terms of day-to-day practice, the best thing you can do is send out as many cases as you can for teleradiology readouts, and just test out your interpretation against the radiologist's. Hopefully there's a telerad service your clinic uses and trusts, and any time you're at all unsure about your rads just offer the telerad readout to the pet owner.For me, more so a love of science, especially biology, and medicine. I've never even owned a dog.Radiologist here. Alternative radiology programs are quite rare (there are only 2 in the world currently, one in Quebec and one in New Zealand). They are generally customized for an individual resident, and the ""alternative"" aspect is usually that the supervising radiologists will be spread out over 2 or more institutions rather than all in one location. There is still a requirement that a residency director be on location at the primary hospital for at least 50% of the time, and at least one other supervising radiologist (but typically more than one) be available for immediate live clinical consultation/interaction the rest of the time (usually meaning the resident goes to a different hospital with a radiologist, or the other radiologist is a contracted locum at the primary hospital, but technically could also be a virtual locum on a Zoom call all day). 

Needless to say, in order for this to happen generally it means the radiologist(s) know you well and absolutely love you such that they are willing to go through the considerable legwork of jumping through all the necessary hoops to get an alternative ACVR residency set up and approved, and then to go through the effort of training you (which takes considerable time away from clinical duties, which is a significant ask for a private practice radiologist). There is still a requirement of at least 2 boarded radiologists to establish an alternative track residency, so if you are restricted in not being able to leave your geographic area, there needs to be two radiologists within your radius who agree to take on this task of training you.What niche branch/specialty are you talking about? It likely varies to some degree from specialty to specialty.

That said, it also varies quite a bit from program to program. *Most* residencies will likely use GPA/rank more as a tier system than a straight rank (e.g., top quartile of class, second quartile, etc.). Each program will likely have some sort of cutoff for GPA/rank below which they don't consider a candidate, but it will vary from place to place. I am a radiologist, and I know that where I did my residency they throw out any applicant who was in the bottom half of their class. Yet I know of people who were bottom 10% of their class who matched at other radiology residencies (and those residencies have good academic reputations too). 

I have yet to hear of any residency/specialty that doesn't value the reference letters as the most important part of the application. I have no doubt the people who were bottom 10% of their class and still matched must have had amazing references. Obviously, someone who is in the top 25% of the class will generally have an advantage over someone in the bottom 25%, but I would bet the letters of recommendation can trump the class rank.Oh, I think you will be fine. Last year there were 37 applicants for 57 lab animal residency spots. Not all the spots are in the match, I think, but the point being you likely won't have much trouble getting yourself into a lab animal residency somewhere if that is your goal. You should continue trying to improve your grades, of course, and make sure you keep working with researchers and get good references ideally from DACLAMs, but I think if lab animal is what you want to do you will eventually become one.When you say “wild birds” do you mean some Good Samaritan brings in a pigeon with a broken wing they found on the street, or do you mean the Bronx Zoo has a toucan that requires medical attention? If the latter, absolutely you need to be a boarded specialist. If the former, any vet can do that if they wish, but it will likely be at your own expense since wild birds don’t have owners to pay for them. Vet med is a minimally regulated industry, and any vet with a license is legally allowed to treat any species other than human.That is sort of ""in between"". The WBS has one full time staff veterinarian. She is not a board-certified specialist, but has a lot of wildlife/avian related experience including an internship at a wildlife center. I would guess she consults with various specialists on individual cases depending on the need (e.g., surgery, ophthalmology, radiology). 

I would suspect most bird sanctuaries are not well enough funded to have a veterinarian on staff, so they probably have relationships with local avian/exotics vets who would likely be non-boarded or else ABVP (Avian) boarded who spend most of their time with pet birds but consult with the sanctuary as needed. If there is a close enough vet school with a zoo/exotics/wildlife department that would also be a common route. 

Basically, making a career out of mostly or exclusively working with native wild birds in a sanctuary/rehab environment is an extremely niche (and likely very low-paying) path. Most who end up in that situation probably spent a lot of time carving out a custom path to it, with a decent amount of luck along the way, as opposed to following some well-established path hitting standard goalposts/benchmarks.I wouldn't worry too much about being sued over something like that. Realistically, in order to lose a case like that, you'd have to have a radiologist willing to testify that your miss was a major error that affected the outcome of the case and that a general practitioner should be expected to identify. Any doctor, radiologist or not, who claims that loss of serosal detail in the right cranial quadrant is a sure sign of pancreatitis that shouldn't be missed is full of shit. As a radiologist, I am well aware of all the classical radiographic signs of pancreatitis, and anecdotally based on followup abdominal ultrasounds in these cases I can confidently say the classical signs of pancreatitis on radiographs are both poorly sensitive and poorly specific. I am generally actually hesitant to even teach people the radiographic signs, because it probably just means more vets will be misdiagnosing pancreatitis.

What you should be worried about is making major radiologic errors, by which I mean a missed or misdiagnosed lesion which led directly to a negative outcome that could have been avoided with a proper diagnosis. Missing a GI obstruction would be an example. On the flip side, incorrectly diagnosing a GI obstruction leading to a negative surgical explore would arguably also be a major misdiagnosis. Without knowing your actual skill level at reading radiographs I don't know how concerned you should be about things like that.

As far as radiologists go, there's a recent paper out of the AMC looking at error rates among veterinary radiologists (at the AMC, anyways), and they had a 4.6% major error rate (i.e., radiologist messed up, leading to death of patient). That's, like, relatively high. So chances are non-radiologists would have a significantly higher rate of major errors. I still wouldn't be overly concerned about being sued, as your error would have to be pretty egregious for a radiologist to testify that you should be penalized for it, but as a matter of basic medical standard and patient care you should maybe be concerned. I would say most radiologists are at least a little concerned about a bad miss on any case we read.

https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/vru.13259&#x200B;

>I read (most, ok, some!) of the article you linked.  I agree, that error rate is high... but, I assume the cases coming into AMC have a much higher acuity than what most radiologists are reading!  

Most radiologists in clinical practice are probably reading a comparable selection of studies as what they see at the AMC. The 4.6% error rate is similar to what human (MD) radiologists see. It's a good chance most radiologists are hovering in that 5% range.

&#x200B;

>Also seems like the ones most missed were PE's (which, I always thought were really hard to catch on radiographs).  I wonder how many other radiologists would have 'caught' it with the same presenting history and information.

PEs were actually categorized as ""non-radiologic discrepancies"" (not a radiologist error), because they cannot be diagnosed with the studies we usually perform. You need to do a pulmonary angio-CT, which we usually don't.

&#x200B;

>I am also surprised them lumped so many different imaging modalities in the study (CT, AUS, rads, MRI, ect.).  It makes for a GREAT study, but a bit of informational overload for the common practitioner!

Yeah, this paper was in VRU, which is the radiology journal. It's aimed at radiologists mostly, to basically point out the most common types of errors made so that we can try to avoid them.

&#x200B;

>Missing a GI obstruction would be an example. On the flip side, incorrectly diagnosing a GI obstruction leading to a negative surgical explore would arguably also be a major misdiagnosis  
>  
>I am going to cut you guys a little (A LOT) of slack on this one.  I've seen SO MANY missed GI obstructions, that were (more) obvious on rads 12-24 hours later.

Hopefully you haven't seen radiologists missing GI obstructions! It's one of the basic skills of a radiologist, and I'd say it would be quite rare for a radiologist to miss a GI obstruction on a radiograph. For what it's worth, none of the major radiologic errors listed in the study was a missed GI obstruction.

&#x200B;

>Lately I've been getting around surgical explores by referring to them as ""Diagnostic laparotomies"", I tell them its generally less invasive than a spay, unless I find something.   Offer CT (3k) vs. surgical explore <1k. 

That is certainly a strategy you can take. Most radiologists are averse to negative explores, as that is pretty invasive. The ""old school"" approach was that if don't have a negative explore now and then, you're probably not doing enough surgeries. I think the more modern mindset is that every negative explore is a diagnostic failure. Cost of further diagnostics is certainly a consideration for our clients compared to human med, but if you had a complaint of vomiting and abdominal pain and went to the ER, and their initial imaging screening was inconclusive, I would bet you wouldn't seriously consider letting them do a diagnostic laparotomy on you in lieu of further imaging. I think so long as the pet owners understand that there are other noninvasive but perhaps less timely and more costly options available, and they are giving well informed consent to the exploratory, that's fine.Challenging is very subjective and individual. I am a terrible surgeon, and so I would find being a surgeon quite challenging. I am also not very good at dealing with crashing patients and highly complex critical cases, so I would find ECC quite challenging. But some people are quite good at surgery and ECC, choose those for their careers, and probably don't feel overly challenged by their work.

Vet med is not a good field to go into for ""lucrative."" In a vacuum it is, as most new graduates are now making in the $110K-150K range. But most new graduates also have between $150-400K in student loans, so their overall financial situation is not great. Veterinarians are also (I think) the lowest paid of the doctoral-level healthcare professionals (human physicians, dentists, pharmacists, etc.). I believe the average vet also makes similar or less than the average nurse practitioner or physician assistant, which require fewer years of training and therefore lower educational cost. 

Being an emergency veterinarian can be quite lucrative, especially if you work in a relatively high-cost urban or suburban area, likely averaging in the $200-250K range. And being a board-certified specialist also can be quite lucrative, likely in the $250-350K range. But that also requires at minimum an additional 4 years of post-graduate training, at very low salary. And equivalent-level MD specialists will still make around twice as much as the veterinary specialist (i.e., while a veterinary surgeon may make $350-400K, an MD surgeon will make $700-800K).I am not a surgeon (I am a radiologist) but I will take a stab at some of your questions:

1. Applicants who have years of experience in lieu of a rotating internship are generally at a disadvantage. The key is what the nature of your experience is. If you're working for 3 years as an ER vet in a referral hospital with all the standard specialties that one would have at a rotating internship, that is good experience. If you're working for 2 years in a general practice with minimal to no direct exposure to (boarded) specialists, that's bad experience. 
2. An internship recognized by EBVS is *probably* valid, but I would guess it is viewed as second tier unless it is well enough known as to be internationally reputable.
3. Recs from vets in the UK would hold weight, so long as the vets are boarded specialists. DACVS probably holds more weight than DECVS, but only by a little.
4. I have no idea how you would get involved in publishing something at a private clinic. It really just depends on whether you have contact with a boarded specialist who is willing to co-author the paper with you.
5. The surgery diploma may help a little bit, but not much. Any ACVS residency is likely to be quite skeptical of the diploma/certificate, since they don't really know how rigorous the criteria are for passing. It would likely simply be viewed as ""candidate demonstrates an interest in small animal surgery.""
6. GPA comparison is very challenging unless the residency happens to have a faculty surgeon who is familiar with your school. If a class rank is available and can be shared as part of your application, that may hold more weight than straight GPA.
7. They won't skip over your application without ECFVG/NAVLE, but you are likely at some kind of disadvantage without it. Also note that without ECFVG/NAVLE, even if you pass your boards you would be restricted to working at a university teaching hospital in the US.
8. The most important part of the residency application is your references. Ideally, if you can find a surgeon (or two) who are double boarded in ACVS and ECVS to write letters, that's the best thing you can do. 

Ultimately, the thing that residencies want to know is whether you will pass your boards and whether you will be a functional part of a surgery department for the 3 years of residency. The best way for them to know this is by having references from DACVS vets who know the candidate well and can vouch for their ability to survive a residency. This is the reason why DACVS references are preferred – they have been through the residency and passed the ACVS boards. DECVS may be perfectly knowledgeable and skilled surgeons, but they have not gone through an ACVS residency and passed those boards. There is an assumption that the two are probably close enough that a DECVS can evaluate whether a candidate is residency material, but again, if you have no DACVS references you are likely at a disadvantage. 

Regarding the internship vs experience and the utility of the 1 year surgery diploma/certificate, ultimately the problem is that this is ""nontraditional"" for a candidate for an ACVS residency. There are many, many qualified applicants with a more traditional education/training background, many more than the number of residency spots. Last year, there were 238 applicants for 54 spots, with a match rate of 22.27%. More than 4 applicants for every 1 spot. And the vast majority of those applicants went to an AVMA-Accredited school, did a rotating internship in the US or Canada, and the vast majority of successful applicants also have one or more surgical internships as well. 

ACVS residencies have decided that this background – good grades at accredited school, rotating internship, surgical internship, multiple good DACVS references – is a good predictor of success for a resident. And there are more applicants who fit this profile than there are residency spots. So for you to supplant one of those candidates as a Spanish vet school grad, with no rotating internship, no surgical internship, and no DACVS references, you basically have to be a total rock star of a surgery candidate, and your DECVS references will need to say so emphatically.""Recognized"" is a nebulous word. Because vet med is minimally regulated in the US, anybody can do anything once they have a license. There are plenty of self-styled orthopedic ""specialists"" who have never been through a residency and are certainly not board-certified surgeons. But are boarded European specialists generally considered equivalent to the American specialist counterparts? Yes. At least in radiology, for example, a DECVDI is counted as a DACVR equivalent for the purpose of ACVR residency accreditation. Mind you, we are talking about boarded specialists here, not the Advanced Practitioner certificates.

To work as a vet in the US, you either have to have passed your NAVLE, or you have to work under the umbrella license of a university teaching hospital. This applies to boarded specialists as well. Having a DECVS or DECVDI does not allow you to bypass the need for a valid medical license. So if you are a DECVS who has not passed the NAVLE (either directly or after having gone through ECFVG or PAVE certification first), your only option is to work at a university. That said, there are many such European specialists working at universities, because academia pays like crap so it's hard to attract and retain faculty. 

I think that if your general vet med education is still fresh in your mind, and your plan (being a US citizen) is to live/work in the US permanently, it would be advisable to go through the ECFVG. Even with the cost, you will make a LOT more money if you have the ability to work in private practice, whether as a GP, an ER vet, or a specialist.As many have already noted, the salary is pretty low. $125K is the mean starting salary for 2023 new graduates in private practice. Mean/average salary, meaning a very significant number of new grads are making more than that.

Beyond that, though, what is the clinic organization and working conditions? 20% ownership at signing and ""can change the name to whatever they want"" suggests this new employee has immediate full control of the practice itself. To me this sounds like there's one vet who owns the clinic is looking to retire, allowing the new vet to rename/rebrand however they like. Most people these days are looking to work in a larger team environment, as opposed to being effectively a solo practitioner. This also begs the question of how many support staff are there for the X number of vets? Especially how many RVTs, how many VAs, how many kennel attendants, how many receptionists, and is there a practice manager?There are no reliable data, that I'm aware of. And salaries across the board in vet med have changed drastically since the pandemic, so any data you find from 2020 or earlier is likely so outdated as to be totally useless at this point. There may be internal data within the cardiology college (ACVIM) but I am not privy to it if so. 

Generally speaking, cardiologists are in high demand and make a lot of money. Especially if you decide to work as a mobile practitioner, and even more so if you learn basic abdominal ultrasound and add that to your mobile services. As a basic rule of thumb, simply by being in a major clinical specialty, you probably will be making $250K at bare minimum. I would guess the average cardiologist makes around $350K, and I personally know cardiologists making over $400K, which is probably mid-upper range for private practice. I would not be surprised if mobile cardiologists are making $500K+. This is all wild speculation, though.

Academia is a totally different ballgame, and most likely the average academic cardiologist makes $100-150K, basically the same as a private practice GP. You'll make more as you move up the ladder towards full professor/tenure, but that is quite a slog. Basically, the only reasons to work in academia would be:

1. You have zero to minimal loans and don't care about making money.
2. You are a foreign vet without ECFVG/PAVE/NAVLE certification and have to work under an umbrella license.
3. You love teaching and research so much that you are willing to live the rest of your life in debt for it.>Working at a veterinary school will make you eligible for PSLF loan forgiveness

That is a good point, and I hadn't considered PSLF. I think it has to be a nonprofit organization, though, so many of the newer for-profit schools would not qualify.Whatever allows her maximum face time working under direct supervision with board certified cardiologists. For almost all residency types, the most important aspect of the residency application is the letters of recommendation. She will definitely need to do a rotating internship, and she should only rank sites with full time cardiologists on staff, and there's a decent chance she'll need to do a cardiology specialty internship after the rotating internship.She will need separate letters for internship and residency. It’s the same process (VIRMP Match) just different years. So she will go through the match during final year of vet school for internship, and then she’ll go through the match again during her internship year but for residency. This is assuming you are in North America.The challenge tends to be that getting a visa for the intern/resident in a timely manner is uncertain (on the part of the institution). If you are a Canadian citizen, that obviously is not a problem if you are applying to programs in Canada. In terms of the education, if it's an AVMA accredited school I don't think most places will knock you down in the pecking order. Many of the most well-regarded vet schools in the world are outside the US.If you are at an AVMA accredited school there will be plenty of specialists to network with. And then ideally wherever you do an internship there will also be many additional specialists.Yes, basically any larger referral hospital or teaching hospital with a radiology department (i.e., has radiologists on staff) will have full time techs working in the radiology department. Veterinary radiology tech backgrounds run the gamut: vet assistants who are trained on-the-job to acquire imaging studies, registered vet techs (RVT) who are trained on-the-job and who may progress to vet tech specialization (VTS, involves benchmarks for experience and then passing a certifying exam), human medical radiologic technologists (RT) who shift to vet med part time or full time, human medical registered diagnostic medical sonographers (RDMS) who shift to vet med part time or full time. 

The limiting step for trying to be a career or full-time veterinary rad tech is usually finding a hospital near where you live that has radiologists and a radiology department. There are not enough radiologists, and most of them now do full time or part time teleradiology, so the brick-and-mortar referral hospitals are hurting a little.I didn't like how insurance was taking over the medical field (in the US). I graduated from college in the late 90s, had several family members who were MDs including my father and a couple of my older cousins. So I kind of knew where medicine was headed, and I also really disliked the pre-med students in college, and didn't want to spend my life calling them my colleagues. One of my friends was pre-vet, and she was pretty cool, so I switched sides (took a couple years off after college to pursue other random things but eventually settled on vet school).Starting salary for a small animal private practice GP is about $130k right now, so the simple math says yes, the two additional years of working salary is worth the higher tuition.That starts getting complicated. So if we assume 10% interest rate (which is higher than it is right now, I think), over 7 years you accrue $106k on a $270k loan, bringing you up to $376k when you finish in the US. On a $400k loan over 5 years at 10%, you accrue $109k in interest, putting you at $509k when you finish in the UK. That's a difference of $133k. In order for you to bridge that gap in the two years of working, you'd need to put in somewhere around $6k per month towards your loans.

There's a lot of variables, though, which can result in a significant change in the calculation. Obviously, the real cost of attendance is a big one, so if real cost of attendance in the UK is lower than you estimate, or the cost in the US is higher than you estimate, that will be a big change. Also whatever is that actual interest rate you get will make a big difference. And lastly, if you are single and trying to pay off those loans, it may be a bit harder than if you're married and your spouse is working and is willing to also contribute towards your debt.

Edit: Actually, those interest numbers might be wrong, I used an online interest calculator but it was for a mortgage, so it was presuming you paid off the loan over the interest period.","Veterinarian.

YoYo5465,"Unfortunately other US schools is not possible. It’s insanely expensive and we’d have to long-distance for 4+ years. She applied to Davis as a complete shot in the dark to see where it got her. She always knew that one was unrealistic. She did apply in-state as she grew up in CA and has residency there, too.She thought she had done that with her MSc. in Infectious Disease :( she focused on all the biology she could during it, and did her thesis explicitly in zoonotic diseases and animal/human vectors. It was through LSHTM too, so a very well regarded school. 

Good for you for pursuing your dream! It’s so worth it. No doubt if we had more time we would have made it work. It all just happened so short notice! 

She hasn’t had a single interview in 5 admission cycles…Because they gave her admission in late December, and expected $40,000 in tuition to be paid within 1 week. It was too short notice for her family to get the money together. They also gave her a matter of weeks to get over to Australia: apply for visas (for both of us), pack up, find somewhere to live, give notice to our landlord. It would also have meant trying to find someone to take our dogs for 6+ months before they could be imported to Aus. Logistically, there just wasn’t enough time to make it happen. I have no idea why she applied again this year to go through the same thing.She’s getting it :) you’re right though. Setback after setback over years is very damaging.Not sure why you’re getting downvoted for this. You’re spot on. Seems to be a lot of stigma around general vets face in general, and all the issues the industry has. I think it starts right with this admissions process. It doesn’t help the industry or build resilience, it severely limits the people entering and harms everyone from shortages.Sorry, I wasn’t trying to insinuate 17 year olds are less intelligent. But think you’ve misinterpreted what I’m saying. 

My point is that if schools are purely academic, and want to know you can succeed at university level, I just don’t understand how someone with a proven track record of academic success at undergraduate AND postgraduate is somehow LESS competitive than a 17 year old with just predicated high school grades? I am well aware you can’t compare high school in the UK with the North America. I moved to Canada for my undergraduate and had my first year waived because of A-levels. But she isn’t applying to get school here with US high school - she’s applying with a Bachelors and a Masters already in the bag. Surely - from a purely academic standpoint - an A in science courses across undergrad and an A at her postgrad would be far more indicative of academic success than a 17 year old with just 3 A-levels, which are at a lower level than either university degree? That’s what I’m trying to say. If we’re talking academics only. Let alone all the other things! 

Did you go to an AVMA accredited school? My understanding from this thread is that they are significantly more competitive than non-AVMA schools (and then board exams/process). How are you finding the process for getting accredited to be able to practice in the US/Canada? From the vets she has known who have gone through it, she was put off from non-AVMA schools because she’s seen what a hassle it is. But maybe she’s mistaken?No, it wasn’t required for any schools this year. Her score put her in the top 5% in previous years, as well.Yeah possibly!

You can have average measurements for a normal heart, left atrium etc. but with such wide variety between breeds and individuals, it makes more sense to compare pulmonary vessels to the width of the ribs, or heart size to the vertebrae.

If things really happened as you describe and the dog had a strong indication for surgery, then your medical director ought to be able see that from the notes and would tell the owners ""lol good luck suing"". But you say that they gave a full refund? Something doesn't add up.

Either way, your MD should definitely have asked you about the case. It's always super important to get the vet's perspective in these kind of cases, so why did they not? Is there any bad blood between you? As I said, the information seems incomplete.This is like the most common feeling in the world when you're just starting out. In fact you should feel that way. It helps keep you from making mistakes.

The most important thing for a new grad is to have a solid support network where you work. Nurses who know their stuff are worth their weight in gold, and a mentor or senior vet is pretty much mandatory. Don't worry about asking questions - we've all been there. If I have a new grad working with me I'd rather they ask things all the time than make mistakes all the time.Gradually transitioning before and after definitely helps. A reasonable clinic would give you at least a couple of days off prior in order to transition to staying up during the night. Coffee probably helps too but I don't drink that. I used to go 7+ nights in a row regularly, but thankfully my new hospital has a lot fewer nights on rotation.

It is rough, bit there's also something unique and almost serene about nights too. Plus you get to meet the most interesting staff in the hospital and bond with them on a deep level, so it's not all bad :)As a fellow left-handed person, doing surgery with right-handed instruments is annoying but definitely possible, and something I got used to pretty quickly. Back when I looked into it I couldn't find any specific left-handed instruments, but that was a few years back in the UK.Coming from a different country, the claims that vets are underpaid is pretty silly from my perspective. I make the equivalent of $49k which is considered a fairly good salary for a non-specialised vet, so when I see vets making twice that just starting out (plus production however much that is) it does sound weird.

But then I remember that the average student debt for vets in the US is almost triple mine and I don't need to pay for health insurance etc. So it probably evens out. However when I see people bringing in claims of 200-300k/year with some experience, the idea of being underpaid kinda falls flat regardless.In your specific example, there is a big difference between overuse of metronidazole vs overuse of prazosin, with regard to the possibility of antibiotic resistance development. If you're going to compare the two you will be at a disadvantage for this reason alone.I would definitely consider Levetiracetam to control secondary seizures in PSS cases while awaiting surgery though.Funny question to ask here 😂

But in today's computers you really want 16Gb minimum. Unfortunately ram upgrades (or any upgrades) on macbooks are way over prized compared to what you get for it (we're talking several hundred dollars for something that should cost like 30 dollars). 

I do come from a background of using a computer for more advanced programs and games, so for your most basic stuff 8Gb is probably enough, however even browsing the Internet uses up a lot of ram these days.If a hematoma develops 2.5 weeks after surgery then it wasn't because the surgery was done badly.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

WarrenTheWarren,"So, just to be clear, you want to route all of your home's outgoing traffic through a Myst node for anonymity  reasons?

Edit: The reason doesn't really matter. I just want to make sure I understand which direction the traffic is going. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5bhixa/  OK, so the short answer is I think you can run a myst node and pi hole on the same computer, although I doubt you will what you really want out of it.

Pi hole blocks ads by acting as a DNS server. When you want to go to [google.com](https://google.com) or something, the first thing your browser does is ask your DNS server to figure out the numerical IP address of that website. In the case of pi hole, it keeps a list of ad websites so when your browser asks for one of those sites, pi hole returns an IP address that basically points to nothing.

A VPN server acts as an entry point to a network from the outside world. In this case, your myst node is acting as a VPN server that takes a connection in, and sends it right back out again. That way someone else's traffic looks like it's coming from your house. So connecting to your own myst node will just make YOUR traffic look like its coming from YOUR house (which it probably is). So in that way you are just spinning your wheels.

So the pi hole and myst functions are really different, and could probably be run on the same machine because they are doing different things. Now what you could (probably) do is run the Mysterium VPN client on the pi hole machine and try to get your household traffic to be routed through that client. BUT you would be using that client to connect to someone else's node, not your own. And that means you are paying MYST for all of your traffic, which is probably not ideal.

I hope that makes sense.

&#x200B;

EDIT:

I was assuming that your pi-hole/myst setup would be at your home. If you are hosting them somewhere else, then I guess it would make sense to connect to your own myst node... but still don't do that. You will end up paying more MYST than its worth. It would be better to just run openVPN or something on that server for free. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5bmc8s/  Depending on the use case it might even make sense to set up a SOCKS proxy rather than a full VPN. No extra software is required, just a modified SSH command (ssh -D PORT HOST) and then telling your computer to connect via the specified port number. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5cgut8/  Yeah, running the myst node wont hurt anything, but it's not what you would want to do for your personal VPN. So run it if you want to earn MYST, not if you want a VPN. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5cgaeh/  Because a myst node is more like a traffic relay rather than a secure connection to his home network. Of course he can run a myst node, but if he has full control of the server, he would do better to use openVPN directly for a secure connection or setting up a proxy if he just wants traffic to appear to come from his home.

The benefit of myst really comes in when you want your traffic to come from a source that is completely unrelated to you or your current location. Setting it up so the traffic you generate while at starbucks looks like its coming from your home is really a strange thing to do. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/u701v2/dumb_late_night_question_relating_to_vpn_pihole/i5clpwv/  It's a bit messier than a nice export button, but you can get a JSON report of your session history by going to this URL:

Popular_Hour6343,"I didn't know. Someone randomly mentioned vet school in convo and I never considered it until then (after 1st year of undergrad). I decided to job shadow that summer (4 months) and get a feel for it. Looking back, I wasn't really exposed to a whole lot but generally I enjoyed my time job shadowing. 

I pursued vet school, got in, started, and thats where i really started to ask myself if this is what I want to do. I started to wonder if I can actually do this, if I'm cut out for it, if I'm actually going to be able to enjoy it, because its one thing to watch a vet work, but a whole other thing to be the vet working. 

Anyways, I just went with the flow of things hoping that I can do it and I would enjoy it, and when i got to my clinical year, that's when I knew. A big part of the doubt was having confidence to do the things that vets do, and basically the more exposure and practice I got, the more my confidence built and the more I was able to enjoy the work.No you're not, I'm from Canada and went to Melbourne for vet school, my grades weren't good enough for the schools in Canada and the states. It's not selling yourself short, it's just being realistic about your opportunities for success. Look at Australia, not sure how tuition compares to island schools, but with the conversion it was cheaper than the states. Check out oztrekk.Recently graduated from unimelb, most of my classmates (the ones that shared their salaries) earn between 70-85k. One of my friends found a job in Sydney at a private clinic (smallies) offering 100k. Don't sell yourself short. If I were still there I wouldn't accept an offer less than 90. Ideally 100+.Yeah fair point. Whichever clinic I chose would depend on salary, support, mentorship, hours, distance, and etc. If all the other factors are ideal, I wouldn't mind a lower salary, but depends how low. Disposable income is really important to me, especially around this range. The minimum I'd expect is mainly for me to live some what comfortably. So honestly I'd try to find another offer if it was <90k regardless of the other factors. And yeah there is pressure to produce, but even at 100k, you should be able to produce 5x times that if it's a well managed clinic, especially if you're keen to do surgeries and dentals.I'm a new grad from Canada, about to write my navle soon, but tbh I don't even look at jobs that don't post a salary, if I get desperate then maybe.I job shadowed for the first time when I was 19 and I didn't take any notes. Now 27, I don't remember anything from my job shadowing experience except for the overall feelings of the experience (which I think should be the focus so early in your schooling)

If you're consistently involved with a vet through the years, you'll naturally learn a lot through repetition without having to write anything down. 

You still have the rest of high-school, 4 years of undergrad, and then 4 years of vet school, I wouldn't bother taking any notes now, I think most vets would understand that. That being said, take a note pad and if you're interested in something, make a note and look it up at home. Have fun job-shadowing!One of my friends got her results on NEBThe fact that I wasn't really inspired by anything else.  I thought about medicine but despite the fat salary, the long difficult journey didn't seem worth it to me.

tortoisetortellini,"You definitely can do mixed practice! Locations are mostly rural. So as long as youre willing to go where the work is, you'll be fine.


Specialisation is A LOT of work. You need to do (usually) an internship and a residency. The pay is shite for these years. I'm not a specialist but all the specialists I know say they will never make up for the lost income during those years while they could have been earning as an associate vet.


As everyone else has said, slow down! You will experience so much in vet school & many people find they are interested in something completely different than they originally thought. I personally always thought I wanted to do exotics, until 6 months before the end of my DVM - when I did a few weeks of emergency placement. Now I'm in emergency and couldn't imagine myself anywhere else. Good luck!do you have any experience in vet med or with animals?

you said you graduated in 2020, what have you been doing the last 3 years? what kinds of transferrable skills do you have?


volunteering/shadowing experience is usually necessary - vet med is a very unique industry and employers want to know that you have a realistic understanding of the job (lots of customer service, trauma and gore, abuse from clients and the media, euthanasia, very few opportunities to cuddle cute puppies, etc.) before investing in yougood pay, good hrs and scheduled breaks, you pay for my cpdyepbulk bandaids for when your cat gets a swipe in 😅 nah, a thank you card or a good google review is enough, honestly. Or gift card to a local coffee shop!Sounds like she needs to re-take some core undergrad biology units to up her grades in that area. The MSc doesn't make up for that unfortunately.
Also have a really good look at requirements for each school - some schools have limitations on how long ago a course was completed, and what their core requirements are (eg. I needed 2 units of biochem as well biology within the past 5 years). MOST schools require a BSc., possibly the BA is what's not meeting standards (unless she did BSc before the MSc)


Being older can also be an advantage - I know for Australian schools being older than 25 (""mature age student"") gives you an extra point towards your application.


In terms of schools to apply to, she probably needs to be realistic about where she'd actually go.  If she's not willing to move away from you then don't waste energy on applications to places like Sydney. If she's willing to move, but not ready - take a break from applying until you're in a position to move or apply to places that allow you to defer your offer for 12 months, like JCU in Queensland. If she is willing to move to another country, she might have to settle with the fact that she might not get into an accreditated school & need to take registration exams after graduating to work where she wants.novelty scrub cap?this is very funnyThe uni has some small scholarships through the scholarships page, and you can also get a 5k interest free loan, but in terms of scholarships big enough to cover the fees there's very little.

etherunit07,"Hello,

Thanks for posting this issue here! I will try to elaborate it in more details.

Firstly, your description about connection failed status is correct, if our monitoring agent (instances checking node accessibility and ability to transfer data) is failing to establish a p2p connection or exchange data packets via VPN tunnel, then it marks node as connection failed on your dashboard. As a result, your service proposals becomes unavailable to our discovery service responsible for announcing proposals to the network participants meaning no usage and tokens in payment.

Usually, with help of node logs our team helps to reconfigure host network in the way it starts working but thats again a highly dependant on your network setup capabilities.

From the first glance at this situation, it looks like traffic is failing to traverse with use of UDP hole punching to your VMs at Proxmox resulting in such outcome. 

There might several reasons behind and anyway it would require more details to locate this problem better. 

Since I know your current setup, I'll try to reproduce it with similar condition.

BTW, can you please specify your Github issue number if possible? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/1035ypu/connection_failed/j31j7iw/  Thank you.

It is cool that you can record the ecg findings / sounds, allowing you to show clients / let them hear the murmur.

Currently in a year long rotating internship getting 50k a year, but already accepted my job offer for next year of urgent care/GP (2 days urgent care, 1 day GP, 1 day surgeries), 130k base with 22% production. 18 days PTO/sick days, don't remember CE allowance off the top of my headWhy would it be weird? My generation grew up with a TV character named Hunter... So I see a lot of kids named Hunter.. it's just a name. Doesn't mean they will come out of the womb looking for deer and rabbits to shoot...The only ""hospice"" vets are like people who work for Lap of Love which is a home euthanasia service. They also occasionally help with hospice type care. 

Other things to consider is maybe like pain management and rehabilitation? We have an anesthesiologist who also has his own rehab/pain management services and he works with many people on just helping control older dogs pain so that they can be comfortable without invasive procedures.Im an intern with only a few externships and different options through school… but i can tell you what i like (due to outcome).

a) autoligation if small enough, but will also do a straight forward spay with millers if its a fat/adult cat.

b) scrotal

b?) dog spay - modified millers on all (pedicles and uterin body with a transfixing on the body if its a large dog or older dog)

c) any dog neuter - kind of scrotal but through the septum - ive found it limits hematoma formation but its really a shelter style and have not seen this through any GP

nickie305,"Food and a five star review!!!I think this is a good offer but you should always counter anyway. The worst they can say is no lol. This is my personal opinion on what I would recommend asking for.
- Ask for 20 days (5 weeks) PTO
- 3k for continuing education, plus extra PTO days to use for CE as you should not have to use your off time for this. 
- Ask for specifics on what the mentorship structure will look like
- Usually a sign-on bonus will be tied to agreeing to work for the company for x number of years or you will have to pay it all back. Do not agree to this, a lot of my friends got trapped because of this. You should negotiate for paying back a prorated amount if you leave before 1 year of employment.
 - Read the non-compete carefully. It will depend where you live but I do not recommend agreeing to anything more restrictive than 1 year and a 3 mile radius. Even better if you can get them to drop it completely. 
- Ask for coverage/ reimbursement for licensing fees (NAVLE, state license, DEA license)
- Ask for reimbursement for PLIT, VIN membership, AVMA/ local association memberships, JAVMA, Plumbs, and whatever other resources you’d likeIt’s not uncommon to not give out estimates over the phone.

hs5280,"Vetmed is a team sport. I’ve worked with doctors I don’t necessarily trust fully but that doesn’t mean I’d be rude to them. I’m a support for them and I do what I can to help their confidence. How are we going to improve the mental health of the doctors and techs in this field if we continue to talk to each other like that? From day one it’s a learning process and we never stop!Tech at a veg in New Jersey here. Fresh out of school, you’ll be in the “new er doctor” program and if you’re willing to devote your life to it short term, and you love ER work and surgery, you’ll probably like it. Doctors work 12 hour shifts, but does anyone ever leave on time - probably not. I believe the current contracts are 12 shifts per month. Doctors rotate so you’ll have day, swing, and night shifts. 

It’s kind of location dependent about how you’ll be treated by current staff, what your mentors will be like, how hard you have to go into the cult stuff, etc. Ive seen some new doctors say “nope” early on, and I’ve seen some grow into amazing doctors who can run an ER floor like a boss. 

The fact that we don’t take people away from their pets is something that really doesn’t change much of what you do. I know a lot of people are reticent to practice that way, but it really keeps them calmer not having to wait outside for the most part. And when an animal does better away from their family, you have every right to say so. 

If you end up with veg, when you get there trust your support staff. They’re well trained and can guide you through the hospital specific things that the overarching cult indoctrination doesn’t give.As far as practicing medicine the way you want, there’s a lot of autonomy once you’re on your own as a solo doctor. There’s also a lot of resources to confer with others when you get a mystery on your hands.It’s hard because some hospitals are super toxic despite the facade of an amazing culture. Some of them truly have people that don’t bring toxicity to the table. A lot of the anti veg feelings out there that aren’t about the open concept are about the cult vibes. You’re absolutely joining a cult when you join veg. You just have to figure out how much of that aspect you’re going to participate in. 

It’s only emergency so our job in a case that belongs in specialty is to stabilize and facilitate a transfer. Sometimes that gets sticky because the family doesn’t want to go to specialty, or (rarely) the doctor tries to handle something outside the scope of ER-only. That’s another big point of contention out there. I’ve personally begged cases that needed internal med to go to specialty a mile down the road and they won’t go. 

The more corporate and huge the company becomes, the more divisive it will be. You’ll hear from people in all positions how horrible it was and also how great it is. The toughest part of coming in as a new grad is you really don’t know where you’ll end up full time. So the advice to get to know the hospital is only useful up to a point.  

As someone who has watched many baby doctors grow and learn, I do think it’s something to try while you’re young. I don’t think many people start out in ER after school and stay their entire careers. My body is breaking down after less than 4 years as a nurse (I started in my 40s lol). So if you have the itch to do ER, do it with veg or someone else while your body can still stay up all night! 

Oh and veg doesn’t have non competes so you can jump ship without that looming over you if it turns out to be not a good fit. 

Rambling on my day off lol sorry. There’s a lot I wish y’all knew before coming on board so I’m trying to be that personThere’s probably a lot going on in Doctorland that I don’t even know about.

thenoobient,"Hi, thanks for the responses. Let me answer, too.

Ports: like I mentioned, there's no documentation whatsoever. I don't really understand how you consider those ""strong points"". Port 4449 is not once explained. I can obviously figure out it's the web UI port since somewhere on the site it instructs me to open http://ip:4449, but that's it, it's just some implicit information. Regarding those ""UDP ports"", there's also zero explanation, just that ""you should open them"". What range? No info. What are they for? No info. And the rest of those ports that the Myst daemon listens on, again, zero docs. How is that a strong point? And how do I verify my node is working? Because that ""Test"" function on the website definitely doesn't help much...

Firewall: I think here might be some misunderstanding. I'm not talking about my router's firewall, I'm talking about the firewall of the OS that runs Myst. The server itself runs in the cloud at a VPS provider. There's no ""UPnP"" involved as there's no NAT either. There's only firewalld, which won't open ports on its own. And I can't really accept the ""this is for home users"" argument, as the Onboarding page clearly has a dedicated section for _data centers_. And obviously I've been talking about that very scenario.

Purchase: I know the purchase itself is on a separate site, **but** that site is redirecting to your unsecured instance upon completion. Which, again, due to lack of domain name or HTTPS, is completely unreliable. Also what I mentioned, it couldn't even credit my purchase due to some random (undocumented) port not being open. It only credited my MYST the moment I disabled the firewall. Till then, it showed ""0.00000 MYST"" or something. I really don't think managing payments and credit cards should be done via your freshly installed Myst node.

Deb: again, if the project (also) aims for the data center, this argument isn't really valid. Either support the data center, or don't :) And yes, I know, I can run Docker in an EL VM, and map ports, and mount volumes to make a non-persistent construct somewhat persistent, I just fail to see the point. Building an RPM is not harder than building a DEB. Been there, done that :) ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/hzzgp3a/  Uh, don't wanna sound rude, but WireGuard uses whatever port you tell it to use. In fact, as per recently, there wasn't even a default port, just pick whatever you want. Yes, I've been deploying WireGuard servers on my own, in fact, I even developed management scripts and Ansible playbooks for it.

On top of that, Mysterium is more than just a WireGuard server with a different name, so the WireGuard docs will most certainly not tell me what Myst is doing on ports 1900, 5353, 11253, 5353, 4050, 4449, and 36317. These are NOT documented in your docs, period. This is the 3rd time in this post I've been told it's well documented, but I can only repeat myself: it's not well documented, it's nod even badly documented, it's just not documented _at all_. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/ta74bq/node_security_is_ridiculous/i08769o/  I'm sorry, but apparently you don't know how online CC payments work. When you make a credit card purchase, the payment processor **does** send back data to the merchant. How else would the merchant know if the payment was successful or not? The payment processor will most definitely **not** top up your crypto balances or whatnot, they charge your card with the amount specified by the merchant, tell the merchant if the charge was successful or not, and then it's up to the merchant to do whatever they want that info.

elchemy,"Just chickens working out the pecking order - nurses have their own insecurities and a new vet is a chance for them to feel at the top of the totem pole for a little while.  
This is childish unprofessional behaviour that isn't welcome in the workplace, so talk to the owner about the problem.I'd be speaking to an employment lawyer, and also documenting all conversations now, and emailing it to yourself for the record.In Australia all veterinarians are qualified to take and use xrays. What you're describing is a specialist application of radiology - you'd likely get the most exposure to this and radiotherapy in a specialist centre doing a lot of oncology.  
There is plenty of opportunity for vets with specialised radiology skills especially in the newer imaging modalities like MRI, CT etc - basically you want to specialise as a radiologist.Depends on the practice.   
But mostly they are segregated - you can find a large mixed practice but the chance of them doing enough of the very specialised work you want is low.  
Vets can do anything but most are doing smallies or equine as a focus. Specialising is becoming the norm.Yes, you never have perfect information, so often in retrospect you might do things differently, but even more often you never even find out the true history, diagnosis and best treatment.  
Tolerance for ambiguity is a core skill to be a vet IMO.  


It's hard to kill an animal during a spey or other routine procedure, but it does happen (usually combination of minor errors) and feels really crappy - definitely one of the downsides of the career choice.It's much easier to go straight into clinical practice while your studies are fresh in your memory.

Further, you've got little knowledge of ""real world"" vet practice as a student, so I'd be more concerned about the lack of practical vet skills and experience you bring to the PH role.

Personally I found it vital to spend a few years in practice to ground my knowledge in clinical practice.

I did an undergrad research year ([B.Sc.Vet](https://B.Sc.Vet)) which was like doing a masters or similar, but my lack of clinical knowledge made me feel pretty out of my depth - would prefer to have done it post grad in retrospect - I feel like a PH career would have similar considerations.  


Personally I think the risk of being a theoretical academic who is out of touch of reality is real and someting to be avoidedIt's great you've developed a tool to help improve your consulting and history taking.

I'd encourage you to use it, and just mention ""I'll take notes as we go so I don't miss anything important"" - 90% of owners will be impressed and happy with this - one of the most common complaints of vets/doctors is they didn't listen or didn't properly examine the animal.  


If you stick to a standard routine you'll soon learn it by heart and may be able to do more of this ""in your head"" but taking notes of key findings is a great idea at any stage of your career.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

VaranusCinerus,"I can answer a couple things-
Cost is prohibitive and honestly $25-50 per user would depend on the clinic; ie how many staff? What is their average profit to work with? A small family owned clinic is going to have less to work with per employee than a larger facility. 

Also - we switched at my place and despite all the troubleshooting... we had issues with various things. For example ALL avian patients ended up with no species - it deleted all species and age info for avians as they were input differently. Any labwork also didn't get changed over that had been uploaded.Yeah it's extremely subpar and why our management put off switching until it became absolutely necessary when we went fully paperless- the old system just.. wasn't set up for it
I am the one uploading all the old files at my practice, and it is at the point I am manually updating all the avian accounts as I upload, and if owners need an appt before I get to their file we have to explain the issue and ask them the needed info, as there was no other fix- and this takes so much time I could be using for actual animal care and helping the techs and assistants more, but is critical to have patient info correct 

If you are able to make something better, that would not be cripplingly expensive & works better than those on market I would expect some success after it's proven to work at the first batch of places but definitely would have to find clinics willing to hear you out and try first - would advise you try to start by either lunch&learns when you are ready to sell as that is what the ones we have used do, or looking into veterinary expos to get the word out once you have something together.","Veterinarian.

They sold their practices to PEs because they were the only buyers, only to discover they sold their souls to the profit devil.  The model is focused on profits for investors not patient care (though that is stated goal).  The bureaucratic nightmare that is corporate medicine and insurance is steam rolling our way.

JonLivingston2020,"I'm a Ph.D. neuroscientist with a serious interest in medical matters and comfortable with terminology.   I research my pets' conditions carefully and observe their behavior closely.  I don't tell a doc or vet about my education or what I have done for a living.   That said, both docs & vets pretty much pick up on it the moment I start speaking.  I can tell by their demeanor.  Maybe once or twice I've had someone talk to me in a way that felt patronizing, but most speak to me as an equal and I appreciate that.That's a toxic and disrespectful environment if you ask me.   Having the rudeness to actually say such things to your face?  Even if they were true, and they obviously are not. 

You either need to quit or to come up with some snappy come backs that will put them in their place.   Maybe it's a weird initiation rite of some kind.  Inappropriate but things like that do happen.Interesting to note that this is getting worse at a time when something like 80% of veterinarians are female.  At least, where I live.It may have nothing to do with it.   Your supposition appears to be that I'm claiming the abusers are female.   IMO it could go either way, but if significant numbers are, then it would argue against the claim made for years, that if women were in charge of the world everything would be sunshine & bunny rabbits.  OR ... if it turns out that women are predominantly the victims and the abusers are the last holdouts of the previous generation (mostly male) then that would merit a big write up in the NYT at the very least.Maybe learn radiology.   If I were younger I'd do that career now.The best thing a witness can do is dial 911 and let the pros handle it. 

If were a super emergency, such as a fire, I would run in and try to get a person out or douse the fire.  But the pro's would rather people not help if possible because you might give them another injury to deal with.Is your practice flooded with clients?   Seems all of them are in my area and that's got to be stressful.You might enjoy reading an old classic:  ""All Creatures Great & Small"" about a young vet who takes a position with a crusty rural vet in England.   You are experiencing what all professionally trained people do.  I have a Ph.D. in neuroscience and oscillate between thinking I'm the smartest person in the room and being convinced I'm a hopeless loser.  It comes with the territory, when a person has high standards.   Just breathe & take it one day at a time.YesYes that is terrible.  In my area where cost of living is high, tech positions are being advertised at $19-$30 per hour.   I paid a software programming intern $30/hour back in 2006.    And techs are so important to the whole client experience (moreso these days when most vets do the entire workup behind closed doors and only speak to the client for 10 minutes at the end).Still, it's unfair.   Software programmers with undergrad degrees start at $130k in high tech.   Less education and far less importance in my view.   Vets should get more, but the problem is the business model.  Human medicine is underwritten by a vast insurance network & massive government subsidies.   High tech is flying high on sales.  Both have $$$ to burn.  Vets depend alnost 100% on a client paying their bill.  I'm sorry that's the case.  Pet insurance is not underwritten by employers and far too expensive for most people.Well I hope you get it and I hope you receive the appreciation you deserve as well.  :)Your answer makes no sense.  I did not say ""vet med is far less important"" I said it's more important.   Yo.

the premise is faulty; it implies they aren't in control of their future, and that mental health is an external forcing being exerted upon them. it's not 'wrong' it's just counterproductive, because these things must come from within...not Reddit. plenty of people make it just fine, like you said - that was the point of my post. call it 'rude' but the one thing we Americans need is perspective when we feel like taking the victim routeyou got into the gig, you knew the stats, you are the only one who can motivate yourself, and of course people kill themselves all the time in every field for silly reasons; the USA is a drugged-up place with a very strange culture of victimhood at times. everyone else is going to pat you on the back - i'll take the downvotes for saying: Mental Health isn't an external thing, you don't need meds, you just need to watch less Netflix and exercise 20 mins a day and get some sunshine/vitamin D3/K2 and 8 hours of good sleep. there are people in Somalia escaping atrocities and we're over here in the West worried about if we'll 'make it through okay' as an upperclass doctorate-program student.","Other.

fishoutofwater1000,"Can anyone who passed please provide some insight on what worked best for them. I had done most of vet prep and the ICVA practice exams and felt relatively ok going into the exam. I found the exam was so random compared to what I studied. What are the chances the NEB results that were briefly shown weren’t accurate? To the people who find out they didn’t pass, would anyone be interested in starting a virtual study group for April rounds maybe? I completed 80% of vet prep, but when I log into vet prep now it says my subscription has expired and to renew I have to pay. NAVLE results from today (on NEB) tell me I failed, so how do I go about renewing it for free?Anyone have a good resource for pharmacology, or something that helped with knowing the drugs that came up on NAVLE?They won’t show us the exam questions though.

HumorBrilliant3705,"4th year student at another vet school and it’s like that here also. The only department surprisingly that isn’t like this at our school is the emergency/ICU department but probably bc all of the other departments abuse them so badly, they’d never dish that out onto others. Not sure if it’s like this at other schools, but our surgery department is particularly bad. All of the clinicians and residents will outwardly talk about students and/or each other and it’s just so nasty. I can’t wait to graduate and never look back. I spent 2 weeks on externship at the clinic I ended up signing with and it was such a breath of fresh air to be around people that loved their job and weren’t so miserable. Hang in there, but continue to use your voice!! Unfortunately, most people that end up in academia are ego-centric very brilliant big brains. If more people like us that actually care about treating people like actual human beings went into specializing, maybe the environment would be different. But, alas, because of the abuse we have endured, we refuse to specialize. At least, that’s the case for me.

PS: I stopped reading evals soon after starting clinics after getting an evaluation telling me to “talk more” because I wouldn’t joke around with the clinicians much despite always answering questions in rounds and asking my own questions to help with my learning. It’s all a load of shit.Also a 2024 new grad! SA GP practice in TN 130k base salary, 21% production, 15 days PTO, $3500 CE, 20k sign on bonus with 6 months mentorship. Will be working 8 hour shifts, 4 days a week. 2hr lunch breaks however so I guess it’s more like 6 hour shifts.For sure! Granted, I’ll most likely spend 1 of those hours doing callbacks and working on paperwork but at least it gives me another actual hour to myself!I do not suggest buying VetPrep as a 1st or 2nd year. It’s very expensive and then you would have to buy it again when it’s time to actually take the NAVLE. You’re still very fresh and new to vet school and many of the topics on VetPrep will go over your head at this stage in your education. Your class notes and labs are enough to study right now. However, you can sign up for the VetPrep question of the day email subscription if you’d like to know what the questions look like before purchasing at the end of your 3rd year.Small animal GP!I used VetPrep and only got ~40% through it, but I did go through all of the powerpages twice and watched every single powerlecture at least once. After my first self assessment (I did 2 and my 2nd one’s high end was very close to my score), I saw I needed to do better on my feline and equine questions, so I spent 2 weeks studying powerpages and powerlectures and comparing them to my class notes to fill in any gaps for equine and cats. During those 2 weeks, I just did practice questions for all other species. Then I spent 2 more weeks on cats and reviewed dogs at the same time. Then I spent 2 weeks on bovine and reviewed horses at the same time. I mainly focused on the big 4 categories. Then the last 2 weeks I had of studying, I integrated exotics, pigs, poultry, and miscellaneous stuff like how to calculate sensitivity and specificity etc. into my study plan but continued to review the big 4 via questions and powerpages. Now, for these 8 weeks, I was on externships, electives, or off so I had a LOT of time to study (~5-8 hours a day). Another tid bit: my 2nd year I started to have crippling test anxiety where I would just freeze up and forget things, so I’ve been on medication for that ever since. If you feel it’s not just the way you studied but the way you take the exam, no shame in talking to a doctor for some medical help! Hope this was insightful and good luck!!!","Veterinarian.

Weasle189,"We actually have both. We have idexx catalyst one , an Abaxis HM 5 (hematology) and an Abaxis vetscan VS2. 


The zoetis (VS2) tests run cheaper and they replace faulty disks so it works out well for the chemistry so long as you have a good rep, we also like that alot of the profiles have electrolytes included rather than separate (clients prefer to pay for one test vs two). The HM5 has a lot of maintenance (running blanks, wash head cleaning and soak cleaning) , if you are running less than 5 tests a day on average I would say it's not worth it and rather get the idexx machine, it also throws a lot of errors on IMHA dogs so those often need a blood smear and manual hct anyway. 


The big advantage of the idexx catalyst one machine is you can run individual slides. We like using just bun/crea to monitor chronic kidney failure and Alkp and Alt to monitor liver cases. It saves a lot of money and makes clients more compliant with follow-up testing. It's also nice to have individual slides if you need to do dilutions for a specific test, usually creatinine (we usually assume if it's too high to read the actual value is irrelevant but there are others that like that option). They are also regularly bringing out new slides and research (waiting on cortisol for Addison's and Cushing's dogs at the moment, rep says in the next year or two)

Ecstatic-Method-17,"I completely know how you feel. My whole life it has been animals and becoming a veterinarian but somewhere along the way I guess in high school I lost that confidence and gained more self doubt. I guess when we are little all we see is the excitement of the career and as we get older the feelings of self doubt, lack of confidence, and all the facts about what it means to pursue this career really hits us. I’m 21 now but straight out of high school I went into an Early childhood degree and then in this last year switched to psychology but in these last 4 months I decided to really be true to myself and listen to my gut about being a veterinarian. It came down to being more scared about pursuing a career I wasn’t truly passionate about compared to pursuing the competitive field I was very passionate about. There will be struggles in our futures no matter what career we choose yes vet met comes with many but that passion and gut feeling we feel is there for a reason and we need to listen to it. When it comes down to it it’s not really just about the question of can I do it because honestly and truly we can all do anything we put our minds to. The question is how do you see your future when you are going through the ups and downs in life that are bound to happen. Do you see yourself coming home from work as a veterinarian even though it was a hard day you will be proud of the work or do you see yourself coming home from a job that may not completely fulfill you. Also looking at the bigger picture and diving deeper you need to see why you struggle with that confidence and self doubt just as I do. Somewhere along the way we started doubting ourselves and now we can either continue with those self limiting beliefs or we can prove to ourselves that we can do this. Try to build your confidence day by day by accomplishing the little things for me it’s been keeping active. I’ve been able to prove to myself that I can stick to a routine and it feels good which in turn has been giving me more confidence and allowing me to doubt myself less. You can do it I have complete faith in you and you should have faith in yourself too!! Work on your confidence and push out those self limiting beliefs.

christropy,"If that one tech is only calling you by your first name out of disrespect, I'd have a chat with her and the owner.  It's fine if they want to be disrespectful quietly until I can gain their confidence but I 100% do not tolerate outright disrespect.  

They are not only not trusting you, they're trying to see where your boundaries are.  You need to be strong and explain that how you want to be referred to.  

Also, it sounds like they're kinda being dicks.  This is why most new doctors leave their first clinic within 1-2 years.Every vet clinic is incredibly different.  The owner sets the tone for the place and everyone kinda follows suit.  If the techs feel comfortable being this rude, don't plan to stay.  I'd personally start looking for a different clinic, even if it's a bit further away, and just not mention this one.  Then when you're leaving, explain why you're leaving.  You can try to work it out but it sounds like it's not worth the effort.  There are better places out there.Ill toss my hat in.  I've made some depressing posts before but I will say this, I'd rather be a vet than not a vet.  If I could redo things, I might have chosen ophthalmology or something a little simpler.  My ophthalmologist works 9-5pm, leaves on time, and makes 2x as much as I do.  However I also get to do cool ass surgeries, save people's pets who can be their entire world, and I have a lot of flexibility in where I work and how I want to work.  Veterinary medicine is incredibly hard though so be prepared for that.  I always point out to my brothers who are computer programmers that they don't have a website dedicated to preventing suicide of computer engineers.  :\I'm a general practitioner so I'm not sure, sorry...With the inability to find new grads, they're likely giving you a high offer and this is pretty good - better than my current job and I've been out for 7 years.  

I think the only things I would worry about is how hard the 4 days would be, is it a no compete, and what the mentorship would really look like?

I think the prevailing belief is if someone is asking for the moon, they better perform well.  However this is a corporation - so if you're not doing well, I'm sure they won't be afraid to let you go.

Do some research into other practices in the area?   Use glassdoor?Brah, I graduated from school in 2016, Rossie who had to do clinics at Purdue and that place lives rent free in my mind unfortunately.  I rarely think about it now but I had to have a full blown mental breakdown to change my attitude into something they wanted.  It worked, I became bitter, mean, and short with everyone... which they translated into confident, leadership, and gets the work done.  I still have my reviews from there, scanned, and in a folder deep in my DVM folder.  I really should delete them.  

Anyways, I feel you. I hear you.  Just do what they want and if you get a passing grade, move on and don't read the reviews imo.  When you get out, no one cares what you do as long as it's not gross negligence.  Not saying you should practice bad medicine but the pressure will be relieved eventually.It's been 7 years so maybe things have changed?  Just keep your head down, prepare like crazy, and you'll likely be okay.  I mean, it's going to be hell.  But it's only 1 year, then you're free forever.You know, I think if I could've given myself some advice prior to arriving, I would've just warned myself that I was going to be tossed to the wolves.  I showed up in the middle of the clinical year for the Purdue students and although they say they give the necessary consideration for new Rossies... they did not.  I was put in Orthopedics and basically told to setup an ICU sheet for my patient.  I didn't even know where the ICU was.  The other students tried to help me but it was clear the clinician felt I was getting too much help.  So I guess what I'd say is try and request to be put on a simpler rotation like radiology or something and if that doesn't work, research the fuck about whatever case you take, act confident, and hope you look good.Ya, I really struggled there.  They actually ordered me into therapy and I remember walking in and sitting down.  The therapist asked me if I was having a problem with a specific person.  I just uttered the teacher's name and she was like... right... you're not the first to have an issue with him.  The guy has moved on but he was a right dick.You're preaching to the choir.  However the idea that a student can make any major changes is highly unlikely.  So I was giving realistic advice for anyone heading to Purdue.  It's not okay but this is the world we live in.Honestly it's for the best.  I'm being pushed around as well and it's like everything is so positive.  We get stuck in our places so there's definitely better things out there.  Fuck Banfield.  Fuck the corps.I have to deal with my stupid ass manager who's the boss's son.  He acts like he's smart but he's really actually pretty retarded and stubborn.  I have to deal with the favorite staff he has who should've been let go a long time ago but they're kept around.  They know they're favorites and so they work less and basically make life harder for everyone.  The staff I have that are really amazing are paid poorly and on top of that, watch these these other folks hide and slack and do nothing while they carry their load.  I had an argument with my manager today about how he should provide compensation for my meals while I was at CE.  He said my license was my responsibility so why should he pay for it?  He has no clue every other job takes care of it.  I have a lot of clients and staff I really value but I feel more and more pushed out.  I don't want to go to another clinic because frankly it's hard to adjust to a different set of rules.  

The customers are so rude sometimes.  One bad attitude ruins the morning.  I was the only doctor at the clinic until 10:30am this morning because the other two had doctor appointments.  I had to euthanize a kitten, an aggressive but otherwise healthy dog, and deal with some critical cases.  A lady who came in for vaccines said I was incredibly slow and she was never coming back.  Fine, get the fuck out you stupid cunt.  I feel so burned out, I don't even care anymore what most folks thing of me.  I fantasize about dying from natural reasons because I don't want my family to be sad that I committed suicide but I really am tired of my work.  I get paid so much money but I feel it doesn't really balance out the drama I deal with.  

I have 400k+ in debt and I doubt I will ever find a good way to deal with that.  I know plenty of folks who went into trade school or got regular degrees and have so much more money than me.  They usually work from home, get to see their pets all day or kids, and get to complete chores while at home.  I say goodbye to my pets at 8:30am and see them again at 6:30pm.  I then spend a few hours making food, eating food, doing chores, and then a few games or shows before bed.  

I worked in a shelter and it really gave me some serious PTSD.  I can't seem to enjoy a moment anymore because my brain likes to remind me of all the cats in tiny cages at the local shelter being kept in the most stressful condition out there.  Did you know most vets don't really care for cats?  They're all dog people.  So cats generally get a bad rap and are treated more poorly by a lot of professionals.  The shelter I worked at - they would have aggressive dogs that would snap and the staff would be like ""we can save it"" and then they'd have a cat that would growl and they'd be like ""this is worthy of euthansia"".  Heck they even had a board boasting how many cats they euthanized.  They got rid of it but goddamn.  

That kitten I euthanized?  It was doing soooo bad.  Dehydrated and barely able to move.  Owners dropped off expecting me to do what?  I ran diagnostics on my own dime and found it was in acute kidney disease.  If I hadn't done that, it would've suffered for several more days most likely.  

I feel people give me so much love and respect BUT THEN it's like, you're not a real doctor.  Bitch I know more than most MDs.  I work on cardiac cases, cancer cases, surgery, research the weirdest shit.  But the perception that we're not as good will never disappear when most MDs just refer.  Like my own doctor barely tries.  

Another fun fact is there is so much death.  Even if everything goes well, sometimes pets die at age 8 or 10.  So human doctors rarely see a the entire cycle of life, we see it constantly.  And it's exhausting.  

Therapy only goes so far.  A ton of folks I know are on drugs or alcohol to deal with the bad feelings.  

This is a rant because I'm so burned out.  But again, scared to make a move and miserable at my place.That was a definite rant.  I just needed to write it.  And yes, I'm in the process of looking again jobs right now.  I'll be sad to leave some folks but it's time.My friend got into VEG and really liked it and tried to convince me to join.  I went through several interviews and it seemed alright.  I had done relief veterinary shifts on holidays and randomly on weekends so I wasn't really new to the game.  After being told I had the job and I would start with them in a new clinic in NC, they suddenly shifted and told me they had to fire two doctors for not practicing medicine their way and I (and anyone else who wasn't a full time ER doc) was going to have to go through a training program that requires 6 months minimum.  So I decided to talk to the ""training program administrator"" and I could tell the interview was soured in the first 5 minutes.  She didn't like my ""not 100% dedicated to VEG attitude and staying every night forever concerns"".  My friend had told me I would work some nights which was fine but I could also do day shifts pretty quickly.  

So after 1 working interview, a flight to observe a clinic in GA, and 3 phone calls, I was suddenly out.  Really still makes me mad because I was making huge changes to my life to move to VEG.  

Yes, they want the veterinarian to answer every phone call.  They never say ""no"" but they will drain the lifeblood of a client before they start doing free services and then kick them to the regular DVM with no money, and you have to drink the kool-aid.  I predict it will be as wonderful as Banfield - great place for money but you should be prepared to be uncomfortable.I took the NAVLE THREE TIMES.  I nearly passed the first time and I barely studied.  Then I studied really hard and failed it by an even bigger margin.  Then I requested time accommodation because I have ADHD and I passed without a problem.

I struggled with the intense time management and I needed a little help with that.  No one knows this unless I tell them.  No one cares.  You pass the test, you're a veterinarian.  I am built a little differently than other vets and honestly, I think it's to my advantage.  Don't beat yourself up, keep studying, and I'm sure you'll be fine.I don't think there's much I can add but I'd tell you to read up on boundaries.  Boundaries for me at my clinic is that I'm not going to run around with my head chopped off or stay late.  If I can't find a tech, that's a big shame because I guess it's time to chill until someone arrives.  The owner of my clinic and one of the techs who recently graduated both sit by the rooms waiting to take the next one that arrives and I chill in the office.  I'm not jumping through hoops to get into rooms (I'm salary only) and so I know they boast they do more but really it does not matter.  I've worked emergency and I know I can go fast so they're basically wasting money by not using my skills appropriately.  When I started at my clinic, they had a habit of also running bloodwork after anesthesia or gassing my cats down.  I had to learn to put my foot down and demand that the pets get propofol instead of gas, we wait for the bloodwork, and if I'm not comfortable with the procedures, I can do rooms instead.  A lot of these owners will pressure you to conform because that means it's simple for them.  But you need to force them to conform to the practices you learned in school or like everyone else says, just leave and find a place that will welcome you.  There are SOOOO many places that'd die for a veterinarian that's motivated to do better.Chat or did the mentor watch?  I kept getting scrotal hematomas until a senior veterinarian watched me and corrected me on one part.  Then they decreased drastically.Find a therapist early.

Edit: What do you wish someone told you before you went to vet school?
-> I think my mentor said it best.  ""It was the best time in his life and he never wants to do it again"".  It's so intense and fulfilling and difficult that life seems to lack some flavor once you graduate.

What are opportunities you’re glad you took advantage of?
-> I tried shelter work, emergency work, shot clinics, etc.  If they'd have me, I'd try my hand.  It's made me much more rounded and experienced even if I think clinic work is all I want to do.

What opportunities to you wish you had taken advantage of?
-> Don't hesitate to ask for more.  Don't feel bad for others not getting as much as you because you deserve it.I started doing relief work in an emergency clinic near me after I felt a bit more settled on my feet.  It was still difficult and I never really fit into their culture of taking all the money they can and letting animals die if they didn't have the funds.As a doctor, I often have no idea where someone is skill level wise.  Some folks are good as soon as they hit the floor, others need time.  I'd say to be direct and upfront - ""I have NOT been taught anything like this before and need assistance at least on the first time.""

The only thing I would caution you is to MAKE SURE YOU LISTEN.  I can't tell you how many times I've taught the system to someone and then a few days later I hear ""I was never taught this"".  When I hear that, I just assume they're lazy, lying, or weren't listening.  Either record on your phone the process and write it down later, or write it down right there.  Then move forward.Write individual cards maybe to the doctor and to the staff?  Like what you appreciate from each group?  And some unique treats would be neat.  Tons of store bought cookies are brought in and they're nice but when someone brings in a really tasty and interesting cookie, it goes quickly.  

I had a lady bring her cat to me because of chronic pain and I told her I could be bribed with cupcakes since she said the bill was going to be hard to take care of.  She brought the cupcakes and that was nice but she never updated me after the procedure.  I had to reach out to her and then I found out that I made a world of difference to her pet.  Honestly when I don't hear back from people, I assume 60% of the time it worked out and 40% they're totally dead.  But I am kinda negative hahaI failed it twice and still passed.  You know how many people care or ask?  0Best not to think about it.  It's done with for now.  Who knows what will happen :)First time I barely had time to study and I got right below passing.  
Second time I studied really hard and yes, got 100% on vet prep/zuku and I failed it again by even more than the first time.
Third time I was out of vet school and wayyyyy more relaxed.  The timing was my problem so I passed after I realized that.  Plus fuck the pig skin sections.Are you a veterinarian? If someone told me my salary was going to be cut, I'd leave in a heartbeat.  Veterinarians are incredibly rare right now and there are plenty of private clinics that would go nuts for you as long as you're not asking for the world.  Don't be surprised if they do let you go as the corporations are pretty short sighted and 100% focused on money.When we recieved our feedback at Purdue, even the brightest students had to get drunk before reading the reviews.  Vets are great at helping animals but they suck at teaching and providing feedback.

Just jump through their hoops and get through the program.  My friend was a brilliant surgeon and overall everyone loves her.  After school we chatted 3 years later and she basically stopped doing any and all surgery because of anxiety.  Me? I got dismal heartbreaking feedback and I do surgeries the college near me have refused because of difficulty.

Just finish up and after about 3-6 years you'll know where you stand.  It's a tough and very long road.1. Not sure what you're asking on the first question.
2. Everyone has their opinion on vet med.  It's really really hard and anyone that goes into the field thinking they're working on puppies is delusional.  Which unfortunately is the case because there are folks that get into the field and then are surprised that it's hard as hell and they can't leave because they have to pay off the loans.  Go work or volunteer at a vet clinic or two and make your own opinion.  I personally find being a veterinarian very liberating because I can move anywhere, I'm wanted, and I can do good for others.  But I also find it exhausting, mentally depressing, and you're going to need a therapist for sure.
3. You can pay them off with Income Based Repayment.  You will have to have a strategy to pay them off but think of it like getting a mortgage without a house.  
4. Depends on the school.  A lot of them teach everything because the NAVLE tests you on all the animals BUT you can select extra courses in your field of interest.Ross School of Veterinary Medicine is English based and is technically abroad.Most schools have a list of pre-requistes they require.  They like to see people are moving towards a degree but they will accept folks before they finish a bachelors if they're impressive enough.  Yes, if the trade school doesn't have the required credits, it's not helping.  Find out if the trade school has all the required courses and that they're considered acceptable by the majority of schools.","Veterinarian.

Parody101,"I'm so sorry hun. Definitely get out when you can. The job market still seems great for vets. Get out and find somewhere better for you. I was stuck in a crappy loop with my first/old clinic and leaving was the best thing I ever did. I thought I was burning out of veterinary medicine/wanting to be a vet. Turns out I was just done being there. Every clinic has challenges, no where is perfect...but still.“It’s better than nothing” in the face of the same sort of studies is definitely the same sort of thing. The irony is lost on them sadly. 

The first clinic I worked at prescribed Metro frequently so it became ingrained to me. Had an internal medicine doctor prescribe it as a component to IBD treatment for one of my patients that really seemed to help her. Nowadays I’m definitely more focused on probiotics and diet changes/fiber if the fecal float is negative, but I still do occasionally prescribe if all else fails. It is tough to overcome for sure. 

Just keep the studies in mind the best you can and focus on your own medicine, that’s all you can do.So while I would say that a work-life balance is improving for most vets, there are still many that can't achieve it currently. Unfortunately even before that, vet school itself is rigorous. Clinicals may have rotations where there is no 'balance' - and while I hope they continue to improve them - there's not going to be a promise of it.   


I think this is going to be a tough career for anyone with anxiety and depression before even entering vet school. I would take some time to shadow a few veterinary clinics if they let you to able to see what their day is like and talk to someone.Drop their contact info...I just wanna educate them.Ear mites are one of the few things that still gross me out when looking under the microscope.

The reality is that veterinary medicine is a low-paying field. You might have to leave to earn a proper salary with a decent work environment.You should try another industry before you completely commit to vet school. That way you are going in with your eyes open and you'll have no regrets. Even if it's just for one day a week at a nursery or diner.They need to lower the costs of schooling.

greyhoundknight,"Yeah, they kind of miss the whole point of spays in vet school as well as the role of spays in GPland.Start saying no. Overscheduled? Then put your foot down and say no. What is she going to do, fire you? If you are contractionally obligated to stay for two months, then start saying no. If the two months isn't in your contract then today should be your last day!Look up spay neuter techniques on the ASPCA Pro site. I've been in shelter medicine for 5 years now and having hosted vet students (and experienced vets) I am confidently say that spay surgeries are taught incorrectly.

Incision placement is super important and the ASPCA Pro site has some videos on it. Typing it out sucks but I can if you'd like. With cats, I would either break/cut the ligament to do autoligation OR I would suture ligate with the ligament intact. Another tip for for cats and dogs is to always single ligate the broad ligament unless it is super clear. They won't bleed out from those vessels but they can bleed enough to trick you into thinking something important is bleeding. Last tip is to not clamp the uterus; it's friable and weak so just reflect caudally and place your ligatures.

Edit to add: use a modified miller's/strangling ligature on the ovaries pedicles. For dogs you can tighten those suckers until it nearly breaks. All my pedicles get a single strangling. There was actually a paper a few years ago that showed strangling provided the best hemostasis in the hands of junior surgeons, but most of my vet students are still not being taught it.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

I've spoken with my boss and said I need more in person support and my mental health was going downhill, and was basically told that they don't have a magic wand and can't pluck another vet from thin air, and even though they're hiring so far none of the interviewed vet applicants have agreed to take up the job. We discussed options like having more emergency consult slots and blocking off the last consult, but I was told this can only be a temporary option. I think it's quite unlikely they'll get another vet soon which is the only way to alleviate my concerns, and I'm strongly considering leaving, but am worried if I do so now it will leave bad blood between me and the practice as it would be really difficult for them if I leave now...Thank you for your reply! My mentor is now my boss lol, so the situation has become a bit tricky. I'll definitely check the competency list, that's a great point.

DrRockstar99,"Hahhahaha new grads starting at >$200k hahhahhahahHow much do you think the average new grad produces? How much does that make them worth?How much did you produce? Enough to cover a $200k salary? My last three new grads have produced between 400-500k their first year, but with our prices skyrocketing, I bet they might be closer to between 500-600 now if we maintained a normal schedule. But, with inflation the way it is, vet visits are way way way down in our area and cliebts is doing the minimum so even I am probably barely going to hit 700k this year. Quite a change from Covid years.  YMMV.Eclinpath is free and a really good resourceToo much to respond to beyond that my vet school experience was the complete opposite. I had lovely classmates (albeit all about ten years younger than me so I wasn’t really involved in any drama), lovely professors (many of whom I’d still feel comfortable calling up to ask questions to this day), a supportive atmosphere, and because I decided I wanted to be well rounded, plenty of opportunity to take lots of large animal and production electives and rotations. As a NYC girl with my only large animal background being that I rode a little, I had zero problems tackling dystocia, colic, choke etc right out of school. 

With the exception of a couple of weeks here and there while on ECC rotations I had great work life balance with plenty of time throughout my four years for outside activities. I didn’t spend a single weekend on campus my entire four years unless I was required to be there for clinics.

Unlike everyone else’s experience, it’s been fine. I don’t we would have survived Covid as smoothly as we did. They buy me pretty much anything I ask for. Wages went up tremendously. They increased prices to clients a ton- now maybe people would argue what is bad, but I’d argue that we’ve been undercharging for our services for eternity and at some point we need to charge appropriately for our skill and services. Yeah it sucks but the cost of EVERYTHING has gone up. A CBC/Chem for the $60 our previous owner was charging wasn’t sustainable. A COHAT at $300 wasn’t going to pay our techs’ salary. I think that was the one thing- some our prices swung too far in the other direction, but they’ve been really receptive to feedback; eg if I think we should charge more for the things that take time and effort and skill and less for the shoppable things that people can get anywhere (like a vaccine or drugs) getting price adjustments has not been difficult. Nobody has EVERY harassed us about our “numbers” explicitly; at MOST it’s been like hey , if a doctor can see two more appointments in a day that would pay for us to get your a virtual scribe so you don’t have to spend as much time doing records.

pixiegurly,"LVT here. 

I think it's really common for techs to be wary, suspicious, and on guard around new grad drs. Enough come into the clinic where the techs have been established, and start with a big ego , disregard our input, and honestly, make mistakes that cause harm. It's absolutely not a reason to be disrespectful tho, but that's definitely how it manifests in some. In which case just demonstrating respect and listening and considering input and *letting us do our part of the job*. 


The other thing is, a TON of techs have a huge chip on their shoulder. Especially, IME, OJT trained ones without a license. I think it's just because of how in general our skills (as are y'all's) are so devalued by society, clients, and also Drs. Plus all the other bs that is in veterinary medicine. When I was new to ER and recently graduated, I had a very skillful experienced OJT tech tell me I wasn't a real tech and my license was just a piece of paper bc I didn't have the same experience. 🙄 And I always valued and respected those with more experience than me. When he said that, I quickly shut it down with no, I have a license I AM a tech, and if he liked he could call me a baby tech bc I'm new and fine with that term. We didn't have a problem after that. I've also seen some say an LVT wasn't an LVT bc they had been outta practice for a while and were rusty on skills. Any excuse to be 'better than.' like crabs in a bucket. It's dumb. 


If directly talking to the tech and asking them hey, what's with you refusing to call me Dr, what can I do to make you feel more comfortable working with me and respecting my title and schooling? (Bc asking like that, in the 'what can I do' way is far less likely to put someone on offense, and may even cause them to consider their role in the relationship.) if that doesn't work, talk to the manager or HR or lead tech or supervisor or lead Dr or whomever about the issue so they can handle it.","Veterinarian.

omegasavant,"Some schools, Illinois being one of them, have steep grade cutoffs for OOS applicants. 

In general, it's a bad idea to get attached to a specific school. Applying for vet school means that you'll be throwing darts at a board. Every AVMA-accredited vet school has similar standards and a similar curriculum. There are no reach schools, no safety schools, and no guarantee that *any* application will happen to get the admissions committee's interest. 

Once you have an application that you're confident in, apply as widely as you can and go to the cheapest AVMA accredited school to accept you.OOS standards are higher due to the sheer number of applications received. Most states have one vet school or none. If you're applying to 10 schools, nine of those applications are out of state. Everyone else does the same thing, and it gets worse every year.

Many schools have specific slots reserved for IS applicants. And they charge exorbitantly for OOS, since there's no state subsidization--which means you might end up paying twice or three times as much for the same education.

I recommend that you do some careful, thorough reading about how the application process works before you spend thousands applying. Some schools give in-state tuition after a year. Some schools have 3.8-4.0 cutoffs. Some are likely too expensive to be worth it even if you're in-state (looking at you, Tufts). 

Go comb through the schools' websites. Check in advance for weird pre-req requirements that might disqualify you. Similarly, make sure your pre-req GPA is high enough for those schools that use that as a metric. Seriously consider whether you need a Master's or post-bacc work to be competitive. And figure out if you're willing to take on the risk of an island school.

If you don't have good answers for those questions and don't have a concrete plan, take some time off before you apply.I was an ACO in southern Texas before getting into vet school. I would've killed to have a resource like you at our disposal. Apologies for the length of the post and don't take offense if you're already tracking on some of the issues I talk about here.

First and foremost: it is difficult to stress how little it takes to make a difference in the quality of life for some of these animals.  

They're getting fed inconsistently or living off table scraps. Is there a pet food bank where you live? What would be required to set one up?

Half the ones that *are* getting fed aren't keeping that nutrition due to worm burden. Pyrantel is cheap and safe. If I'd been in charge we would have had a bottle in the back of every truck. Instead we counseled people to go to the vet. They're never going to the vet: the exam fee alone is a day's pay, maybe two. So animals die for want of 30 cents of dewormer.

They're not vaccinated. Not for rabies, not for parvo. Literally anything helps. Immunity in adults can last for something like 7 years, per recent studies. I'm not saying you should vaccinate your dog, specifically, every 7 years, but you can make a dent in a population-level problem even if it's done inconsistently. Puppy vaccines are more complicated, but your neighbors know what parvo is, they know puppies die from it, and they will prevent it if they know how. Spend ten minutes talking about it--odds are good you're the first person to have had that conversation with them. 

I don't have a good solution for the heartworm problem. Most of these dogs will get it eventually, and even if you use proheart you need to at least see these animals once a year. If you have the budget to do HW testing and proheart, though, you can at least make a dent.

They're on a chain in the backyard. Trolley systems are 10 bucks and can give that animal the whole yard, instead of getting strangled on a post. Or dying in the summer because they got tangled up and can't reach the water bowl. Fixed tethers were actually illegal in my jurisdiction, so we spent a lot of time giving those out and getting them set up. (Though you do have to set it up--it's just difficult enough to figure out that if you don't, there'll be an unwrapped trolley on the porch whenever you're called back to that house.)

They're not *owned*. By the time I wrapped up, I came to the conclusion that there isn't a single genuine stray dog in the whole city. Shelters are full of dumped animals, and their already-thin budgets are covering pets that should be at home with their owners. How do you help with that? Microchips. Microchip puppies while they're small and cute. Give your shelter options when those animals get dumped five years later. You also do get some striking reunion stories out of this. I've reunited people with pets that had gotten out of a fence a decade earlier. 

Finally--there's a lot you can do by just casting a wide net. Ask for help and do it without an ounce of shame. My shelter had a list of rescues and nonprofits that a had a variety of resources at their disposal. Some of them specialized in injured animals, some in aggressive animals, some in specific breeds. A lot of them had nationwide coverage, generally with a headquarters somewhere up north. See if there's any names on that list who could either help with a spay/neuter effort or direct you to an organization that can. You're not the first people to want to set up a new spay/neuter clinic, and I suspect you'll be able to get good advice on the logistics from people who've done it before. Bother your city, too. Do they know that there's a bunch of vet students chomping at the bit to help with their dog problem? Remind them that they have that resource at their disposal and ask, politely but firmly, if they can help you help them.I agree with ""something not vet-related"". Get them something that's related to a hobby they cared about in the Before Times, before they got in--art supplies, a nice book, what have you. 

The best thing you can get them is a reminder that they're still human.","Other. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Other"" as it does not specifically mention medical or veterinary practice, but rather discusses various ways",Other
ohfuckmeee,"I'd say the answer to this question is completely dependent on what you would have to pay for said minority shares and the EBITA margin of the business. Think of it like any other investment

If you have to pay top dollar for the shares, or the EBITA margin of the business sucks, then you might be better off putting the money in a different investment and just working there.

If you're getting the shares at a discount rate, the EBITA margin is healthy, and you feel comfortable in the stability of the business, then probably a good idea if you don't need the money right now.

An additional factor is I'd also try to estimate how much this will obligate you to engage in managing the business and then if you're not going to get additional compensation for that, do a mental cost benefit analysis of the time you'll invest in the managing compared to the dividend revenue and expected cap gains of the equity.

Also, it’s something that no one wants to talk about in fear of being labeled a sexist is the fact that vet schools are now 80/20 (or more) female to male. Every profession that’s overwhelmingly female has shortages. Many women prioritize having and raising children (understandable) over career.

Vertigote,"How are they doing surgery without bw?!Sorry I stuck my nose where it didn’t belong. Scrolling Reddit and ended up in vet subreddit. 

Both vets I see clinic policy is bw in last 30 days and Two emergency vet clinics do it too. I’m realizing it’s probably an abundance of caution and it means they can always check the bw results if I ask about a med or there’s more pain. It’s just easier than arguing with clients about whether or not it’s necessary before hand. Or afterwards, and getting them to come back. Us clients are harder to wrangle than the patients.

I think people jump on evidence that gives them something they can do, to control or improve, to be useful. And even better if it gives them something they can do that doesn’t require change and means they’ve been doing the right thing all along.My podiatrist is aggressively insistent on brooks or hokas with super feet inserts. I’ve repeatedly broken bones in my feet, have arthritis and an inflammatory problem and bone marrow edema and my feet are just screwed. And while it’s painful still it’s now doable for me to be back to running 15 miles a week. Also compression socks. 
It’s incredibly useful for me to check in with a good physical therapist occasionally and have her check my posture, and how I walk. They can have me make seemingly insignificant changes like adjusting hip angle or engaging abdominals correctly. It took me from blindingly stabbing pain in my lower back to a full throb which is bearable. They can be magic workers.

It also helps me to freeze water bottles and roll them back and forth under my feet at the end of the day. 

And adding any fatigue mats to anywhere you stand often when you can add them. In front of washer or dryer, sinks, stove, whatever.My cat is the first pic, but with more drooling and vicious side eye. But I love my vet and vet techs and want them to have every chance at being injury free. 
She bit a few people, damaged a computer, and the emergency vet had to verify she wasn’t actually feral. she got discharged early and they’d call me every 4 to 6 hours to check on her. They got gifts of makeup, nail Polish, coffee, anything that I overheard them mentioning they liked.  The robbed the bank part is what made me think of her. But that would be constructive with a purpose. I feel like my cat would try to burn it down and walk away.I think people will continue with non compliance mostly but it’s helpful for them feeling confident about administering the med. I wasn’t sympathetic to how unfamiliar and uncomfortable people were with giving meds. Demonstrating and practicing with water helped too.

>but I don't where it goes : Containers, Image so one

Where what goes ? the Docker Node app ?First, you should use your default command line ( cmd assuming you use Windows ) to enter the docker command line while your Docker App is up and running.

This will pull the app in docker, then launch it.

**But**.

In the command line you have the parameter ""-v"" with ""myst-data:/var/lib/mysterium-node""are you aware that you should replace ""myst-data"" at the begining with the drive you want to store the data on ?*Assuming you use Windows, this could be :*

*docker pull mysteriumnetwork/myst && docker run --cap-add NET\_ADMIN -d -p 4449:4449 --name myst -v* ***C:\\myfolder:/var/lib/mysterium-node*** *--restart unless-stopped mysteriumnetwork/myst:latest service --agreed-terms-and-conditions*

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

\++ ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/y8lvjw/setup_manually_using_docker_advanced/itttlk9/  In both cases, the folder you are looking for from here is keystore.  
It should be alongside folders like logs, mainnet, nodeui etc... and files like nodeui-pass. 

This folder is your node Identity. Keystore folder contains your private key.   


As long as you have it, you can manage to set your node and recover the paid connexion to your mystnode.   
**=> you can't retrieve a node if you lost the keystore, because there is no way to recover the private key.**   


**PART 1 : Recover that keystore**

For the first case, if you used docker without setting a custom path for your data, it's not lost 100%.  
The data in this case seems to be stored with the container's volume. So it's still here as long as you don't remove it.   
To access it, if my memory is correct, you first launch the docker services, wich i assume will start WSL.   
Then, you can go to the network volume : \\\\wsl$ in your file explorer ( or click the Linux icon on the left pane if you see it ) .  
Then, you should have folders named like :   
**docker-desktop-data\\version-pack-data\\community\\docker\\volumes**

Then you should have a name corresponding the one of your volume ( check the volume in use when you start the myst container ). 

Now, you are looking for a folder containing the keystore. 

**If you can manage to find it, backup it**

&#x200B;

For the second case, I don't really know the difference between Native and Docker.  
But !   
If you paid a node in Native mode, then you can find the **keystore** in your home folder, under the **.myst** folder. 

**Once again, backup the whole .myst folder if you find it.** 

  
For the Docker mode, i'm really not sure where to find the keystore.. sry ! 

**PART 2 : set a new node**

If you manage to backup a folder with your node identity, if you put it on a disk named Z under the name MYST,you could set a new Docker container with the command :   


*docker pull mysteriumnetwork/myst && docker run --cap-add NET\_ADMIN -d -p 4449:4449 --name myst -v* ***Z:\\MYST****:/var/lib/mysterium-node --restart unless-stopped mysteriumnetwork/myst:latest service --agreed-terms-and-conditions*  
And recover your paid node on myst Node.

xdg07,">Are we expected to see a traffic increase for non-whitelisted nodes in the near future?

Yes, definitely. Both dVPN and B2B product usage is growing. Our network traffic almost doubled during this year while dVPN app user base grew 5x. Also, we're improving B2B client infrastructure, so their traffic is more equally distributed between more providers. In order to get more earnings it's recommended to have your node up 24/7, use residential IP and of course check which countries are the most demanded (like UK, US, CA, AU, NZ, FR, IT, DE, IN, SG, HK, CH, MY and so on).>Why should I invest in MYST now? What are your plans to drive value to the token?

MYST token is used directly in the network which means that the bigger network the bigger demand for MYST tokens. In other words, all Mysterium network consumers (both dVPN app users or B2B clients) need MYST token to pay for Network services, so with growing network there will be constant demand for MYST token. As mentioned above, both our dVPN consumer and B2B client base is growing, meaning that network traffic is increasing as well.  
Additionally, you can stake your MYST token into Delegation pool https://app.iq.space/ (powered by our partners IQ protocol) and earn rewards.>Is there a specific reason that Mysterium VPN is not listed on the Apple store?

Yes, the main issue was technical iOS requirements for the runtime.

So it's safe to say that 99% of nodes are run by community.  >Are we expected to see a traffic increase for non-whitelisted nodes in the near future?

Yes, definitely. Both dVPN and B2B product usage is growing. Our network traffic almost doubled during this year while dVPN app user base grew 5x. Also, we're improving B2B client infrastructure, so their traffic is more equally distributed between more providers. In order to get more earnings it's recommended to have your node up 24/7, use residential IP and of course check which countries are the most demanded (like UK, US, CA, AU, NZ, FR, IT, DE, IN, SG, HK, CH, MY and so on). ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vyu85k/ama_hi_reddit_donatas_and_savannah_here_from/ig4fxhy/  >Why should I invest in MYST now? What are your plans to drive value to the token?

MYST token is used directly in the network which means that the bigger network the bigger demand for MYST tokens. In other words, all Mysterium network consumers (both dVPN app users or B2B clients) need MYST token to pay for Network services, so with growing network there will be constant demand for MYST token. As mentioned above, both our dVPN consumer and B2B client base is growing, meaning that network traffic is increasing as well.  
Additionally, you can stake your MYST token into Delegation pool https://app.iq.space/ (powered by our partners IQ protocol) and earn rewards. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/vyu85k/ama_hi_reddit_donatas_and_savannah_here_from/ig4hndw/  >Is there a specific reason that Mysterium VPN is not listed on the Apple store?

Yes, the main issue was technical iOS requirements for the runtime.

This image shows that NetSys also uses the ""Thanks for the love"" copy paste response on many reviews other than ""Thanks"" ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z5za2w/lets_talk_about_how_90_of_the_android_app_google/iyam6vw/  My question for you is: how would Mysterium be benefitted from some 5-star review bots if they don't often get bad ratings and don't do anything fishy? Why would they do it if there aren't any benefits? Most people likely won't care if an app rating is a bit less than 5. Not like Mysterium gets money from reviews (unless something on google play does that?), and the chances of someone seeing the reviews and seeing all of ""Thanks"" and deciding to get the app and buy stuff is rare. They would likely see the bots and decide to leave, which brings me to my next point. If another company rating botted Mysterium with five stars, it could seem untrustworthy to people (such as yourself), and then people would not use the application and try spreading that it's deceitful. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z5za2w/lets_talk_about_how_90_of_the_android_app_google/iyakv1m/  Also, if Mysterium's app rating inflated by a worker, Mysterium could get more sales, get more profit, and in turn salary's may be increased. With it being 0.01c per review, spending a few bucks might be good for extra work money. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z5za2w/lets_talk_about_how_90_of_the_android_app_google/iyamfhp/  It is a possibility, though unlikely. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z5za2w/lets_talk_about_how_90_of_the_android_app_google/iyamayw/  I'm not professional, and you should not base the entirety of Mysterium off of me. It appears you also only responded to a singular part of my comment.

Higher ratings would inflate the presence when searching ""VPN"", but ordinary people would check the reviews. If you look at reviews on play store, the trending reviews are currently 1 star and 5 star, which could intrigue people to look further. Seeing all the spam reviews would definitely make people suspicious, which is why Mysterium wouldn't do this, unless they are absolutely stupid. Looking through the ""see all reviews"" though, I scrolled a bit and didn't see a single ""Thank"" review. If you read the rest of my comment, it would also show similar to this, so I am hoping you actually read this comment this time. If Mysterium wanted review bots, I think they would be smart enough to not spam just ""Thank"", but rather random sets, which would be very suspicious still, but still show intelligence. Unless Mysterium is using reverse psychology here, they likely aren't trying to buy reviews. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/z5za2w/lets_talk_about_how_90_of_the_android_app_google/iyflai5/  i was using the myst app, not hosting a node (if you're saying that)

I immediately told my practice and they adjusted my contract so I was a “VGAL” or veterinary graduate awaiting licensure. I had the same contract modified to reduce my pay with wording to restore my initial negotiated salary once I passed the NAVLE and obtained my license.

I worked in the hospital under the medical director’s supervision (she had to sign everything as I was under her license) until I passed the NAVLE that December. 

That being said, you can just let prospective practices know that you’re taking the NAVLE in April and negotiate your expected salary as a licensed veterinarian, with no further explanation needed at this time. Your scenario is really no different than fourth year students who accept positions in November, prior to graduation and taking the NAVLE for the first time. 

If you do not pass in April, that is when you should inquire about the VGAL process. I did not negotiate my VGAL salary (was 65% of my current salary) as I felt it was more than fair.Same here!

Honestly, my age never bothered me.

People go through school at different rates. Also, I feel like my age has actually been an advantage to figuring out goals. Because while I wanted to go to vet school from high school and undergrad, I have a very different outlook on it at 25 than I did at 18.

FTM_2022,"Nearly everyone in our class started in their mid-20s.

Thats because most students in NA complete a 4 year bachelor degree then go to vet school. Many also take a year or two to work, complete a masters, or need multiple application cycles to get in. I think the majority of us were 22-26 in our class. I was 25. Youngest was 20, oldest was 32. 

You would be exactly average, lol.That's literally all that our intake interview was about: difficult ethical choices. Sometimes, there is no good choice. I highly recommend you read up on ethics in veterinary medicine before pursuing a career in it.Well, as they say, you can lead a horse to water...Lots of great responses here.

I'll add my story. The day I decided to become a vet was after dinner at my parents. I was 25, nearing the end of my masters and the next step would have been a PhD but I didn't want that. As I was leaving, a thought struck me:

I'm going to apply to vet med. 

And that's what I did. It wasn't some life long desire. It was a whim. A passing thought. That took root and grew like a weed. I liked medicine. That's what I wanted to do. So I did it and it worked out.

It doesn't have to be a big dream! It can be exactly what you want right now. For the record I very much disliked vet school and live clinical practice.Absolutely! I love it. ❤️ 

Wouldn't change to any other profession!Speaking to knowing less - it's ok! I wasn't the top of my class. I'm not some superstar up and coming vet. I'm not a specialist. I'm what I am! One of thousands. I know what I know and I learn new things everyday. It's good to acknowledge where you are at and to know your limitations.If I might add start with areas that will serve you best. You have so much information to learn it's ok to prioritize!

I was never going to be a horse vet. I learned what I needed to know for tests and the NAVLE and nothing more. 

I devoted my precious extra time to brushing up on stuff I'll actually use once in practice.For me, like many others, it's not actually the euthanasias that are the hardest. This is because we are doing them a kindness and relieving suffering. While I do cry during euths it's sympathy tears, I don't carry those with me through the day. Euthanasia is an essential service and probably most important aspect of my job. I actually like that we can relieve suffering this way in animal medicine. One of my many reasons for being a vet is to help suffering animal. Death is a part if life. If I can ease their passage I have done good. For this reason Euthanasias have never been hard on me. I never carry it as a burden. It's not meant to be seen as such IMO.

The hard part is when an animal is sick and owners don't want to do anything about it and let the suffering continue.I'm 5 years out and still ask tons of questions! I learn so much everyday. I also make mistakes too. We're human. You just gotta keep learning and growing. 

Best thing is to learn how to close the book on work and not take it home with you. It can take practice but it's a skill worth learning. Work at work. Everything else is downtime.I think I did like 3. 

I Havnt done any since. #ERIf it was so far along that it succumbed to the GDV in the time that OP described I don't think emergency interventions or surgery would have made a big difference. The prognosis was grave regardless what OP (or their team) did or didn't do.Sedate me please!34F here. Grad 2019. Had baby in 2022 at 32y. Canadian so I took my full 18mo leave, now back 3/4 time:

Have your baby.

Take ALL the time off you want. 

Come back part time if you want.

Ease back into it.

Vet med will always be there. Spending time with baby and being there for her is my priority now. Work is second. I love being a vet but it has changed my outlook. Life is so much more now. As the kids say ""it's totally extra"". I'm living my best life for me and my kid. She and family are priority and I love this mental shift. Before I was burnt out, so tired of work. I'm refreshed and have put way less pressure on myself. I'm having fun again, working less, and spending more time with her.

I don't know what you mean by ""advancing"" in your career. Unless you are wanting or planning on specialty taking a year (or more) off at this point isn't going to hurt you. You've got the skills, you've got the experience, you've got the credentials.

sconniefatcat2,"Thank you I appreciate that! Believe it our not many of us don’t hear that very often. Most of the people in this profession really do it for the love of animals because the pay is terrible (especially for the techs and their job is so physically and emotionally demanding) and the downsides are many.Doctors love to blow off health concerns as mental problems so don’t be afraid to advocate for your health by asking your GP for bloodwork, maybe a thyroid panel to rule out medical reasons for exhaustion. Because at 27 if you are already exhausted in this field get ready for a really long career of being tired. It’s not much better after internship/residency.Maybe you’ll adjust with time. And sometimes it’s the specific job that makes you exhausted. I’ve been a vet for 23 years and I’ve gone through periods of hating what I do but feeling trapped in the profession, periods of feeling taken advantage of by employers, feelings of dreading going to work which invaded and ruined my time off. But the last 4 years I’ve been at a job I love, finally treated like a valued employee, finally paid well, and I only work 10 days a month so plenty of down time. I look forward to going to work. It’s made all the difference.If you like surgery consider sticking with ER. I also thought I wanted to be a surgeon, did a rotating internship and surgical internship but didn’t match to a residency. I kind of fell into ER, and now I love it, I get to do all kinds of fun surgery, and the best part is no orthopedics (unless you want to, one of my ER colleagues does some fracture repairs and TPLOs) . If I had to cut knees all day long like most private practice surgeons I’d be bored out of my mind.You get to be wrong all the time with no consequences and make tons of money doing it. Great work if you can get it.Have you ever actually worked in the veterinary field? If not I recommend that you do so before making your decision. The reality of being a vet is often not what people think. It’s 10% dealing with the animal and 90% dealing with people.","Veterinarian.

shittyequinox,"Not a tech, but worked in ER/Specialty for a number of years (IM specifically). We had this same issue with techs who had been there for years when we got new residents. 

I will say, we did have constant issues with having to stay 1-2+ hours late consistently due to the residents moving slower. I think our tech’s behavior was just from being worn down from the industry and not having the patience to deal with baby vets on the daily. 

TBF, our schedule was always packed and we were chronically over-worked. We also had many residents who refused to listen to experienced techs/assistants in the field, which would just cause more problems. 

But that tech being directly disrespectful is a problem. You are a DVM, if you want to me called Dr., that is absolutely fine and that tech should respect that.","Veterinarian.

I give them all the respect they deserve. Will new DVMs rely heavily upon experienced technicians, sure. It’s the same as new technicians relying on an experienced DVM sometimes. It goes both ways. Pettiness is just so common in this profession. I started tech school when I was older so I don’t have that many working years to go. I don’t think I could have done this my whole life. I feel for some of the younger people. There are just a lot of not nice people working in veterinary medicine. I could of used harsher words for them but you get my point. It’s not an anomaly, you shouldn’t have to jump around to 10 different hospitals until you find the right one.Sure you can retire from doing this. You just need a spouse with a good pension. You can make decent money being a tech in some places but you’ll never be able to put enough away for any kind of retirement. It will all go to living expenses because of the areas that pay those high amounts. You’ll have a sad little nest egg. It will be better if you have a spouse who is a high earner with benefits.

Gravelroadmom2,"The next sentence expanded on the subject.A young vet I know is active on Instagram and daily she post photos of clients pets in various stages of anesthesia recovery from a procedure, often shows the stitches. None of these photos are on the clinic’s social media sites. She’s going to be in a world of hurt if a sensitive client ever sees Bootsie’s photos used without permission.At clinics where I worked we happily gave out spay/neuter/castration estimates over the phone with the caveat that if they find something on the pre surgical exam the fee could up- a need for a radiograph, lab, etc. 

I wouldn’t use a practice that required an exam to get the fee quote.The difference in fees is wild. My solo practice vet charged a low exam fee because she didn’t want an exam fee to be a barrier to clients pets who needed to be seen. All meds, labs were 100+ mark up, radiographs were $90 a view. 

She moved away and my new solo practice vet charges a an exam fee $20 more than previous vet but meds are sold at about $5 more than ordering from a well known public vendor. 

The new vet ends up costing less because the meds aren’t marked up so high. 

One practice in the high money area requires full blood panel and chest X-rays for all spay/neuters, regardless of the pets age. That’s a $250 fee before the pet is sedated for spay/neuter. I’ve scrubbed in for so many cat neuters and it’s astonishing that some is going to spend $350 for a cat neuter.That is 100% correct. The odds of a young animal, healthy on physical exam, being one of those that dies is slim. 

And yes, non profits perform a valuable, affordable service in reducing reproduction in pets. So do GP clinics that don’t require those test.It’s an observation from working in a clinic that did not require them and taking phone calls at the clinic from people who were quoted $300 to neuter a 6 month old kitten.Your vet will do a thorough palpitation of your pet feeling for abnormalities. Examine the eyes, ears. Listen to the heart/lungs and have you tell them what preventative products you use- heartworm, flea/tick- and what if any other meds the pet is on. Your pet will have been weighed and if it’s fat or trending towards fat then the pets diet & exercise will be discussed.In human medicine patients now have 24/7 access to labs, summary of visit, etc done by their doctor. I’m not sure why a veterinarian would charge to reissue vax certificate. At best make a clear policy that the first one is included with the visit, additional copies cost X amount.It may be your location- 45 minutes outside a major metro area can turn into a very rural area where youngish vets may not be interested in living.Texas is a wonderful state and each region has its own identity: East verses west Texas, the Hill Country, Panhandle. A daughter lives in San Antonio and it’s wonderful for such a large city with plenty of things to do or just chill out by a pool. Austin & Dallas/Fort Worth traffic can be a hassle to navigate. Houston is a refinery city. 

I think if you lived 45 minutes outside any of those metro areas you would be pleased- big city offerings just a short drive away but day to day life in a smaller city.As a woman just out of reproductive age, I hope Texas corrects the current flaw with the law. No one should experience what Kate Cox went through.

Bennyandpenny,"I’m not sure what the culture of your clinic is, but expecting colleagues to refer to you as doctor outside of client-facing interactions is strange and is likely exacerbating any issues you have. 

When you treat technicians as colleagues instead of inferiors, and approach situations with humility, people are more likely to give you the respect you think you are entitled to. 

I am a specialist veterinarian, and I interact with referring vets, techs, vet students, etc and I treat every single person the same. No one calls me doctor, except to or in front of clients. I have never once had an issue with disrespect from colleagues. 

If you reflect on this, and you truly believe that you are truly being treated with disrespect despite a good attitude, then perhaps it should be addressed with management. I find that demanding that people behave a certain way rarely works the way you will hope, though.Yikes. Bad advice. OP is in no position to “put them in their place”. They are colleagues, and OP is not their boss.I agree- the title is hard-earned and should be used as OP wishes. The fact that a person is refusing to use the title out of spite is ridiculous. I’m not trying to invalidate OPs concerns, because the culture can definitely vary depend on where you work. Where I work, the title isn’t used between colleagues but we are very casual. Some places are less casual, and that’s fine too. 

What I’m trying to point out, and probably not articulating very well, is that if this is the hill to die on you will probably not do much to improve the tension by insisting upon using the title. When you lay that very clear hierarchy, it will just reinforce bitchy attitudes. Building trust and taking a step back to reflect on how you interact with staff will likely do a lot more to repair collegiality than giving someone a talking to.I’m a vet and it’s not about telling people what to do, it’s about expecting support staff to kow-tow because you went to school longer. 

Treat people how you would like to be treated.DACVP in a diagnostic lab- 35 hours a week, on call (during the day) one weekend out of 6. I have a great work-life balance.I loved vet school, I loved my residency and now I love my job. We existI think it’s not a lack of trust, it’s clique-y bullshit and toxic behaviour from the staff.I’m Canadian, so our tuition is more reasonable than the US. I think my level of debt was manageable. I do not think I’d be able to manage tuition from an out of province or international schoolIf the pathology residents at your institution aren’t awesome, find a new institution to do your own path residency. I fell in love with path as the second year PM student, and all of the residents were so cool and welcoming. I immediately went into a residency at my DVM institution and my resident-mates were all awesome. 

Don’t let some shit advisor talk you out of the dvm program. You deserve your spot just as much as the “normal vet” people.I did a three year residency and dropped out of the concurrent graduate program once I passed boards. I work in diagnostics, so DACVP was the goal- not academia. At the end of the day, a DVM degree will open a lot of doors, but some paths will have more hoops to jump through. I don’t think the extra time weighed me down in any way- I know residents with young families, etc.

Overall, it just boils down to how much you want to do it. It’s harder to get back into doing something than it is to just keep plowing throughDiagnostic pathologist, early career, hovering around 150k here. There’s a lot more money at the CROs.I went to OVC and I loved itI was matched to a small animal rotating internship at my dvm institution and quit before I started when I got a really good look at what intern life was like. I ended up doing a pathology residency- it wasn’t easy, but my institution treated us well. 

I wouldn’t wish a small animal clinical residency on my worst enemy.I agree - I loved vet school. I feel like you get out of vet school what you put into itI don’t know if I agree entirely with this narrative. While I’m sure that it is absolutely the case for some people who struggle with didactic teaching, tests etc. there are still mediocre students who become mediocre doctors. There seems to be this mentality that the top of the class gets out and can’t hack it, and the poor academic performers swoop in from obscurity to become James Herriot. 

I’m a specialist and I see a lot of cases come in from classmates and students that I have previously taught- I will say overall, that the students who perform poorly in vet school don’t always have the most comprehensive understanding of their cases when referring.Depends on what kind of residency you want. Most clinical residencies will want a rotating internship, and many competitive residencies will want a specialty internship as well. Other fields, like pathology and lab animal, don’t require an internship. I’ve heard derm doesn’t need one either.

I will say I was uncomfortable with how limited the degree is because the other jobs ie pharmaceutical, teaching etc aren't readily available or as easy to transition to when you practice.

Murphalurf,"A thing to keep in mind with the hands off corporations: they're hands off because they don't know and refuse to manage individual practices.  This applies especially to some of these newer groups that started with venture capitalists, most have no experience in vet med.  The corp that I worked for was so hands off that their regional manager wasn't allowed to visit more than once a quarter unless it was a crisis.  What this does is create unfamiliarity to each clinic and wasted time describing needs and wants over and over again.  What they do know is how to buy a clinic, not improve or maintain it beyond basic management or lobby face lifts.

Another thing to keep in mind is a lot of these hands off corporations don't change previous clinic benefits, so the benefits could vary from clinic to clinic.  This is great during the beginning buyout because nothing really changes, but it also eludes any infrastructure to create a plan to improve benefits.  Wild situations of staff getting a 5k a year bonus vs a larger clinic handing out $100, differences in how staff discounts are applied, etc.  

They keep clinics where they were when they bought them out.  Getting improvements in benefits outside of what the Corp allows all clinics is impossible, even when other clinics could have better benefits than the others.  

To be clear, you don't want red tape and micro management in your practice, but at the end of the day the corps will demand the price increases and dictate raise allowances with practices they have no idea who they are.  Clinics that need a lot of help don't get the support they need and you tend to compete for staff with sister clinics in the area.

I've never worked with a bigger Corp like VCA or Banfield, so this could be the same across the board, but keep in mind hands off doesn't mean better in all circumstances.Olympia veterinarian here, you'll make more than 100k a year no problem.  Keep in mind that the majority of the clinics here are owned by VetCor, which is a harder employer to negotiate anything.  They still practice negative accrual when you work prosal so keep that in mind.   When externing feel free to ask what the pay is like.  That is a realistic and important question.","Veterinarian.

I’ve had a classmate been told he’s ‘too happy and could not be taken seriously’ on evaluations😐. I also remember in my final year I was so exhausted and burnt out from studying on my rotations as finals was in the next month or so and I admit my reflexs were a bit delayed during preparation and check listing of instruments and in the middle of the hospital I was shouted at and told “I can go home if I’m not up for it” by the vet infront of all the other staff, nurses and techs. It was definitely one of the worst experiences of my life and after that I just did what I needed to do and got the hell out of that school because I vowed even if I didn’t pass that rotation I would rather drop out than redo the year there. Nevertheless, I’m done and since then the clinics I’ve been at so far have been some of the best experiences I’ve had as I’ve gotten along with the staff and vets so much so that one of them have even offered me a job. I know it’s not the same for everyone but sometimes it does get better just study hard, ace your exams and get out of there asap.Okay thank you so much! I appreciate it.","Veterinarian.

The average base salary of my graduating class was $110k.Depending on your learning style you don’t need an internship to be successful at ER. I am 8mo as a new grad into my ER career. With good mentorship, I’m thriving and feel as valuable to our team as many of the more experienced doctors. Look for a hospital that has a good training program, and won’t leave you on shift by yourself. I have had maybe 8 hours alone in the hospital since I finished my 3 month training period. 

There are some good options out there for training programs. Depending on your city, VEG’s NERD program can be decent, along with Blue Pearl emerge. Ethos has also developed a 2-3 month “internship style” training with a whole year structured mentorship program as well.

Odd_Plate4920,"I think it was a valid offer. I've declawed JUST the offending digits in a similar case before. Polydactyl cat with MANY extra toes and some so deformed they angled inward and were unable to retract and caused the cat discomfort even when kept trimmed regularly. Also, polydactyls that have the syndactyl nails where it grows super thick and are difficult to trim. These aren't weight bearing toes, and the nail won't shed like normal with using scratching posts, etc. But I agree with another poster; I tell clients we are performing a toe amputation in these cases. I think declawing has a negative association with it, and some people hear it and just shut down.Almost 7 years out, and I enjoy my job most days. My recommendations are: 1) Go to your in state school and work your hardest to take out the least amount of loans possible. Loans and loan interest add up quickly, and even having a great starting salary can make paying them off difficult. If you end up with loans well over 150,000, the monthly payment can be higher than a mortgage payment. It can be hard to fathom what that looks like until you have to pay them back. 2) Work at or extern at clinics you're interested in working in if able. There was a clinic I shadowed at once that offered me a job, so I spent 2 weeks as an extern my clincial year... discovered a toxic culture and what would have been a very unsupportive mentor. 3) Get varied experiences...shelter vs GP vs. ER, etc. Can help you appreciate the differences between each and identify what you might be interested in. 4) Work-life balance! Don't be afraid to ask for it and take your vacation days. Working every weekend and overtime is the quickest road to burnout. 5) Practice good mental and physical health now, so you have a good system in place to deal with stress and compassion fatigue.","Veterinarian.

Nocranberry,"Setting boundaries. We talk about work-life balance all the time, but it really can be make or break in health industries. It's really important to be able to leave work at work. So turning off work chats, avoiding animal related social media, and knowing when to say, ""hey that non-urgent consult needs to be moved because I'm still dealing with cases x, y and z"". Bonus points if you can afford to live on a 4 day work week. That way, you're more okay to deal with long shifts as you've got that extra day to catch up on rest and to do nothing.

Use your leave. You don't have to go anywhere or do anything with it, but use it. I personally use mine to make sure I have the day off for friends and families birthdays as that's what's important to me, and there's been too many times when I've had to miss something because we've had an emergency come in 5 minutes to close. I enjoy my work, but the people in my home life still come first. Sometimes, I take a few days off just to spend time at home with my own animals as a mental refresher.

Counselling: even if you're feeling mentally okay. Sometimes you're going to get something wrong, or something might die and you'll question everything you did and it's important to be able to frame your thinking in a way that's helpful to move forward rather than detrimental.

The most important thing to keep in mind is that you're just one person and you can't look after your patients if you don't look after yourself first.The main thing is; if you're not sure about anything, just ask questions.

Depends on if you're out front or out back at the moment, but familiarise yourself with the flea and worm treatments the clinic sells, and find out the clinic protocol on desexing (what age / weight they need to be, how long after heat / labour before they can be booked in) and that will help you cover about 50% of the client facing things","Veterinarian.

forreststumps,"Aww that’s so sad OP. I’ve been a tech for many years and I love baby vets. They’re slower, but I think they always bring new medicine into a practice and can help elevate standards of care if you let them. I think a lot of techs have the attitude of “I know better than doctors” and like to try and push their experiences on new grads if you let them. I think it’s fair to ask for a meeting and state what your boundaries are, like if you want them to hold off on all comments entirely, if you only want help if you’re stuck, if you only want help if you’re missing something. Also lay down that they should never be correcting you I front of clients, if they have something to say/ask, wait until you’re both out of the room. Bottom line is they should be trying to support you, and everyone in the clinic needs to be patient while you learn.I had a human doctor take out sutures on her dog after a large lumpectomy after 3 days because she thought it looked fine. Obviously everything dehisced and she tried to get us to cover it cause it must have been something we did wrong. Not that she admitted to taking out the sutures 11 days earlyI left GP after almost 10 years in the industry (6 as a Registered Vet Tech) to work at my local city shelter (BC Canada) I make over $30 an hour now. Im unionized, I have so much vacation I hardly know what to do with it. I’m in charge of the shelter medical decisions, and I have basically no budget (within reason). Lots of my friends left the regular GP emerg life to go be reps with veterinary companies (food, cremation, and drugs). I think unless you get very lucky you can’t necessarily make a real career and retire as a GP or even emerg technician. I think that if you’re passionate you do it for as long as you can, and then switch your area of work before you get burnt out. I couldn’t be happier in my shelter job, but who knows how long I will feel fulfilled here. Regardless there are lots of opportunities to make real living wages as a tech, I just found that hardly exists in practices, at least not without some other trade off like terrible hours or other crap.","Veterinarian.

If you fear your mental health deteriorating due to full time work as a vet, prioritize setting boundaries early. Like in the interview process.  make sure you are setting yourself up for success in all the ways you need. You are the one providing the healthcare and should in turn make an effort to keep yourself healthy. Don’t be afraid to say no to someone or something if it will truly affect your mental health.

Naiylah,"I agree and disagree. 

While my internship was exhausting and underpaid, the mentorship and experience I obtained has been critical to my success. Some of the Dvms were “bad eggs” but not most. I did a private practice internship.

My residency (in academia) was a supportive and nurturing environment with amazing mentorship. Very underpaid. 

But I do agree- the lack of oversight has lead to many abusive programs.

I also have concerns about the numbers of residency programs (in both academia and private practice ) that require extensive non competes or agreements to work for the group for xxxyears. This seems predatory.

I do find fewer and fewer vet students come thru with plans for internships nowadays, and find many 4th year students to be woefully unprepared for clinical practice.","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it mentions ""Dvms"" (Doctors of",Veterinarian

I did everything to get here and once I did, I quickly realized it’s not all it’s cracked up to be. Out of close vet friends only about 30% love the job. I don’t hate being a vet but I imagined something more exciting or rewarding. Most of my day is recommending things to people who don’t want to listen, making estimates/treatment plans and then having people tell me they can’t afford any of it (and then saying we’re in it for the money- btw the money is not great lol) and avoiding getting bit by aggressive Covid dogs with owners who say “oh he’s just warning you!!!” when they’re growling.

Express_Technology37,"I've been worrying about the same exact thing especially with the new schools slated to open or schools announcing their intent. It's one of the things that is strongly convincing me of specializing if I do well enough in vet school since at least the number of residency spots isn't rapidly expanding.

I worry that this field will turn into what pharmacy looks like in the present day.scrub allowance

gym membership

extra PTO

pension

but honestly making sure the health insurance is good. I am stuck at VEG for now but its not in my long term plan as long as they have shitty health coverage (covers only 80%) *I tell you what, my love*, you have literally no fucking idea what you're talking about. You are not in any position to provide advice to someone when you haven't even stepped into this field yet.I’m not saying you didn’t suggest it. In your case it was better to say nothing regardless. I use Vetspire and it was definitely a UX upgrade compare to Cornerstone. Good software exists its just $$ that practices aren't willing to spend.

Switching software is a whole headache. not to mention you'll need to migrate records or support both softwares for several years.Eh. Not necessarily especially with the advent of the M1 chip and above. The way they are able to integrate their hardware and software isn’t really possible for PCs. 

They hold their value much longer than PCs for a reason. My ten year old laptop is still fast enough to be my primary computer.Idk. The comparable PC machines are at the same price point as mac or more expensive. I used to work in my college’s technology inventory and the only pro the Dell business grade laptops had was the repairability in-houseeven without license protection - starting off as a tech is irresponsible. thats how we get posts like this: [https://www.reddit.com/r/VetTech/comments/17vene0/what\_are\_these\_and\_how\_often\_should\_they\_be/](https://www.reddit.com/r/VetTech/comments/17vene0/what_are_these_and_how_often_should_they_be/)

if you're new to the industry and they're actually making you do tech things (and not just a tech in name)-- thats a breeding group for malpractice.with license protection thats not really a thing anymore. its irresponsible to recommend that someone without prior experience or schooling go straight into a technician role where they are expected to calculate drug dosage, monitor sedation, place ivc, monitor patients, etcthat sounds like a good plan. I also had a more skilled job (financial technology) and I was bored as hell and depressed. even if it doesn't require a lot of brain power to restrain an animal and clean--- there is a lot to learn and I found the process really enjoyable. I went the vet school route but imo nursing tasks are more ""fun"" its just that the pay isn't great.iirc its self-reportingThere’s no point in working towards a specific career right now.

spaghetti000s,"Steps to becoming a Radiologist:

Vet school:
x. Be within the top 1/3 of your class in Vet school (4 years)
x. Try and get published while in vet school (even just a case report is incredibly helpful)
x. Get to know your radiology department in vet school; if at all possible try to get a student worker position in the department. Ask questions, don't be annoying, read Thrall textbook as often as you can

Post Vet School:
x. Rotating internship first, choose one that has at least 2 board certified radiologists (need at least two letters of rec from them)
x. if you didn't get published in vet school, you need to do it during the rotating internship
x. Read Thrall on your downtime

Post Rotating Internship:
x. Apply for both specialty radiology imaging internships (1yr) and residencies (3-4yrs) in the same Match cycle; if you don't match to a residency first try (quite rare), hopefully you'll match to an imaging internship. Get published during this internship if you did not in the previous two steps. Read the entirety of Thrall during this internship.

x. Many many people get stuck after rotating and are unable to secure a residency position; its very competitive. It's a mix of good preparation (high GPA, good letters of rec, publications), personality (gotta get along with people for three years in residency so they won't choose an asshole no matter how brilliant you are), and connections (see step 1, getting to know the radiology department at your vet school). Above all, a healthy does of luck.


Why do all of this? Radiology is AWESOME. Most interesting specialty by far, radiologists are the hub of the hospital and get to discuss every interesting case with the top specialists in the hospital. NO owner communication - never get yelled at or make another estimate ever again. Work life balance - arguably the best you'll ever have in this field, you can work from home 100% of the time if you want to, but also amazing flexibility (can work part time from home, part in specialty hospital for example, or go do ultrasounds in local clinics one day a week). Money - you'll be nice and comfy. 

If you have the financial means and the time to put your head down and grind through the internships to get a residency... I say give it a shot. Hit me up with questions if you have them!Most of the doctors working at vet schools have to also be doing research in addition to their clinical and teaching duties. A lot of them will be willing to let students work in their lab and help with their current projects so that’s a way to get your name on something. Also going to the specialty you’re interested in (radiology in my case) and asking if any of them would be interested in mentoring you and helping you write a case report (way shorter and easier to do than a full research study). Essentially you have to find a “grown up” lol to help you get started.

Edit to add - you should’ve been assigned an advisor when you started vet school. They can probably help you find a project to jump onHonestly as someone who feels like they really fucked up their internship and did not grow or thrive like they wanted to, this reply almost made me cry. Take this response to heart OP, it’s a good one. 

I kept my head down and made it through my internship and it sucked and I felt almost worse for having done it… but I’m in my residency now in the specialty I love and I’m having a great time. Internship in some cases can just be a hoop to jump through or means to an end. No matter what you choose you aren’t wrong OP.

thornbeary,"I have similar worries about graduating. When I was a tech, we had a couple new grads, and we tended to trust them and only intervene if there was an obvious medical error in the works.

I want to be friendly with my colleagues and to be able to make mistakes without worrying about them writing me off as a clueless new grad, especially if that’s going to become more of a stereotype. 

And since people are getting hung up on the title part, it’s definitely cultural. I work in our teaching hospital, all of the doctors are “Dr. Lastname” or just “Lastname,” unless they explicitly ask to be called by their first name (usually interns and residents). Before school, I was a tech at an ER where we called all of the drs Doctor, even if it was just “Dr. B” or “Dr. Emily” instead of a full formal last name.

dvmdude,"I don't think it will hurt your odds of landing a job in clinical practice, but it may make the transition back to the clinical side more difficult if you don't practice at all in the meantime.If you can fog a window you can get a job as a veterinarian right now.It's one thing for them not to trust you as you get your feet underneath you, but it's entirely another to put you down while you're trying. Honestly, it's such an associate's market right now, I would put my foot down hard and if the behaviour doesn't improve, go elsewhere. Yeah, you might be able to work at it with time etc. but why bother? You have enough on your plate and don't need to be feeling like this because of your coworkers.Scribenote user here. It’s a game changer. Interesting. On one hand, if you take this on and don't enjoy ownership, you have the benefit of being able to sell your shares and move on to something else without the whole place going down. If you start your own practice, that becomes much more challenging.  


I think a lot depends on your personality and how much control you need to have. There is a big difference between a minority shareholder and a sole owner - good and bad. I would be tempted to take this deal, as long as you get excellent legal advice and are comfortable with the terms of your contracts, particularly when it comes to getting out. Partnerships are a bit like marriage and a bad partner can sour the whole thing, so please make sure you have safeguards in place for the worst case scenario.  


Very few entrepreneurs feel absolute surety when it comes to owning a business. Feeling underprepared is a normal part of growth. Your drive to learn and improve is what gets you through it.It's highly individual. What do YOU need in a mentor? Case rounds? Daily or weekly? How many spays do you want your mentor to scrub into? Are you an independent learner or would you like a lot of support?

It is extremely important that you put this on paper ahead of time. They are under no real obligation to mentor you otherwise, and your mentor will have likely had a very different experience when they graduated than you will. ""See one, do one, teach one"" was common, and isn't sufficient for many new grads these days.  


I would also go in and look at the Dr's schedules, is there time for notes? Are they slamming appointments q20mins back to back all day? Right now it is an associate's market, make sure you get what you want, and realize that the more salary you take, the more you are expected to produce. If you think you'd benefit from a very involved mentor, be willing to settle for a little less compensation.It happens to everyone. One thing I did early on was tie my knots too close to the clamp. Clamps can spread the pedicle quite wide, so if you tie too close to it the ligature might initially be tight but the pedicle shrinks once you remove the clamp and the ligature slips. Try shimmying the knot down a little bit or making sure you have a good crush to tie.

I am a double-ligater too, and I tend to do my first knot further down the pedicle (sometimes without clamping depending on fat) and tighten it down but don't crank it if I am worried about it tearing. Then when I do my second knot closer to the ovary, I really crank that one. That way if you tighten too hard on knot #2 and tear the pedicle you've got the first one as backup, and if it holds you know you've got good security.

Echoing suture size, and I do a strangle or Millers knot. There is a lot of confusion about Millers, Modified-Millers, so just double check which one you are using. A true Modified-Millers has poorer security.

Here's a paper: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25148099/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25148099/)Another vote for Idexx. I would buy the machines outright if you can. Their contracts are OK but lock you in for a long time, and you have to endure their price increases all the time. They are the more expensive option for sure. The VS2 is just a veterinary model of a human machine (Piccolo) and their quality/durability is quite good, but Zoetis customer support is not. They are significantly cheaper though.EVERYONE has rough spays. It may be ""routine"" but it is a major surgery! There aren't too many others we do in GP that involve removal of an entire abdominal organ.

Try to refocus on what went well. You made a successful abdominal approach. You found the uterus. You isolated the ovaries, pedicles and body, and removed them. You identified the problem, explored the abdomen, appropriately monitored the patient after the complication, and the patient went home safely. Don't let one step overshadow all the wins in this surgery!

One of the private hospitals I worked at payed pretty well but management was terrible. Finding a smaller privately owned hospital was a God send for me, they 100% care more about the patients/clients as well as employees. It can be tough to find a non toxic work environment when your working in vet med but it's worth searching for. I was at my last hospital for 7 years and it had become very toxic, the manager would throw temper tantrums and only cared about money, including when it came down to your own personal pets. I spent about 6 months searching and asking tons of questions to potential new employers and finally found a small, privately owned practice with 100% employee discount... let me tell you, chances are if they're taking good care of their employees they're going to take good care of their patients as well.","Veterinarian.

watermelon-milkshake,"I’m going to have to agree with those saying OP is making generalizations based on one person’s bad experience in vet school and not based on a real general consensus.

Generally speaking, my instructors and classmates in vet school could not have been less toxic. Certainly there were instructors who had bad attitudes and/or sometimes set unreasonable standards for students to meet, but those were few and far between and you learn how to navigate their presence. For the most part everyone recognizes how challenging this profession is and help with concepts and support from classmates abound.

Perfectionism is rampant among veterinary professionals but most people get pretty good at managing these tendencies once they’ve been out of vet school for a year or two. Once you’ve been in the “real world” practicing as a licensed doctor you will quickly learn that it is impossible to be perfect and you are only hurting your own mental health in trying to be so.

Speaking as a wildlife veterinarian, there is absolutely no way that any veterinary school could provide classes that go deep into topics on every taxonomic group (and still manage to cover all the important anatomy/physiology/pharmacology/medicine topics required for medicine in any species) and I’m glad they don’t try. Dog, cat, cow, and horse medicine is the bread and butter of veterinary schools because most people who are there will be primarily working on these species, and those who won’t will base much of the medicine they practice on the concepts learned about these species. I would never be able to work on a tiger if I weren’t comfortable with house cat medicine. The same goes for avian/fish/herps/etc. - most of what we do with these groups is based on what we know about domestic species. There are many schools which do provide excellent training opportunities (didactic courses, rotations, research experience) for those with special interest in wildlife/zoo/zca/aquatics, and even if your school does not provide much of this you still have the opportunity to gain experience while in school through externships and/or summer jobs and attending conventions. This is also a great way to network as training programs and jobs in wildlife/zoo/zca/aquatics/aquaculture are among the most highly competitive and making connections is a good way to break down some of these barriers. The “real” training to prepare you for being comfortable with working on nondomestic species is through internship and residency. And even the 4+ years of specialized post-doc training requires much discipline and drive to study outside of your clinical responsibility (on your days off) in order to be prepared to sit boards to specialize. In short - this lack of experience is on you. Sorry.

Yes, there are many ignorant people who do not see veterinarians as “real doctors”. This should have come as no surprise. There are plenty of jobs where you do not face this sort of speculation regularly, and it’s your choice to let this bother you anyway. If I concerned myself with the opinions of all the ignorant people who speculate about my occupation I would go absolutely mad. The people who matter will see you as a “real doctor”, I promise. 

I work many long days (and nights and weekends). The reality of the schedules worked by many veterinarians also should not have come as a surprise to you. If you are considering working in a field like aquatics or aquaculture, much like in the rest of the zoo/wildlife/exotics world you will absolutely be expected to take some on-call shifts and work weekends throughout your specialty training and career. Depending on your job you may be working with high-profile animals (or those considered food animals) in which case many ailments are considered emergencies, meaning you have some long days ahead of you. However, even in jobs where nights or weekends are worked, a healthy work/life balance is absolutely achievable. It just takes practice and good time management skills. Having to write records at home varies from job to job but I would argue that this is less often the case and largely depends on the individual. I’m actually not allowed to write records at home in my current position. Some of my friends who practice elsewhere write records at home and many do not.

I’m sorry you’ve had such a negative experience in school. Vet school can be challenging in many ways, but it does not have to be like this forever.  Being a veterinarian offers ample opportunity to have a successful career in a variety of fields. I hope you find your happiness.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

Aware_Swordfish_6452,"Don't let one bad or toxic workplace ruin your vet med career for you. You did the whole education, you worked to this point.
You are describing a horrible workplace you should leave asap. I don't think talking to the owner/boss will change much. I've seen it lots of times: a lot of promises but they don't put it in writing so it's not valid.

Keep searching for a good clinic or practice. There are good managers, there are good clients, there are bosses who dare to say 'we don't have the time or utilities to help you, we'll refer you to X' , there are places where you can learn and grow.
Don't quit vet med before you try out other options.

And if you really don't like practice, check out the other options of your degree. A veterinarian can work for the private sector like pharmaceuticals, food etc, or for the government for food safety.

Don't give up, I believe in youI like your Facebook page already, keep up the good workI would not advise you to go to Belgium.

I can only speak from a small animal perspective, but all the big corporations (Anicura, Evidensia, Nesto, etc) promise you a lot but give you little and try to keep you bound to them.

In Belgium, >95% of vets are zelfstandige/freelancer, and are paid between 20-30eu/hour for starters. This rate would be nice if you are on payroll, but as a zelfstandige, it's really not a lot. For comparison, as a zelfstandige it is advised to have an accountant. My accountant charges 85€/h. So I need to work 2.5-3h to pay my accountant 1 hour (of course not counting any vat/taxes/etc for your pay).  
In the Netherlands, you can be a zelfstandige or ZZP'er, they are often paid a lot better (heard things of 70€/h). But mainly, most vets in the Netherlands are on a payroll, which I would advise you to do unless you want to start your own practice/clinic/service.

To clarify about the Corporations binding you: they pay shit and they will tell you right in your face that you are not worth more, even though you will make clients pay 5-10x more for your service than what you get from the corportation in hourly fee.  
But the main thing is that they try to bribe you (convince you the low pay is worth it) with continued education e.g. ESAVS. ESAVS is amazing, worth a lot, but hella expensive. So either you have to work for the corporations for x amount of years, or if you quit sooner, you have to repay them. And we are talking about education worth 4-5 numbers (€XX XXX)

Don't know any details about Germany.

For your last question: I've heard of them but most are either via a corporation or an internship. You're better of working for an experienced vet who wants to learn you things than keep on getting education from people that are no longer active in the fieldOh but that's a whole other story! Then the options are a lot better, and paid a lot better.

But no matter what sector you choose to work is, clinical or pharma or whatever, just remember this:

Working as a zelfstandige is only really interesting if you either earn a loooot of money (100€/h or more) or if you own your own company/service. Not like in the clinics in Belgium where you are paid hourly and low wage (schijnzelfstandigheid, mag eigenlijk niet maar bon).
In all other cases, get payroll en have the courage to ask for a raise if you are doing a good job","Veterinarian. Explanation: This comment was labeled ""Veterinarian"" because it discusses various aspects of veterinary practice, including surg",Veterinarian

May be worth considering a different approach -- hire some relief veterinarians and see if any of them mesh well on a mutual basis.  
  
I know a fair number that dip their toes in a hospital, end up falling in love with the hospital, and then elect to make that hospital a dedicated commitment or even accept employment through them.I'll echo what others have said here, it's kinda a bit that way no matter where you go with regards to interpersonal politics and drama playing an oversized role in how 4th year goes for you. I felt like there was an added quality of life boost if you're a guy, the bar or expected requirements seemed lower.Some of it is probably how you approach it.

from_the_box,"Hi there, I’m a 3rd year surgery resident! 
Everything Asleep_leopard said here is true. We’ve been through 12+ years of *you must be perfect to move forward* type education. We have never gotten off easy for a missed thing, so we’re type A and seriously anxious about the minute details because the blame always falls to us. And once we’re in practice… what you do is on our license. 

So, what we want from our team is that level of buy-in. We want you to have pride in doing your job right and understanding that whether you do it right can have an impact on patient survival, complications etc. I have so much knowledge to share, but if I have to keep explaining why it’s important and you don’t want to work to improve your own knowledge to improve our care… I will resent it. I need to trust you. If I can’t see you care and or try to improve, then I won’t trust you and will feel like I have to do it myself for safety purposes. And surgeons like doing surgery, we don’t want to do prep and anesthesia and instrument care but if we can’t trust others to do it we will and then get crusty about it. 

In return for your buy-in, I will fiercely advocate for your wellbeing, work-life balance, pay etc. that might be only me because I believe in balance over profit/cutting that one extra case can’t be an everyday thing. But good teams are worth their weight in gold. Not just figuratively but actually in surgery. Efficiency and quality = money, and I can’t cut without a team to do anesthesia and prep etc. Get paid and get out on time. Older surgeons are often not as good at that part. 

Things you can do… read some texts on surgical sterile prep and instrument care. There’s a whole chapter in Tobias (Veterinary Surgery 2nd edition) on instruments and prep and suture and whole texts on it too. Read about procedures - again, textbooks help here but so do pages online from ACVS or other clinics. There’s a book on local anesthesia if you might be learning blocks. And there are tech courses at ACVS conference and through companies to learn more. If you like surgery, negotiate with your job to send you to them. Essentially- if you can predict what we need because you know about the procedure, it will make everything flow better.Also we are generally really interesting but introvert people. We live hard/work hard. We are normal people underneath the big scary intimidating professional title. Chat up your surgeon while they’re closing! Talk about music playlists, be a human. Ask questions about procedures. BUT if we’re concentrating or things are hairy you gotta be cool with suspending the conversation/us being brusque and short or saying *not right now*. ABC communication in emergencies (accuracy, brevity, clarity). And things can shift in an instant to *this is now very very serious*. And then 10 minutes later we’re like “so how about them Yankees?” Like we never stopped chatting. Don’t take that personally, it’s just part of the job.Go to ACVS.org and read the residency training standards and requirements. They also have a list of approved/registered programs. You will have to move to one of these places and live there 3 years+ 
Do a paper during vet school or intern year. It will make you a better candidate in match and reduce your stress about qualifying to sit boards.

Hating_Life666,"According to the instruction guide (on pg 2), we have access to an electronic version of the exam resource guide during the test, so it shouldn't be an issue. I'm also immigrating into Ontario after graduation this year and planned on reading through it and then studying things listed in the clinical practice section of the resource guide with my own notes/vet school resources.It really depends on the area of vet med and where you choose to practice. I've prioritized finding a 9-5 M-F general practice with no weekends or on call work, even though I might not make as much money. You'll find some specialties have a better work-life balance (maybe dermatology, sports medicine/rehabilitation, etc. versus internal medicine or surgery) but it varies widely. If you want to have good work-life balance, you can make it work if you find the appropriate place.They will probably ask about your past experiences with animals, what you are comfortable with, what you are expecting to get out of the experience/your goals, how comfortable you are around clients, etc. Be honest and show enthusiasm. If it is for shadowing, you likely won't do much hands-on interaction with animals anyways for legal purposes. The most important aspects about shadowing are being willing to learn, asking questions *at appropriate times*, learning how to communicate effectively, and getting a feel for vet med. Don't forget you are also interviewing the practice to make sure they are a reputable place to learn from.An experienced vet tech at your job will be invaluable to you.  For just starting out, focus on being able to safely handle animals and communicate effectively. Fear Free has lots of great resources - you might want to just familiarize yourself with handling/restraining animals appropriately and knowing the signs of an animal being stressed/anxious/etc. Don't be afraid to say ""I'm uncomfortable with this animal or with this situation"" because it will happen, and you are far better off having someone with experience show you how to handle a situation then fumble through it and possibly get hurt. The rest will fall into place with time and experience.I'm on rotations now and while I have a position already, there are plenty of my classmates who are just starting to look and plenty of them are taking days off of rotation to do interviews. I think most people are just staying in our school's limit of absences to not have to make days up for interviews.I'm a 4th year student in veterinary school who came into this field after having a career in substance abuse/psychology. When I started gaining veterinary experience, I approached practices asking to shadow/observe. I got into one place and after almost a year of a ton of shadowing, they offered me an assistant position. I also got experiences applying to programs like RAVS (Rural Area Veterinary Services) and World Vets. It took me about 2 years from starting my pre-requisites and veterinary experiences to getting into/start vet school. My previous career has helped me immensely - I am very comfortable with difficult client conversations and find many ways to apply those skills to this field. Gaining shadowing experience is so critical, not just for gaining the experience for applications, but also to make sure you want to enter this field. I wouldn't want to do anything else except vet med, but there are plenty of cons so just be sure that you are 100% invested in the long-haul of vet school and a career in the field.I ended up relocating part-way through my pre-vet ""journey"", so I ended up taking on a job as a waitress for most of my shadowing/assistant work. This gave me the flexibility to work in the early mornings/weekends then shadow in the afternoons/evenings while still making money (TBH, more money than I was as a counselor). I was busy all day, almost every day of the week but I was able to apply to and get into vet school faster since I really prioritized getting experience.I'm not sure where you are located, but where I am, there is no requirement to get a certification for veterinary assistant jobs. It was several years ago, but I printed out my resume and went into several local practices, requesting to shadow. I ended up shadowing at one place for almost a year and was then offered an assistant position with them. If you approach it from the perspective of shadowing/observation only, that might get you in the door and then open you up to a job somewhere.1) No, it should absolutely not be like that. Aseptic technique is absolutely important and while you certainly could see some differences (i.e. a shelter using sterilized reusable surgical gowns versus new disposable sterilized gowns for procedures), no one should be putting a dirty needle that touched the floor into a vein. 

2) I would personally try to hold out for something at a different practice, but I can understand the urgency needed to find some place. IF you do decide to go with this practice, I would take everything with a large grain of salt and not let yourself form any bad habits that you may observe, based off of your description.I'm in the same boat...I imagine the wrong PDFs are being uploaded to the dashboard versus the information on the actual PDF being wrong? But I'm just speculating and hopeful that is the case.I think the point is being missed here.

PurpleSludgey737,"I'm a PM in the US. We head hunt 3rd and 4th year students who have excellent references from their professors. We then offer a contact to work for us for 5-10 years (depends on your production once employed) in exchange for paying for the 3rd and/or 4th year of school, along with a 10-20k relocation bonus of which students normally put 10-5k towards their school debt. There is a huge need here, and practices are willing to help you if you perform well in school, interview well, and pass the NAVLE. 

Learning the ins and outs of production and evaluating what a potential practice offers in terms of support, education, and estimate padding without financially castrating your client base should be a high priority for all new veterinary students. Also, never accept an offer from a practice that has negative production accrual, or you will fall even deeper into debt and be chained to the practice forever. A standard production percentage for new grads is 21-22%, paid out either monthly or quarterly. Many new grads put this towards their debt their first few years practicing. Make sure your first practice is run appropriately ie- will you receive production for rx's refilled, rx diets sold, etc? The answer should be yes.

&#x200B;

Wish you the best! We need you out here :\]Yes and the non compete part is huge! I've interviewed so many DVMs who are traveling 10, 15, sometimes 25 miles away from their home due to signing a contract with a non compete - and yes, many of them (but not all) are corporate. 

&#x200B;

OP - corporate practices and private practices have pros and cons;

Corporate Pros - huge capex bucket for repairs and maintenance and the newest technology, great rates with their primary labs that your PM can trickle down to your clients, pet funds for financially constrained pet parents, fully paid travel and sign up for CE events, a huge HR team accessible to all if you feel that something unjust is happening, a large network of hospitals to barrow LVTs or DVM from if you are short staffed, if you're having a bad quarter there is no threat of shutting the practice down because the corporate overlord will pay your bills until you are up on your feet again, etc.

Corporate Cons - red tape that hinders everything from the hiring process to changing your hospital's core values,  a lack of flexibility for DVM PTO usage, highly restrictive staffing ratios, strictly enforced overtime policies for your staff, pay range caps that cannot be challenged, etc. 

Private Pros - Your PM is truly in charge of your hospital from culture to hiring and more, normally having a direct line to the practice owner should serious concerns arise, supreme flexibility when it comes to schedule and PTO, in a good practice the money coming in is then distributed amongst the staff in the form of discretionary bonuses, you have the freedom to more easily terminate abusive clients, and in my experience you tend to have deeper ties to your local community, etc.

Private Cons - The practice normally lives and dies by the availability and patient capacity of the clinic & DVMs, a bad quarter or a DVM retiring will mean layoffs, if the hospital owner or PM are toxic then there is no HR to go to for solutions, 2nd or 3rd generation technology due to having normal opposed to deep pockets, most repairs are a PM or owner trying to fix the broken thing until it is officially ready for the garbage, if you get sued then you do not have the financial backing to fight something in court forever, etc.

( boss just has high standards)  do you have any education? reception or assistant or kennel staff is an option.which muppets would you eat first and whyyou would need to be trained as an LVT to administer and monitor anesthesia as well as dental radiology in a variety of species ( whereas  you only deal with 1 species lol) - animal teeth are much different than humans and get different diseases.  also,  this just doesn't happen. occasionally vets work with dentist for root canals or specialty stuff but LVT's are trained and can specialize in animal dentistry.when people tell you stuff- take notes.  

be quiet, listen and ask a lot of questions- and take notes.

 don't wear perfume and be quiet with cats and dogs . and FFS do not lean down into dogs  faces- just give animals space and don't be all into their faces. I can't tell you how many new people get bit in the face for being idiots. animals are scared at the vet, even if you can't tell and can bit without warning. you won't be able to truly get animal body language for years, so until then just keep your hands to yourself

watch Jackson Galaxy  and Sofia Yin videos on YouTube

muzzle any dog you are not comfortable with no matter what anyone says. I worked for 18 years and was never bit. I would get giant pit bulls we never saw before I muzzled them because  it doesn't hurt their feelings and I felt better ( we saw a lot of pitfalls because we ear crop- not my choice but whatever)

learn Fear Free and Cat Friendly practices- this will take you a year or two but you'll be a better human if you take those to heart.

lastly use food and treats to distract. if your clinic uses them- embrace them, if they don't come back and ask about it

don't expect everyone to welcome you with open arms. its a very stressful job and a new person is time consuming/ and draining to train, even worse when they know nothing. yes they want you there but it could take up to a year to prove that you're trustworthy. I spent many years training just for people to quit after a month because they didn't understand what vet med actually was.In Michigan you can start at 18+ an hour. Do you speak Spanish?

Seriy tho, mainland USA of good pay and even signing bonuses, much better than therea bilingual vet tech can probably yield moreI left 5 years ago at $21.5 per hour, and since everyone got a big raise . there is a shortage of LVT's and finally getting paid better to attract them.most girls have roommates or husbands. rent here is based on 2 income households unfortunatelyAs a long time vet tech I support this because :

1. We can all learn from each other
2. New grads can be terrible/awkward/wrong in exam rooms
3. Also the support staff details be monitored, these are people you are trusting to do the right thing with the clients

I suggest embrace it.

We have 1 vet ( 8 doctor practice) who was awesome at explaining and had the analogies and I wish the doctors could observe that 

And we have another vet  who sucks at exams, misses things and don't exam everything. And there's nothing we can do, even when the client calls and asked about something they missed.

HardSnurge,"You are describing possible outcomes, but not likely ones.  
Even in the extremely unlikely event that authorities contacted you about traffic at your IP, you do have your node interface, including connectivity logs,  and huge amounts of proof that you are running a VPN node.  
In the same way as somebody driving above the speed limit, it is possible you will be caught and it does happen, but 99.99% of the time it doesn’t.  
For me personally, 99% of the time I’m not even in the same part of the country as my node, so can prove I wasn’t present when an activity occurred.  
In the crypto world this is referred to as FUD. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10pw1a0/why_would_anyone_volunteer_to_be_an_exit_node/j6mjvq3/  You are correct about the logs, but I'm not certain why that is a ""key  thing there""?

In fact the key thing is the whole point. i.e. you can prove that you didn't perform the activity, but you can't tell them who did. Nobody can. That's the whole point. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10pw1a0/why_would_anyone_volunteer_to_be_an_exit_node/j6mm3en/  You are correct, but you will fail your responsibility as you can prove you weren't the user, but have no way of finding out who did. And you can prove it is impossible to know.

Same as Tor nodes or any ""theoretically"" non logging VPN service. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10pw1a0/why_would_anyone_volunteer_to_be_an_exit_node/j6mn4id/  Before that failure, however, let’s go back a few steps.

When you are questioned about “suspicious activity” on your IP address, you would of course ask how the authorities know about this.

They would explain that they have been “monitoring” your IP. You would ask to see the warrant giving them permission to wiretap. They probably won’t have one, in which case you can now pursue them for illegal interception.

If they do, then you can ask to see the court transcripts for the application. If it doesn’t precede the date of the offence, then they have obtained a warrant illegally and you should sue them.

If it does, then you can ask to see the evidence upon which this wiretap was obtained. If it doesn’t exist, which it won’t, then you can sue them for obtaining a wiretap based on no evidence.

If they do have evidence that proceeds the wiretap authority, then you are a criminal and should be imprisoned.

What we all know, of course, is that the government, still monitors all traffic illegally (since Snowden), they can at no time admit this and so will never pursue minor infractions or pursue anybody that forces them down a path where they have to admit illegal activity.

Also, since Snowden, almost all traffic passing through the Internet is secured. Most is secured at the traffic level, meaning that it is still possible to use meta data to infer illegal content. However much of the Internet is adopting TLS (Transport Layer Security) meaning no traffic is able to be decrypted, meaning no analysis is possible (either Meta or otherwise).

In all but one scenario above, what we are describing is illegal activity being actioned by authority organisations that we pay and employ. In this case, the authorities themselves should be taken to court and those responsible should be imprisoned. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/10pw1a0/why_would_anyone_volunteer_to_be_an_exit_node/j6mrgps/  I think that is the same for most countries. But they still have to prove it is you.

Think of the client (your customers) experience. 

As a service provider, say your node was very close to it's daily limit. You then have a client connect. After a few MB of data, suddenly either no traffic flows, or they get disconnected.

Vet techs and doctor are not the same whatsoever.We dont but we offer to send the body to a 3rd party crematoriumThank you, this is very encouraging, this is my first vet job and so idk if this is the “norm” or what but it’s discouragingI do alot of things that aren’t my job, like carrying dead animals that clients are bringing in for cremation.. which isnt my job eitherWhat exactly goes on during an exam? From what i understand thats just a office visit and they just look at your pet?Im a csr at a vet hospital and i was not trained on how to restraint or anything but i also do not do anything like that. What pisses me off is that we have had csr’s do DOA and grab the animals from the client, we do not open the fridge and put them in their but I believe it is a tech thing, whether one is available at the moment or notI loathe talking to Drs tbh. Especially one we have and it just feels like you have to walk on egg shells. I would definitely ask if you could go be a receptionist but they also ask us to make requisitions and carry dead animals in.. which is not our job.

m00-shroom,"This is a complete guess, but maybe another thing along the lines of it not being diluted properly. 

Do you dilute it in a huge batch at night, then pour it in individual bottles in the morning? Maybe the rescue separates a bit at night and then when you're pouring in the bottles the concentration is stronger.Hmm that’s not an especially strong solution, seems right. It could be that you’re getting the irritation from the concentrated stuff while you’re diluting it (i.e. some of it sprays up while you’re pouring). 

I’m not sure, I’m hoping someone else here will know a bit more about it.

Warrioryote,"First of all, congratulations in advance! It’s an exciting time getting to go out and take the first job! Don’t feel bad about being nervous or unprepared. It’s a lot to keep track of and it’s your first time doing it. Some practices may try to take advantage of that, but everyone has had their ‘first time’ doing this, and there are plenty of practices out there that will appreciate that and be supportive, even given the employee/employer dynamic. Many doctors and practices enjoy the opportunity to mentor and share the profession with new grads. 

I’ll try to limit my response to something additive to what’s already been posted, those are good replies with additional great advice. IMO first thing is to look at yourself as the asset you are. Practices don’t run without doctors and they’re hiring because they need you. You’re an essential piece of the business, even if you don’t feel like it yet. Even though you don’t have the most clinical experience out of everyone in the room, you -are- bringing with you the most up to date knowledge as a new grad, and experienced doctors know they can learn from you too, not just the other way around. It’s not something to flaunt, but being aware of that may help with confidence during the process. 

Veterinary medicine is a rewarding, but challenging and emotionally demanding work environment. Work culture is a -huge- part of everyone’s job satisfaction, so making sure you feel like it’s a team you want to work with before you bite is an essential part of the interview process. 

Little things like electronic vs written records, scheduling, whether or not you can request stocking meds you prefer to work with,  and big things like a commitment to mentorship and training can be everything for whether you love or hate the job. Think of the interview less as you being in the hot seat, and more as a way to get to know the hospital you’re looking at. You can say no too if you get bad vibes and feel like it’s not the right fit for you.

I’d recommend writing out a list of things that are important to you in your job. Some things are obvious, like how many days a week are you going to be asked to work, or will you work weekends or on call. Some are less so, such as ‘do you have a quiet place to call clients’. They’re interviewing you, but you’re also interviewing them to see if it’s a right fit for you.  List questions and bring them with you to the interview. Everyone loses if you and your hospital don’t mesh so it’s in everyone’s best interest for you to try and find somewhere else if you don’t feel confident it’s where you want to be. 

Which brings me to this - ASK those questions about all of these things. Show interest in the staff and talk to them if it’s a working interview/if you’re touring the practice and there’s an opportunity. If you see things that interest you, ask about them. If you encounter something that seems like a deficit, eg: a practice that doesn’t have point of care ultrasound and that’s important to you, there’s an opportunity to say it’s something you’d like to do in practice and see if it’s an option to work towards that in the future. 

It’s important to think about salary and benefits and what’s important to you. Depending on the hospital you deal with, some might spring offers or questions about what you’re looking for during an initial interview. Most will not bring this up until they’ve discussed the interview and are presenting an offer after the fact though - ie: salary and benefit negotiation is something that usually happens after the interview and they’re wanting to move forward with a hire. If you do get that sprung on you when you’re not ready, don’t give specific numbers. You need time to review and consider things like final salary, ancillary benefits etc. and you can tell them to make you an offer - ultimately those details should be offered on paper, not by word of mouth. Do have an idea of the BALANCE of salary, benefits, PTO, weekends/on-call, signing bonus etc. that are important to you to engage on those questions if they happen, though. 

The AVMA has a new grad expected salary calculator by state and specialty on its website - it’s a guideline, not a given, and things like better hours or benefits may correlate with a salary that is lower than this guideline (and that may be worth it for a job you love to go to every day) - but this can at least give you a ballpark of what you can expect so you don’t accidentally undervalue yourself. 

If you have resources at your school for placement, reach out to them. Some schools will provide local business information where you are looking, some will even help arrange mock interviews to get the jitters out before you go to the real deal. These take extra time and effort to utilize, but they can make a huge difference in helping you land the perfect job. 

Lastly, when you do get that job offer - and you will, don’t decide immediately. Don’t waste a practice’s time, either. My school gave a guideline of a 72 hour yes or no window, but taking the time to have a contract reviewed, soul search your priorities, and negotiate changes is reasonable, and in many cases expected. If there’s something you don’t see on a contract that is important to you, and reasonable to request, make sure you ask for it. You may not get it, but if you don’t ask you definitely will not. Eg: if downtime or vacation is really important to you, and you think you’ve found the perfect job, but they’re only offering 2 weeks vacation.  Don’t ask for 5, you’re probably not getting it and it’ll sound wild. But saying ‘vacation time is important to my work life balance, is there room to increase that some?’ Is reasonable and may be something they’re willing to agree to in order to seal the deal. Keep in mind that this specific request (more PTO) can affect your ability to hit production if you’re on a pro-sal or similar pay system. Substitute your priorities for pto here as you will. 

Most of all, try to enjoy the process. You’re embarking on an awesome new chapter of your life and interviewing is an opportunity to explore what’s out there. Best of luck!","Other.

I hope someone with knowledge would be able to give the best answer on this. I really wonder if its safe to do and if it is how?But what if someone goes into ""illegal"" websites or anything illegal. Its gonne be your IP address visiting those websites. How do you prevent that?Do you know how can I monitor the traffic thru the node?Sorry to hear that but that sounds more like your carelessness. They have a document about that. If you are living in U.S or Germany or U.K you should not enable ""Public"" 

I have AdGuard Home setup on my pi zero, I guess I can check the traffic thru there thank you for the advice.

https://docs.mysterium.network/faqYou should not have any problems if you turn ""Public"" off. My node has been up for 1 month and never had any problems yet. 

Second, I also want to turn Public on but I have to read and understand very well on ""how to run an exit node"" https://dvpnalliance.org/exit-node/

This is their original guide on how to run an exit node. 

There are deffinitely  important information in that guide.How are you able to reach 50-100 MYST with one node?Hmm. Okay I appreciate the answer. Its been 11 hours and 58 minutes. Only 2.87MB used. That's very interesting.I did a clean pi OS installation and it seems to be working normal right now. Made 5 mysts in the past 4-5 days. 

How do you see it on your wallet tho? When I put the transaction ID on etherscan nothing shows. Even when I put my wallet address on etherscan I still can't see any transactions. 

I check my metamask wallet and I don't see any myst either. But when I check the node it gives me a Transaction Id with the date and time. Where did the tokens go?Okay. Thank youthe external address is the same as my metamask wallet address. I didn't do anything specific. Do I need to do anything specific?

When I log into metamask I only see; ETH wallet address that is it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:

So when I go to Bridge section in Metamask, It gives me an option to transfer tokens from one network to another.

When I select Polygon (From this network) I can see my MYST tokens around 4 MYST tokens which is about a dollar.

But when I click the Metamask extension on google chrome I do not see any myst tokens. All I see is

0 ETH.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

Somehow I managed to do it. I went to metamask portfolio then I select Bridge. Over there I clicked ""Switch networks in Metamask"" > Then I select Polygon. After that I was able to see it in my portfolio. I clicked Myst in my portfolio then I clicked ""Add to metamask"" 

Now I am able to see my Myst tokens in metamask.the external address is the same as my metamask wallet address. I didn't do anything specific. Do I need to do anything specific?

When I log into metamask I only see; ETH wallet address that is it.

I have AdGuard Home setup on my pi zero, I guess I can check the traffic thru there thank you for the advice.

Second, I also want to turn Public on but I have to read and understand very well on ""how to run an exit node"" https://dvpnalliance.org/exit-node/

This is their original guide on how to run an exit node.

How do you see it on your wallet tho? When I put the transaction ID on etherscan nothing shows. Even when I put my wallet address on etherscan I still can't see any transactions. 

I check my metamask wallet and I don't see any myst either. But when I check the node it gives me a Transaction Id with the date and time. Where did the tokens go? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/183y04w/only_936_kib_in_4_hours/kc0deh6/  Okay. Thank you ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/183y04w/only_936_kib_in_4_hours/kaubvs6/  the external address is the same as my metamask wallet address. I didn't do anything specific. Do I need to do anything specific?

When I log into metamask I only see; ETH wallet address that is it.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

EDIT:

So when I go to Bridge section in Metamask, It gives me an option to transfer tokens from one network to another.

When I select Polygon (From this network) I can see my MYST tokens around 4 MYST tokens which is about a dollar.

But when I click the Metamask extension on google chrome I do not see any myst tokens. All I see is

0 ETH.

&#x200B;

EDIT 2:

Somehow I managed to do it. I went to metamask portfolio then I select Bridge. Over there I clicked ""Switch networks in Metamask"" > Then I select Polygon. After that I was able to see it in my portfolio. I clicked Myst in my portfolio then I clicked ""Add to metamask""

I have no idea if my scores really were correct, and I told my entire family I had passed... having a hard time coping. I know stressing about it won't make a difference, but I can't help itNow they have taken my score down from the NEB CVMA portal... anyone else from Canada with the same issue?I still have the no documents available message!Canadians/international students: scores available through the NEB portal.Yeah, I'm terrified honestly. Counting every minute and stressed out of my mind.Did you just get this email? Or was it earlier in the day before all hell broke loose?My NEB scores still aren't up :(Well, what makes me calmer is that on the NEB website the date that I sat the exam was right next to the score.

Since the problem was with ICVA releasing switched up reports, I am just guessing they sent out the wrong PDFs to each candidate on the ICVA portal, but the computed score results that get sent to the NEB must be from a simple database, since no score report is given on NEB.

This is all that soothes my head at the moment and in no way am I certain about this. Just so that I can sleep.

BTW: I had already told the whole family that I passed, and now am embarrassed to tell them that there is a possibility, however small, that I didn't.Going through the NEB process through CVMA. Still no scores.I sincerely hope you pass and get a great job right away! The FASS papers gave me a good laugh though hahaThank you so much! I hope you pass and never have to worry about this againYou gave me some hope, god blessThey sure are taking their sweet ass time, so I am assuming they screwed up big time aswell. I am starting to doubt that they will fix it by today.I have seen that they constantly email some people and not others, or there is a massive delay between each candidate receiving said emails. But yeah, they sent it and assured that by 5pm it would be fixed and they would email us. Not so sure I trust them now.But in my case, the date was correct, so I am assuming that my score was real... I think...Can they still login and see it or did they just see it that one time shortly after it was released?I believe it is, since it got my test date correct.Hopefully it means that they are close to sorting out the issue... if the results do come in, let us know!

I cannot uninstall it as it doesn't appear in the list of programs in Dolphin.  I haven't even started as it's not worth it to pay first to help the network.

I mean, I pay for hardware, eclectricity and internet connection, besides the risk of being an end node and they want me to also pay something to join???

They gotta be kidding me! ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/udt839/turned_off_my_node_today/i6jxdwa/  How about they pay themselves from what I earn and they owe me?

Why it doesn't work that way? ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/udt839/turned_off_my_node_today/i6k3i76/  What are you talking about?

Nobody pays after first hour or first day, there's always a threshold after which they are paid.

So even if 1M people start nodes today nothing will happen as only those who contributed for a least a week or a month (depending on the threshold) will be paid.

If somebody doesn't reach that minimum threshold it's simply not paid and it contributed for nothing, all it was like a donation and nothing was lost on the devs side.

So I don't see any risk on the devs side and because of that it makes no sense to me to ask for a fee to join. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/udt839/turned_off_my_node_today/i6khx40/  Honestly I don't even care anymore, I lost all the faith in this project

The fact that they want to pay something to help the network besides the already risks of running a not is outrageous in my opinion.

I will never join anything where they want money for me when they should be the ones that pay me.

On the testnet there were no such thing, but also no payment. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/twpgt1/psa_moderators_are_censoring_posts_on/i3gr414/  To add a node.

DouglasTwice,"I also failed the first time after doing 100% of vetprep. I was trying to learn instead of memorize. It’s a memorization exam. You’re wasting your time trying to become a better vet through the navle. 


I switched to Zuku and I found that to be a bit better. VetPrep does a better job of explaining things but I found VetPrep tends to hyperfixate on some topics (why are there 500 questions on listeriosis?). The Zuku question bank is more diverse, IMO. 

Get accommodation if you can. Anxiety, ADD, ect all have a chance of being eligible for time accommodation and there’s no penalty for being turned down.The thing that surprised me the most about failing the navle for the first time is that absolutely nobody cares. It feels a bit embarrassing and your student cohort may gossip or whatever, but on a professional level nobody cares whatsoever. Everyone who has passed it has taken it, and most people who have taken it agree it’s pretty much valueless. 

In fact, if any vet professional or veterinary organisation thinks less of you for having resat the exam, that’s a huge red flag avoided.I wonder if there is a 6 hour computer science exam the ICVA can take?If I fail this exam again, I’m just gonna apply to work at the ICVA.

Good for you for having integrity!In some places, ER can cut things they are comfortable with and then call a surgeon if neededYes. Yes it is.A medical declaw (neoplasia, dysplasia, chronic infection. Etc) is a different thing that cosmetic one.  Perhaps frame it as a toe amputation vs a declaw will help?I can't speak for all clinics in urban GA but our cat only practice was slower last month (same as year before) but back to busy.  We have a doc 2 days a week, 2.5 days a week, and one 4 days a week if that helps.Post actual #s, I'm sus about any job that doesn'tGod forbid we earn closer to our worthFirst off, my first year I was VERY productive with minimal mentorship.  Not saying that is everyone.

Secondly, I didn't say that we were able to be paid that, just that veterinarians aren't paid their worth.

Third, if you made me guess based on numbers, the discrepancy between what corporate practices make off new grads vs what they earn is a lot, in favor of corporate.At Banfield (unfortunately, try not to judge lol) in TX in 2013 w a base of 70k and 19% production, made 140k.  Now I got my ass ran into the ground for it, sure.  We will never be able to pay doctors accordingly, because in this industry there is so much push back from the public if we raise prices.  Not to mention the guilt of knowing less animals are getting care.  Sorry business is down for you.  Corporate are also fucking over private ownership unfortunately.  There is just little way to compete.  Do you mind sharing your location? Are you small animal GP?  Do you have much competition around you? AFAIK the demand for vets was fairly less my 1st year out as well.Angry cats that let me love them :)I've seen situations where an animal is too fractious to approach ( ex I saw 2 cows who had been hit by a truck.  They couldn't walk anywhere but they were 100% conscious and impossible to get close to).  A firearm with proper safety was used with a secondary method once rendered unconscious.  This was a gun much larger than a pistol.  Now if there is a better option, I am unsure.AgreedThe cow was rendered senseless with the firearm, then euthanasia solution was given after to ensure death.  It's been 20+ years, it was during an externship.Especially with primates, they consult with physiciansIt gets better but never goes away.These techs are flat out rude.  If I heard them talking to one of my fellow vets like that I would have been pissed.Agreed! Sedated is good practice and only work to truly visualize tympanum if the case indicates it.You do get shit pay.  I encourage you to discuss salary with your colleagues to make sure you are all at least compensated equally.I'm proud of y'all for doing this.  Wish we had 11 yrs ago when I graduated. Power to the people!Hey, once you pass you are licensed.  We veterinarians are so in demand right now. I have a feeling that even if they found out they wouldn't care.I've always heard they're not enforceable.  However, I wouldn't feel comfortable breaking one without a lawyer.10+ years ago low debt for vet school was $250k, now it's much more.Get out ASAP. It gets better. I'm not saying it's the dream, but it's definitely better than that.It does get better, but I will tell you after 10+ years I still have imposter syndrome and will lay awake at night thinking of patients/cases.

I do think therapy or even a mentor/colleague you could vent to and find comfort in would be great.

Think of all the babies you are helping.  You got this. You are amazing.  All the knowledge is there, you just need to get more confidence, which comes with time.  In the end, we are all human and unfortunately mistakes happen.  I think it speaks to your character you care and are able to self reflect.Super low balledTime to go somewhere new where you are appreciated (& w good standard of care).  Don't forget YOU are in demand.  They can't run a clinic without YOU.  Don't let stress and anxiety keep you in a toxic place.  I've been there, if I hadn't gotten out, I would have been a statistic.  Our industry is hard enough as it is, free yourself from dead weight.I had a classmate leave the field and go to nursing school within 5 yrs of graduation.It's going to be hard. Really hard.Rad onc requires an onc residency followed by a rad onc residencyInteresting. A classmate did so I assumed it was the norm.   My bad.I had a come to Jesus my first semester.  I wondered is this really what I worked so hard for? I wanted this so bad, now I am just bending over and taking it?  It's about perseverance.  You worked so so hard to get in.  It's a rough wild ride, but you can do it.  Lean on your classmates who understand.  Remember, you know what they call the last person in your graduating class? DVM.

Good luck.  I don't know you, but I know you got this.  In 3.5 years we will be colleagues!My mentor used to say ""People who got A's specialize and people who got B's work for the people who got C's"" :)Depending on where you are, $90 is low to me.  If it's corporate practice, all bets are off.  I know it's a hard feeling watching some pets not get care due to prices.  Hurts my heart.  I wish I could just give all patients the care they need for free.  Unfortunately, a business needs to be profitable, I have a mortgage worth of debt to pay off, you have bills.  We have to live.  Many initial private hospitals can go under for simply under charging and their compassion hurting their bottom line.  Honestly, if I were to set a price of what my/our services cost based on our worth, it would be MUCH higher than we charge as a whole.  I'm not an owner and I wouldn't make costs undoable, simply stating if we were paid for our true value and expertise.  I want to stress, I do not think animals should just be for the privileged.  Unfortunately, it's just the state of our field.It was a hard lesson for me to learn, but I had to realize that no one is forcing my colleagues to stay. If they want to stay in a toxic work environment, that is their choice.  My mental health comes first.Hardest but best part of my job, I get to end suffering.  It still takes its toll, but knowing they're now peaceful because of a gift the owner and I gave, is priceless.  I cry at every one and usually go home to hold my babies.  I have refused euthanasia's in the past due to them being a convenience and not due to the suffering of an animal.I think universities would in general be a great job! Both a vet school and the lab. Other comments are right on bureaucracy still being there, but I find it more structured and better than private practice. Corporate is the worst.  Good luck.Tatted and multiple facial piercings.  I even worked w a DVM that had a neckpiece!Breathe. The knowledge is there in your head, you just have to trust your gut. We all felt like we did horrible, and yet around 138/140 of my US class passed.  You've got this.  Good luck!Mine is very similar to yours.Sedation is the gold standard for ALAR as you can use props to help position and step back vs holdWhen I was on production, I got it on all stuff on the bill when they checked out but not if they came in just to pick up/meds product.  Some clinic settings are so over booked there is no way I'd not do production.  Luckily that isn't the case w my unicorn clinic and I prefer to be flat salary so I don't have to think about $.  Do you know more about this clinic? Happy to help.I would avoid moving to Texas due to the laws.  I'm not going somewhere where I don't have reproductive rightsIt is even worse with organic producers. Believe it or notExactly. They put off treatment and antibiotics because it will no longer be an organic animal and they're trying to keep them in production as long as possible.Always extend that incision before the next vet gets there.

Also without knowing which ID you were dealing with, they can be hard to diagnose.  Live and learn and be better going forward.  You are doing great.  The fact you can self reflect makes you better than many.Buddy of mine does vaccine clinics (I don't know if w vetco though) he does a basic PE, councils if something obvious like ear infection, etc.  If an owner can't muzzle their own dog, they aren't seen (which I think is AWESOME).  He gets paid well since he bids on more rural areas.  He likes it bc he doesn't have to think about it when leaving his shift.  I do think a good para staff helping you will make things much smoother.I think if we did not do these clinics, the number of animals who have even been touched by a vet and vaccinated will go down drasticallyIt's much better to learn it's not for you early (if that ends up the case) vs after you've invested blood, sweat, tears, and a mortgage worth of debtNo","Veterinarian.

PrettyButEmpty,"If you are in the US, ACVS requires a rotating internship or equivalent (I think 5 years?) clinical experience in private practice. Realistically, this means that almost everyone who wants a surgical residency does an internship. Twofold: meeting the requirement, and possibly even more importantly making contacts with surgeons. Applying for residency requires you to submit letters of rec from ACVS diplomats. If you are out in practice for 5 years, and the only surgeons you know are your professors from school, it will be challenging to get the number and quality of letters that you need to successfully match. 

Given the competitive nature of surgical residencies, it is also common for applicants to complete 1 or more surgical internships, so I would also keep that in mind during your calculations.  

If you work in a position that allows you to maintain regular contact and good relationships with surgeons, an alternative path could be an option. But it’s an uphill battle, unfortunately. I have also heard it expressed by multiple surgeons that they prefer new doctors as residents as they are “less likely to have bad habits”, so I would also be leery of that bias harming you. 

In general, if you REALLY want to be a surgeon and you can financially swing it, going the internship route will probably give you the best shot. If you would be happy as an ER doctor you can still do a lot of surgery, and you can step out of vet school into a job paying easily 200k. I’m a surgeon; I love it and don’t regret my choices at all, but you need to really want it, and it definitely comes with some opportunity cost.No problem, happy to help. 

Publications can help, but mainly if they are relevant to surgery. A lot of people have undergrad research, which is great but falls more under the “positive extracurricular” category rather than being a big plus. 

Where research can help you is if you are doing it with one or more surgeons, who then know you and can write letters for you. Or if you manage to publish a paper that could essentially be a back up paper for your credentials. (When you finish your residency you will need to submit a collection of things to ACVS in order to be approved to take boards. One of the things you must submit is proof that you have completed and published a research paper in an approved journal contributing to the surgical literature. Normally this is a paper you have worked on as a resident, but if you have an acceptable paper from earlier in your career that can be used as well).Sometimes there are kittens, and no one looks at you oddly when you do things like put them down your shirt or pretend to eat their heads.8am EST, and you get your results by logging into the website. If you match, yay, someone from your future program will likely reach out in the next week to greet you and provide further information. 

If you don’t match you’ll enter what is called the scramble. You’ll be able to look at the list of programs with open positions, and will reach out by email to express your interest in any of those programs. It is a time sensitive process- while not matching can be emotionally difficult, this is a situation where you want to quickly consider your options, and assuming you wish to continue seeking an internship, jump right into reaching out to programs. Everyone else will be doing the same thing, so spots can go quickly and things are dynamic. You will also likely be contacted by programs interested in you, as a list of unmatched applicants is also provided to them. You’ll want to be ready to quickly vet those programs so you can let them know yes or no, before move on to the next option. 

Good luck!I only took the communication elective my school offered because my advisor taught it and I wanted to suck up. I was cringing through the majority because I also hate that stuff. 

… But I will admit, a couple years later when I was a lost little intern having to talk to a sobbing client about euthanasia for the first time ever, it was kind of reassuring to have a “script” to fall back on.I think, if you are still in undergrad, that you may be putting the cart before the horse a bit! Lots of people come into vet school wanting to be surgeons, and lots of people find that actually, cardiology, or shelter medicine, or dermatology really speaks to them and inspires a passion they had no idea existed! Or they realize that having to chose just one thing feels so limiting, and decide to go into GP to see a little bit of everything and simultaneously get to develop relationships with clients and patients that span the pet’s entire life. Or they realize clinical medicine and dealing with clients all day just really grates, and maybe being a pathologist or a radiologist is more their style. Vet school, and to a lesser extent internship is about trying different things and finding out what you really like, and I always encourage students to take advantage of those opportunities, because you just never know what will strike your fancy!

That said, some people come in wanting to be surgeons and that passion carries them all the way through! It is a competitive specialty, so if you think you want to be a surgeon, it will work in your favor to start taking steps in that direction from early in your vet school career. Figure out a way to make contacts with the surgery service at your school- is there an on call student position? Does someone need help with a research project? Is there a surgery club you could seek a leadership position in to work with the faculty advisor and plan wetlabs? Make those connections early, and work to maintain them- having those people to ask for advice, to help get you strong letters for the internship and residency match, and potentially to get involved with research is one of the most important things you can do to achieve your goals. 

Along with networking, the other thing you want to do as a preclinical student is work hard in class to develop a strong knowledge base and achieve good grades. Grades are not the only thing people look at when choosing residency candidates, but they do speak to a person’s test taking skill and diligence in preparing for exams, and as a surgeon you will be expected to pass a multipart board exam. They can also help give you an edge over other similar candidates if your grades are particularly good. 

During your fourth year you will be on clinical rotations, so moving between different services in the hospital as well as externships. Here is where you will be pulling everything together, so again you will want to work hard and put a lot into prepping for your cases. Usually that’s easy for people to do on surgery when they want to be surgeons, but remember you will also have to do surgery on diabetics, and talk to clients about their pet’s cancer diagnosis, and many surgeons don’t have access to an anesthesiologist for all their cases and will be overseeing their technicians instead. So what I’m saying is every rotation matters! 

Hopefully, if you’ve been working hard in your preclinical classes and you continue doing well in clinics, it shouldn’t be too hard to find people to write letters of recommendation for you. Because the other thing that happens in fourth year is the internship match. If you go on the VIRMP website (www.VIRMP.org) you can see what applying for internship looks like. You send in your transcript, put together a personal statement and CV, and most importantly have 3-4 of your faculty write you strong letters supporting your application. This is where those connections you have made with surgery people and your rockstar performance on clinics start to pay off. Usually you want to get letters from at least a couple different specialists (not ONLY surgeons) because this first application is for a rotating internship position. 

As a rotating internship you will move between services (kind of like for clinical rotations) but generally you spend most of your time on surgery, medicine, and ER with variable amounts of elective time depending on your program. As an intern you are a doctor, but you will generally have some level of supervision and people you can ask questions, and depending on the program you may not always have primary case responsibility just yet. It’s kind of a weird, in between time, but once again it provides time for you to gain more experience and confidence with managing cases and talking to clients, as well as making connections. Once again, when you start your rotating, reach out to the surgery department. See if someone is willing to be your mentor, and possibly guide you into completing a short research project during your internship, maybe also presenting it at a national conference. Those sorts of things, as well as working hard again to make sure you get strong letters, will help your second VIRMP application be as strong as possible. 

When you go through Match the second time, that’s when you’ll apply for the specialty match. Most people apply for both surgical internships and surgical residencies, just because it is highly competitive, and even with the strong application you’ve ideally been building matching to residency straight out of rotating internship isn’t guaranteed. Most people do 1-2 surgical internships before matching for residency. If you do match for internship rather than residency, use the time to address any gaps in your application. Push to complete that research project and get it published. Keep making new connections in the surgery world and maintain old ones. Work to improve your technical skills and case management. 

Most residencies are three year programs (I think there are a couple four year programs out there as well, where one year is spent completing your research project). As a resident you will primarily be responsible for seeing and cutting cases. You will see both soft tissue and ortho cases, and will also be expected to have exposure to neurosurgical cases to some degree. You will keep a log of your cases, ensuring that you are seeing enough volume and variety of cases. You will also regularly meet for didactic training- journal club, case reviews things like that, and you will be expected to prepare several talks and present to your peers over the course of your residency (like for grand rounds). You are expected to complete a research project during residency (even if you already have a publication) and you will receive time off clinics for that and for the handful of out rotations that are required (anesthesia, IM/critical care, pathology, radiology). Your paper must be accepted no later than the August after you finish residency and must be in an approved journal. It cannot be a case report. 

Residents take Phase I boards as second years, and can repeat it again as third years if necessary. At the conclusion of your residency you submit your logs documenting that you have met all required case numbers/out rotations/presentations/etc, submit your accepted research paper, and obtain a final set of reference letters from your mentors. Assuming those items are in order and you have passed Phase I, you then take Phase II the Feb after your residency (most people graduate in July). Once you pass Phase II…. You are finally a boarded surgeon! 

Easy, right?Spaghetti, I’ve worked with interns for 10 years now, after being one myself. Internship sucks. You go from being a student, where no one trusts you to do anything but the most basic of tasks, to all of a sudden being expected to be personally responsible for the well being of potentially very sick animals. Hopefully you have some degree of supervision/people you can ask, but it feels like everyone who’s supposed to be helping you is just annoyed with you. You’re constantly sleep deprived. You feel like you’re so busy running around and doing paperwork that you have no time to read up on things or review.

Plus, internship further distills the Type A, driven, perfectionist types who go to vet school into the MOST Type A, driven, perfectionist types. People who judge their own performance harshly and have a hard time accepting any deviation from the way they think things should be. You make mistakes because you’re a novice, or you’re tired, or maybe it’s not even a mistake and just a difference in how institutions treat certain types of cases, and you use those incidents to punish yourself. Because surely, if you were a GOOD doctor, internship would be easy, right? 

It’s your mind playing tricks on you. If you haven’t been kicked out, if you haven’t been sat down by the administrators and had any very serious discussions, if you haven’t been instructed that your cases have to be supervised differently and more closely than your internmates, then you’re probably at least doing fine. Odds are that other people don’t perceive you in the same way you’re seeing yourself. You are judging yourself against perfection. Others are judging you against the standard they expect from an intern. ALL interns make mistakes. ALL interns have gaps in their knowledge. ALL interns have limited procedural competence. You are there to learn and gain experience and grow as a doctor, and anyone who makes you feel bad about not being perfect right out of vet school is projecting their own issues onto you. 

It’s ok to hate your internship. Maybe you’re dealing with a lot of toxic people, maybe you really have no support, maybe you’re being treated as cheap labor and a just meat shield in ER. It’s ok to quit your internship if it’s not providing the experience you feel will help you get to where you want to be. But before you do that, I would do a couple things. 

1. Carve out some time to see a doctor. They will understand. They went through internship themselves, and if you look at any of the medical subs you’ll see that burn out and depression are just as common in human med. Ask about getting on medication to help interrupt some of the cycle of negative thoughts and emotions. 

2. Talk to your mentors. Who is supervising you? Is there anyone you trust to discuss these feelings of inadequacy with, someone who can give you an outside perspective? Someone who, if there are any specific things you need to improve, can give you advice about the best way to build your skills in those areas? 

3. Try to schedule time to see a therapist. Maybe look at virtual options to allow more flexibility. They can potentially help you identify patterns of thinking that are working against you and give you strategies to break these patterns. 

4. It’s so hard as an intern, but try to carve out a little time for yourself to do some of the things you used to like to do. Most interns have so little free time that their main hobbies become “catch up on sleep” and “do laundry”. When was the last time you went on a hike? Or cooked a special meal, or did a little knitting, or sketched something? I think during training it is so easy to become dissociated from the person you are outside of work, but maintaining some connection with that person really helps. 

Try some of these things, if you feel you can. And if you still feel like leaving your internship, that’s ok. It’s ok to say “this isn’t for me”. But I hope it will be after you’ve taken a fresh look at the situation with a clear head, and you’ve realized your life plan is going to be different. Not because you’re holding yourself to an impossible standard, and now you’re crumbling, feeling like you can’t meet it. It’s ok not to be perfect, and it’s ok to forgive yourself for not being perfect, as long as you learn from your mistakes. 

You’re not alone.You can also ligate the horns individually to prevent this.Well, if you’ve been mostly on research rotations so far, it’s probably true that your technical skills are behind your classmates who have been more consistently in the clinic. That’s ok. You’ve got a whole career ahead of you to work on your technical skills. Everyone freaks out about being bad at things like blood draws- honestly, it won’t matter. You’ll catch up, and depending on the staffing of your clinic you may not even be doing it that often. I can’t remember the last time I drew blood; my technicians always pull blood/place IVCs/etc. Not saying your shouldn’t practice, but no one is going to ask you to demo your venipuncture skills in a job interview. 

Physical exam skills are where you should pay more attention. That will matter, and that is a skill to work on. Again, it will take time, but EVERY opportunity you have to put your hands on an animal, do it. Palpate bellies, listen to hearts, test reflexes, flex joints… work on building up an index of “normal” in your head so you can get better at picking up abnormal. Practice on your own pets. Get there early to examine all the inpatients/drop offs. Make notes and compare with the doctor on the case, then go back and look again if you missed anything. The part of your review you should take most to heart is the comment about needing more initiative. Your PE and assessment skills won’t get better passively- you need to push hard to develop them. But if you do that, you will gradually find yourself becoming more confident and competent.","Medical Doctor.

k1ttyhawk,"I was going to ask this as well.Absolutely agree. I am one of those who had to “jump around” not so much as forced to due to others or toxicity which was definitely present at many- mostly moving states. But it took many years of “abuse” to find and absolutely love the clinic and staff I’m with now. IDefinitely. I question docs I don’t work with often over their treatment plans, not because I don’t trust them just because it is new to me and I want to learn. And I always tell them I’m not questioning their abilities, mostly out of not wanting to upset them ofc. But I have also in doing that caught mistakes and they’re appreciative I bring it up. We’re human after all.Definitely. I agree there’s a hierarchy that’s needs respected but that they also respect you.I don’t think this DVM is acting entitled. It’s not wrong to be wanted to be called Dr.  also I don’t think they care, except the fact they are the only Dr. not being referred to as Dr. Also, it is not wrong to ask advice about what to do when you feel you are being singled out. Having the respect of your TEAM is important, and caring is in the nature of a vet and animal lover.I get this. It’s so hard for me to call the doctors I work with by their first names even when they tell me to. It’s a respect thing, you earned that degree. That being said if multiple techs called you by your first then others, even if not told it’s ok, may start to do the same.I’m sorry you are going thru thisI worked at a clinic that didn’t allow it. We had a doctor come in and ask to be referred by her first name and the owner, another DVM, pulled her aside and said that it’s not acceptable that all DVMs here go by Dr.___I would find it “ok” if all the doctors were called by their first names, but you specifically say they only call you by you fn and they call the others Dr.____. Are you maybe the same age as this tech and they see you more as a peer?Also this was a lovely clinic, I miss every single one of them, and the owner was a very generous nice person. He just felt the title is earned and should be respectedI don’t think it has anything to do with respect, just being the same age and having similarities can make someone think it’s ok to get personal.Yes.

Creepy_Philosophy_17,"New grad here too. Not quite sure about the west coast but I heard CA pays more than the east coast regions due to high taxes, and I was offered 120K-140K by different companies and these were like 30-1hr drive from the HCOL area east coast. My friends were offered 170-180K in NYC HCOL area. I feel like OC CA is extremely HCOL area so you should ask for more base salary. Also probs ask for more PTO and more CE?yes, I am aware of that, but isn't there a contract/ offer letter signing?? 

Is there nothing like that? I was wondering when would you ""sign"" a legal document with them. 

Thanks!!Yes, I do know that I will be penalized if I decline as I said above. However, just wanted to know the General timeline of what happens after the match! 

Situation changed from when I ranked and applied, and just after the withdrawal deadline, so I am struggling to figure out how I could deal with it.March 4th isn’t it?I will try my best not to, and hopefully I won’t have to, if I match. Thanks so much for giving me very through explanation! 
I do have an extenuating circumstance that involves my family financially, so might have to support them and with internship salary, I won’t be able to, but I really want to specialize. I wasn’t quite sure what to do, so I thought asking would be better.  Thanks so much for helping out!!Thanks so much!!!Thank you so much!

I heard it was 11 hrs with 1 day and 3 days 8 hrs, not quite sure how hard it is during the day. I might ask that question to the hospital staff! 

It is a compete, so great for me! 

I did hear that they do have great mentorship, but not so sure how they run it. 

I'll do some more research! thanks so much!!Okay, got it!!! Thanks so much for explaining :)Most corporates do!!!Yeah, definitely heard all about and researched about corporates, since most of my school people are from the states. However, I need a working visa and green card to work in the states and I don’t think any non-corporates would sponsor those.","Medical Doctor (or Medical Student).

Last few months have had up to a week with no traffic, then short burst of traffic, such as over a weekend.  Could be the number of nodes coming up on the network.  The more nodes there are, the less traffic per node..  unless there is an increase in users to match.   You also might be in a currently less desirable location, which could change day to day.

You actually can find and chose a node in a good location to connect to.. so you are directly connecting to the node you are using and paying that specific operator in MYST tokens.   When the node operator cashes out by transferring the earnings to a wallet,  there's a fee for that, so I suspect that is when the devs are getting their cut.   But that is separate from the many connections made that node.Have you tried logging into the GUI on a node rather  than just the dashboard?

I've seen issues where token balances were not visible until there was MATIC in the associated wallet, that might be your situation. 

Of course always double check address for accuracy.Mine has done that before, still not sure the exact cause, but a system reboot fixed whatever it was.Power cycle or restart whatever device you are using, when it loads fresh it may clear up whatever the problem was if something was hung up.Did you login locally to your node and check the address for payout is correct?Depends on their purpose.

I doubt it is your average web user connected.I've sometimes had that happen after a reboot, if everything else is set correctly (and I yours was since it worked before.. )  just leave it on for a while, sometimes it takes several hours to a day to correct itself.        Any time I change something that requires a reboot, it does that again, but even without monitoring, I was able to verify it was still working by going to the local login and seeing users online.

At one point I contacted their customer service about it, they said it was fine and to be patient for the monitoring to be seen by the website.

The Mysterium system doesn't control your shown location, it is only picking up what is shown by your connection. They cannot control that from their end.  Since it is your internet connection, that does actually make you the client for ip2location. 

They MYST nodes don't produce quickly, but steadily in my experience.  Best ways to improve your earnings is to open the Node UI and make sure all 3 toggles are turned on.

Temporarily disabled antivirus just long enough to download it, and install  (no other windows, browser, or anything else open)

I've not encountered it, but it is known that many anti-virus programs will identify anything related to crypto as unwanted. 

This is happening because a few unscrupulous people hide the miners inside other programs, essentially stealing someone else's resources to mine with,  so the antivirus sees them as acting like a virus..  and when it sees the same signature when not hidden inside another file, it still assumes its a virus, when in actuality it is what we want to run. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/12esxbg/mysterium_is_a_malware/jhbnr7a/  You're a lifesaver, was trying to figure that out after setting up a node incorrectly..  now if I can just figure out how to get MYST added under Polygon instead of Etherium to actually have a new address, I'll be set. ---> /r/MysteriumNetwork/comments/11s41em/change_wallet_address_native_windows_node/jgv5ltu/  I prefer to avoid metamask (I have my reasons)..

I hope that you can find a person or people to help you develop both skills and confidence along the way. 

(and also a quick note that depending on where you land, blood draws and catheter placement are something you'll rarely, if ever, need to do).Just your wrists, any other staff impacted or other parts of your hands? Also, are your gloves latex? There are quite a few potential contact allergens in a clinical setting.","Veterinarian.

Handsome-monster-cat,"Clients with $0 upset that we can’t do everything for free. Or even worse are clients that you know have money (human MD seem to be the most guilty of this) who won’t spend money on a fixable problem.Thanks! Great suggestions! I’m opening a startup so I’m at a place where I can decide what benefits to offer and I want to pick things people actually want.And even if you can’t fog a window you can get a job with corporate….Check out this book. It was written by a DVM who is also a mom. 

Pregnancy and Postpartum Considerations for the Veterinary Team https://a.co/d/jl4Ec4gI put My Name, DVM.I think this would be hard as a new grad. You have to do everything in front of the owners which really requires a large amount of confidence. And occasionally euthanasias don’t go as planned which can be really hard for everyone involved. 

In a GP setting you have the benefit of taking the animal “to the back” to have a chance to learn new things away from the owners view. You can spend a minute to look something up or ask a second opinion. 

Vet school is really nothing like being a veterinarian. It’s normal to be burnt out. Have you done any externships yet? You might get excited again once you get to see how things work in real life.The medicine in shelters is not as intense as in private practice and you have lots of time to look things up. Surgical skills are hugely important in shelter med. If you are interested in it go for it! Mentorship is pretty shit everywhere (private practice too) because everyone is overworked and tired.Busy small animal corporate GP in New Mexico. I work 3 days a week and one half day Saturday per month. 110k base salary, 21.5% production + $12k medical director stipend, 3 weeks PTO, $3500 discretionary fund which also includes my AVMA and PLIT and vin so it’s actually more like $2700 for CE and whatever. Female, 5 years out of school.Yes it’s definitely possible and I know several people who did. You need to be very confident and fast at spay and neuter so you’ll need to do some extra training than your school offers. But a lot of the medicine aspects of shelter medicine can be easier than GP because it’s a lot of herd medicine (URIs, diarrhea, etc). If you want to do it, go for it! Shelters need great vets too!You might find that the salary only job makes you less stressed about your production numbers. It might be a better environment to learn. But I would also heavily consider the mentorship at each location and go with the one that seems like it would give better mentorship.https://nexgenvetrx.com/blog/nondomesticsexotics/immobilizationsedation/requirements-for-wildlife-veterinarians/I do try to understand where owners are coming from and try not to react negatively (at least initially). Even as a former shelter vet who saw some terrible things, I think most of the time it’s a matter of people not understanding vs actual malice. 

I do have certain things that I won’t budge on. For example I won’t surgically correct heritable traits without spaying or neutering the pet. So umbilical hernias or cherry eyes or brachycephalic airways. And people will always say “well I don’t plan on breeding”, but I think it’s bad medicine and I won’t do it.I actually do! Whenever I see an intact dog with horrible skin allergies I strongly urge spay/neuter. I’ve even convinced some people to do it!Vetspire is incredibly frustrating to use, so I wouldn’t call it “good software”. It looks pretty but doesn’t have the functionality to make my every day life better. There are so many bugs that you now get to vote on which ones they should fix first. If you want to build your own PMS, I would highly recommend spending time in a vet clinic (or several) to see how we actually need a software to function. It might also be valuable to focus on a single type of practice (general practice vs specialty vs emergency vs equine, etc) and build a software that fits them very well. Vetspire tried to do too many things and ended up doing basic things very poorly.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian.

Affectionate_Net_213,"I work in clinics with computers in exam room, I talk while I examine and pause to enter important details.  

If it’s a second opinion or complex case, I get the info first. Or if the pet looks stressed and needs a few minutes to relax in the exam room.

It is super important to be concise, and efficient.When I was an ECC intern at a private practice where my longest shift was 28 hours…. Physical exercise helped tremendously.  There was a 24h gym nearby and I would go when my shift ended (2-3am) and exercise, then go home and sleep.  Definitely helps your body reset, but yeah…. I was definitely tired!Where I am, elective declaw is banned. I have taken off several single claws in cases of infection and trauma with no issue.  Clients are usually grateful for the option after dealing with weeks/months of pain, medications and culture testing.How recent is “pretty recent”? As a veterinarian, it naturally takes time to be able to trust someone else to prevent everyone from getting hurt.  I’ve worked with some amazing restrainers, but until I see them in action and feel comfortable, I won’t ask them to restrain a fractious animal.  

I would give it some time, keep offering. Sometimes just jumping in to be a “butt holder” shows initiative and understanding.Everything they offer should be written into the contract, if it’s not, there’s no recourse if they decide to no longer offer it.

There are employment lawyers in every major city, just ask around for recommendations (if you have a local Facebook group it’s a great place to gather recommendations).  Generally a consult (they review the contract and advise) will be $250-500, it will be money well spent.

You should absolutely have an employment lawyer review every single contract before signing.It’s generally much better to get your own policy and have your employer reimburse you.  That way you know that the premium is covered (ie what happens if they lapse a payment and you are uninsured and happen to be sued?).  This way you also get to know exactly what your coverage is, as there is always a risk that a lawsuit could name the clinic and you personally.  

Law wouldn’t be a profession if no one ever screwed someone else over.Not in the USA. If you can do it for <$100,000, it’s probably worth it.No offence, but you need therapy to deal with your phobia before you even think of applying for vet school.  There is not a vet out there who does not get bit at some point in their career.  Even if you get bit, you need to be able to keep your cool and not “freak out”.Myself and every mom vet I personally know continued to do surgery while pregnant.  I actually much preferred that over trying to examine 80+ lb bouncy dogs.This is weird practice, I would be looking for work elsewhere.  

It’s standard to be able to quote routine procedures even over the phone to non-clients.also 15 years out, worked in Canada and USA and this is standard.When I was pregnant I sat all the time for surgeries which allowed it. Abdominal explores still needed to stand though.Interesting!  I did my private internship a long time ago now, but it was the opposite back then. The university interns had it pretty good compared to the essentially free labour we offered private practice (I often worked 20 hours per day).  Learned a lot though.Stay away from UPEI, their case load is very low and you will not get as many opportunities for networking and case management.Be mindful that you don’t overstep your role, it’s likely that many of the questions the client asked should have resulted in an appointment being made with the veterinarian.  As a receptionist, it’s not your role to discuss medications with a client when they don’t even have a diagnosis (you said it was first seizure - it could have been due to hypoglycemia, toxin, epilepsy, brain tumour…)If the owner was in another state, honestly it should have been a very short call directing them to an emergency hospital. 

Answering questions about drugs not prescribed, especially around doses (since many people have Valium/diazepam at home) definitely borders on practicing without a license, which you need to be extremely mindful of.  As an assistant/receptionist/vet tech you cannot discuss medications not prescribed, and many times if drugs are prescribed you should be checking your answers with the DVM first. 

If the hospital DVM is not available, again, it’s a very short call.  You can offer to take a message and pass it to the DVM and direct them to emergency services.Don’t call.  Go to the clinics in person. Bring a load of donuts or treats, ask to meet the office manager and bring a resume with you, even if you are just looking for volunteer experience. Cold calls never work.If I could go back I would 100% be a medical doctor.  I would argue I work significantly harder and earn significantly less than my friends who are MDs.  My job is definitely cooler though.As a vet tech, cell bio is not the most important thing in the world.  However, as a vet it is pretty important.  When a patient is in hypovolemic shock and they aren’t able to oxygenate their tissues properly (and oxygen is used in the cells during cellular respiration to make ATP which powers the cells), the cell metabolism has to switch to anaerobic which produces lactate, that leads to metabolic acidosis… all of this changes how we treat the patients!","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

CapitalFill4,"People with a passion tend to follow the passion against all reason. That’s why we‘re all here. There are admittedly parts of me that are bitter that this career isn’t as lucrative as I’d hoped but I feel I can confidently say I wouldn’t be happier as a MD. I’d have more money which would fix a LOT of problems (especially given some other life circumstances), but even as a vet I lament that I don’t have my dream job within the field (zoo med), I can only imagine that feeling would be worse if i was a MD even more removed from animals. 

if you didn’t feel that strongly one way or another, I’d say go to med school depending on what your goals are. At some level the money is worth it. I can assure you life is even more expensive than you think it’ll be. that said, don’t give in to lifestyle creep and you, at the very least, should live a comfortable and fulfilled life in vet med. there are ways to manage debt and a household, but the vast majority of Americans who make far less than us can’t materialize money like we can with a relief shift here or there. If you’re a passionate clinician and want money, you’ll get a residency (without having to do a million fellowships and whatnot) and healthy salary eventually. probably won’t make human money, but you’ll still be a-ok.I don’t necessarily think more schools is a problem (at least not yet) but what’s interesting to me is that a lot of these are popping up universities people have never heard of and it makes me wonder if they attract students who otherwise wouldn’t get into places. it feels like several of the schools don’t have strong legacies in teaching or vet med in any real capacity - you can’t just throw professionals together and learn to create new competent doctors overnight. More elite and storied schools shouldnt be gatekeepers for the field but I can’t imagine it’s a net positive to rush these approvals.I went to Cornell, 2020 grad, and I adored it. theres a general notion at Cornell that grad students aren’t supported very well, and I think a lot of that is very valid (and I would imagine is similar across bigger research universities), there are a lot of fair institutional critiques. But I found 95% of my professors (and \~75-85% of the interns/residents) warm and welcoming. The town grows on you and is a charming place to live for 4 short years. We were out of class by 2-3 most days so I thought there was adequate study time (though some may disagree, I was def not an overachiever). Very much recommend, at least for in-state applicants.Care to share a bit more about this? I have a bit of a fish background myself so I’m intrigued.as others have said, the former is redundant and incorrect, as well as cluttered. I grew up seeing it as normal (as if you’re saying hi I’m dr xyx, I’m a doctor of abc) but once that was pointed out to me I can’t see it any other way.

I went with Firstname Lastname, DVM. In my area at least, there’s no ambiguity that I’m a doc (even if they don’t necessarily know what our training entails or what the letters mean) and I just think it looks better, a little reminder that your title comes from a specific degree, not a more nebulous path. It’s an opportunity for education and normalizes the letters Imo.I actually agree with your overall point (though sorry, I don’t know what those degrees are, heh), and I’d go a step farther and say i dont understand why we call people doctor outside of work, but what I really meant to say was that I think it’s good for clients to get a glimpse into what goes into becoming a vet. It’s not a title a tech can gain through experience, it’s not an associates degree or a bachelors, etc. it’s a doctorate program totally distinct from human med, and at least in the states, there’s only 1 way to get it (even if the letters might vary a bit between colleges). 

granted, i said in my OP that in my area that most people recognize it as its own thing already, and seeing the letters themselves doesn’t tell a client how we got it. maybe i just like to see the letters idk, it feels more formal and nuanced.Any insight into how far that salary goes in chicago? One of the cities I’ve wanted to live in but I expected salary to be higher (unless that’s understating how much they’ll get in bonuses).haha no I appreciate the elaboration. I’m no longer in practice (albeit only 4 years out of school), but when I left I was making \~115-120k in upstate/western NY. It’s good for the area, but when I learned a friend of mine in Brooklyn was making 180+ starting out, I wondered if it was worth the move (which is also why I was surprised Chicago was so much lower). I get having more value in a smaller city, but even if I doubled my rent and food costs it seems like one should still net a lot more cash in a bigger city. I recall another thread where a GP in Cali said they made over 200k and it was \*well\* worth it. Idk, I like where I am but the allure of a more lively city is haunting. Don’t wanna get there and bottom out financially but I have a hard time wrapping my head around that happening.3 years out and I still feel like I don’t know as much as I should. Everybody will tell you ”that’s how everybody feels,” which on some level is very true. In practice (or in Facebook groups) youll see new grads and seasoned vets alike asking questions about seemingly basic things you know and you’ll wonder how they don’t know it.  you’ll realize there’s even less of a consensus on how to diagnose or treat certain things than you expected. vet school is about teaching you how to arrive at an answer, not how to conjure one up. Within months you’ll be able to ”diagnose“ some things from the history alone because youve seen them so often. You’ll find that experienced vets often can’t explain things very well because they just come so naturally to them on experience alone. 

THAT SAID, not all vets are created equal. SOMEBODY has to know less than the others. I was confident that person was me because i had a lot of life matters to deal with in vet school. i missed a lot of time, I played a lot of catch-up, I didn’t have time for a lot of extra curricular clubs and labs. I \*knew\* that i knew less. but ya know what? Nobody could tell, and it didn’t matter. 

remember these things:

-your clients can’t tell the difference. even if you don’t know something basic, every client thinks their pet is the unique outlier thats fooling the doc (and they won’t blame you, they’ll get a laugh out of it). In any given heart case, it doesnt matter to you, the pet, or the client whether you remember how to treat an addisonian. Everybody has gaps in their knowledge - it is irrelevant to the case at hand how many or which gaps you have (outside the one at hand of course) 

-don’t kill yourself on studying on your own time in practice - I’ve had multiple mentors tell me to just review things as they come up. I find this frustrating advice because you wanna be fast and efficient in clinic, but it’s the better way to keep you sane. Know the basics like CPR and POC US whatnot but don’t kill yourself researching how to treat something you may not see for 3 years (And in the moment, your colleagues will tell you what they do differently anyway, and you’ll adopt their method because it’s either faster or you’ll find peace in knowing they can answer questions about their method better than they can for the one you were taught)

  
-you know more than you think you do. \*starting\* a case is usually easy  There are only so many things to start with and by being an animal lover and scientifically inclined person at all youll have a good idea how to start. From there you just follow the results. And if you don’t know the algorithm, it doesn’t matter. Do you know how to do a cytology? Great, you’ve bought yourself time to check VIN or ask your colleagues about a weird derm case. Not have any idea how to manage a dog with comorbidities or multiple drugs? Doesn’t matter. Tell the client you have to see if we have room to adjust their dosage and use that time to ask everybody in the clinic what they would do. Vet med is hard, but looking like you know more than people who objectively know less is not the hard part.How has your experience been in relief so far? Im 3 years out and just left for government. I love the amount of PTO i have and feel compelled to stay for PSLF but I don’t think the salary is sustainable. almost seems worth it to have a higher loan payment.Take advantage of extra/curricular labs/lectures/experiences, etc - I definitely under-appreciated how much I would remember from classes on the job so now I wish I was exposed to more things sooner (because I’d feel more comfortable doing them without a more formal refresher than younger me thought I would be). 

But only once you’ve taken care of your actual coursework, sleep, exercise, and reasonable amount of time for life and hobbies. Yes vet school was hard, but the time is there. You don’t need to devote every minute of every day - an A isn’t worth it. 

And for the love of god, learn some basic exotic pet medicine, we’re dying out here. Everybody, imo, be able to at least start management of, and educate an owner on, a ferret insulinoma or vaccine reaction, rabbit GI stasis, reptile husbandry, and bird feather picking.Not everyone can do this but to me the answer is work less. The key to work-life balance imo is to be home by 4 or 5. Given my commitments/routines/etc, I find it need 5-6 hours in the evening to feel like I didn’t waste the entire day at work (granted I go to bed later than most) and to leave some true leisure time. Sometimes this means loading 2 or 3 days a week to make the others shorter but I felt noticeably better when I cut from 38 to 32. 

caveat: I don’t have kids

but also, I have a chronic condition for which I do 30-60 minutes of physical therapy for every morning and evening. Not including exercise. If I can find time, almost anybody can.","Medical Doctor or Veterinarian:

Vet_Squared,"I'm a second year student, not on a traditional path either, and I'm interested in equine med, which only a handful of my classmates are interested in pursuing, so I definitely understand where you're coming from.  It's hard when you are/feel very different from the mainstream.  I would also like to point out that your advisor's opinion is just that - an opinion, ONE person's opinion.  It's good to take the advice into account (that's what advisors are for), but don't let it stop you from pursuing an avenue of interest.  I also acknowledge that it's hard to know what you want at this point (me too.)  I've been told that that is very normal at this point on our journey.  Please don't feel alone - there are other peeps out there like you - I'm one!  If it makes you feel any better, at my school, path students are encouraged, prized, and nurtured since they're rare, and as Asleep\_Leopard says, the industry is hurting for future pathologists.  Keep soul searching and ruminating, and I'm sure you'll find the right answer for you.  I feel existential crisis-y at least three times a week lately.  Hang in there!I don't have any advice but just want to relate.  Also a non-trad, older student who is headed to SA med for a few years directly after graduation even though LA med is what makes my heart go pitter-patter.  I don't know that I want to specialize, but I do worry that in not taking the ""correct"" off-ramp to internship/residencies at graduation, I'm hamstringing my ability to specialize.  But I have mentors who advise that vet med is flexible and even though there will be challenges, it's doable to take your career in different directions on any timeline.  It still feels nervous-making, though.  I wish us luck, and if we took a different path than most to vet school, why not a different path to specialization?  #autviaminveniamautfaciam","Other.

FrostyMeowmeow,"I had a similar feeling when I first started working as a veterinary assistant in 2015 after I graduated college, and it took a year of ""soul searching"" to figure out what I wanted to do with my career, as my degree was in general biology with a pre-med track. I decided medical school wasn't my calling and enjoyed the concept of medicine, but also the concept of zoology.


I shadowed for a few weeks with a general practitioner before applying for several clinics. I finally got a job, and the whiplash alongside the learning curve was highly discouraging. I vividly remember thinking at the end of my second week, ""What the hell did I get myself into?""


The learning curve is STEEP, but you'll learn to celebrate small victories. It's okay to feel as if your client interactions don't go smoothly or if you could've done something better handling an animal or assisting with a procedure.

My first goal in veterinary school was to obtain enough information to be a small animal general practitioner. During my last year of clinics, I realized the world of medicine is MUCH MUCH MUCH more profound than it appears. I'm finishing my last year of specialty training (almost four years post-doc). The further you get along in your training, the more science you incorporate into clinical practice.

I decided to do a small animal internal medicine residency because it's not GP. GP practitioners have demanding jobs in that they see high volume, are expected to be jacks of all trades, and must be highly pragmatic in diagnostic choices as frontline doctors. 

I'm fortunate to pick up where they left off after several weeks to months of diagnostics and management strategies. They do the filtering to recommend motivated owners to see a specialist. Internal medicine is still very client-heavy interaction. However, remember that other specialties do not necessarily require front-facing interactions with the public; you are still expected to have communication skills to interact with your colleagues and paraprofessional team, and depending on where you do your training -- students. Specialty is dependent on your interactions in the clinic with specialists in your area of interest, but also part of the pre-clinical curriculum with activities and clubs that serve as networking opportunities. These aren't things to worry about just yet -- you'll have plenty of time to investigate should you continue schooling.

Take it one day at a time. It will be hard, but there will also be great days along the road that make you look back with a big smile on your face, knowing that you've made a difference in somebody and their best friends' lives.","Veterinarian.
